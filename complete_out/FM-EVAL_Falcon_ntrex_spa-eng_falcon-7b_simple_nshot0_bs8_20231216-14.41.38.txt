The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that the United States is in violation of international law by detaining and torturing prisoners at Guantánamo Bay. The court’s decision, which was released on Thursday, is the first time that the ICJ has ruled on the legality of the detention of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay.

The men were captured in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks and were accused of being members of al-Qaeda.
