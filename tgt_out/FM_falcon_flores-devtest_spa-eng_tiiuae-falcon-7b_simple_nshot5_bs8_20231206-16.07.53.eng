Today, there is no evidence that any drug is effective in treating the infection caused by ebola, even though there is an experimental vaccine that appears to be able to reduce the mortality rate caused by this disease.
Zmapp, a combination of antibodies, had a promising start in the field, but formal studies showed that it was less effective than expected in preventing death.
In the essay PALM, the function of Zmapp was as a control, i.e. that the scientists used it as a base and compared it with the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the note from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family create a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and their sports can be better served if we move forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than the withdrawal of certifications.

The goal of USA Gymnastics and the USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and enhanced environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and later for Lyndon B. Johnson's government.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a widely accepted theory, it also offers specific data that fossils generally don't, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this bird has a reddish-brown plumage on the top and a pale or carotenoid color on the bottom.
In addition, the discovery helps us to understand better the evolution of bird feathers.
Given that the plumage of dinosaurs lacks a well-developed axis, called a raxis, but does have other features of feathers (hairs and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raxis is probably the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but to temperature regulation or as an indicator of the same.
The experts' comments were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a hatchling.
In the morning of yesterday, in Gaziantep, Turkey, a car bomb killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

It was discovered that the sun was ruled by the same basic principles as other stars: the only factors that drove its activity within the system were its luminosity and its rotation.
The intensity of the light and the rotation are combined to calculate the number of Rossby of a star, linked to the plasma flow.
With a smaller number of Rossby waves, the star has a smaller magnetic activity in relation to its magnetic inversions.

Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who currently holds the position of senator and is the first lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city located 50 km (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will run for president.
The Teatro Argentino was the place where Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president; this is the same place where she began her campaign for the Senate in 2005, in the name of the province of Buenos Aires.
The issue that gave rise to the debate was the controversy surrounding the budget earmarked for relief and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina, which some conservatives labeled around the time as the "New Orleans Agreement of Bush."
The criticisms of the liberals in relation to the works of restoration have their focus on the fact that the contracts for reconstruction have been given to people who, apparently, are Washington officials.

Although it was a purely theoretical work, the program was written with the aim of simulating the observations made of the galaxy of Sagittarius.
It would be the gravitational pull of the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the galaxy of Sagittarius in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes the tides.
The experts came to the conclusion that dark matter interacts with itself in the same way as regular matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy is located around it in a class of halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was detected for the first time by Dr. Tony Moll in South Africa's Zululandia.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant "generates a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate."
The doctor Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of the infected were healthcare workers at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can spread the disease to between 10 and 15 people with whom he or she has had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total number of TB patients still seems to be relatively low: 6000 of a total of 333 000 TB patients in a particular moment in South Africa.

Pigs are the carriers of the disease, which then migrates to humans via mosquitoes.
The outbreak has led authorities in India to adopt measures such as the deployment of pig hunters, the distribution of millions of mosquito nets to the population, and the use of pesticides in the most affected areas.
The authorities have also guaranteed several million doses of the vaccine to fight against encephalitis, which will allow the pharmaceutical companies to prepare for the next year.
This year, a shortage of financial resources and a lack of prioritization, compared with other diseases, have led to delays in the delivery of the vaccine in historically vulnerable regions.

In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a cubicle and fill out a preprinted ballot that indicates the candidate they've chosen.
After confirming the voter's identity, he or she enters the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter's list.

The candidates have the right to send representatives to oversee each stage of the process and, during the night, the volunteers count the votes under a rigorous supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

Although there are reports that the official death toll is eight and the authorities have confirmed that around 30 people were injured, the official death toll is still unknown.
Concentrations of cyanuric acid and melamine were found in the urine samples of animals that died after eating contaminated pet food.
Researchers have found that the two compounds react with each other to form crystals that can block the function of the kidneys.
Specialists detected the formation of crystals in the urine of big cats, due to the incorporation of melamine and cyanuric acid.
When compared through the use of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it could be determined that the composition of the crystals is the same as that found in the urine of affected animals.
I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but most of the products coming from Central America to this country were tax-free.
Even so, the countries of Central America imposed tariffs of up to 80 percent on the products we manufacture. We treat you like that.
It didn't make sense to me; definitely wasn't fair.
The only thing I tell people is that you treat us the way we treat you.
A bill proposed by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, would make it illegal to sell or rent violent video games to minors.
The proposed law in California would require violent video games sold in the state to be labeled with an 18-year-old rating and penalizes their sale to minors with a $1000 fine.
The director of the Crown Prosecution Service, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take over the post of business minister that Davey is leaving vacant.
The 16th of February is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21, both died. Alden was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon jammed while aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, can only see with one of his eyes, and part of his skull is missing. His face was reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider provided testimony via a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his country of origin.
Carpanedo took part in two individual races in addition to Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "Did not finish the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished 10th in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four sitting skiers failed to complete their races, and a total of 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the next round.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh was able to recover the laptop and the mobile phone stolen.
The deputy inspector general, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the superintendent of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused presented themselves before the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people in the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver of the red Audi TT from the vehicle.
In the beginning, it was moved to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on trial in the court of the county of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting trial, any eyewitness testimony may be open to question, given that her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists are walking on thin ice when they publish photos or other information about the suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is responsible for the processing, said it would not make any further comments until the charge sheet is drawn up.
According to the information that has been leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the pre-1967 borders.
Other topics that were discussed included the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to five.
During the complementary control of pests, the game wardens had to supervise the shooters closely, given that they were being monitored and evaluated for their effectiveness.
In a partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales Association of Sporting Shooters (NSW), volunteers were recruited from within the Association of Sporting Shooters.
Mick O'Flynn, who is currently in charge, provisionally, of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, noted that a comprehensive training and safety package was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it's the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the widespread protests that began in October against the regime.
Demonstrations, at times violent, were sparked by the fact that no elections have been held, in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 iPods have been reported to have problems with overheating, leading to six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "non-serious."
The ministry commented on the delay in Apple's report, saying that it was "truly regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by a 7.2-magnitude earthquake at 7:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage on the territory.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, an ex-police officer seized a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 rifle against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went on to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in the early 1950s.
Liggins began his research on preterm birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that government investigators were able to recover the flight data recorders from the black box.
Luna's companions also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Dusty Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as I was; even more so. I love her and I miss her. I hope she's in a better place."
Between 2008 and the 2010 federal elections, there was a 8% increase in the number of people who were opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II had ended.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In one end of the survey, 29% of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, 31% think that it should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle had to swim in the freestyle style, and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been called into question after his complaints.
She has not been able to take painkillers to relieve her pain, because they are prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using a variety of hardware and software and it was announced on February 1st.
It is possible that comets have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of scientists is to understand how planets are formed, in particular our own, given that comets have collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law that allows people of the same sex to marry.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce flight distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old technology of ground-based radar, with the aim of enabling air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. There will be no parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possibility of a lack of transport, it was considered that the game would be played behind closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the journal Science reported on the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that the new species was able to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the reproductive isolation between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migratory, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it can be used to decorate illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator of pH using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will change depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in a chemical product determines its level of pH.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of taking a proton away from an electron.
Mix both dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, roll them into a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture on your hands and the external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with drainage in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
In some Minoan homes in the cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had latrines and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is making use of a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space using a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the light from the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and view that we see.
A giant rocket is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster way to travel.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the automobile, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized carnivores that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small felids (which include domestic cats) that prey on species of small size that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males from the same family group, joined by up to thirty females and their young.
In general, females are closely related to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behavior as packs of wolves or dogs, with which they share a surprising similarity (unlike the other great cats) in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger is an all-rounder, able to climb (but not very well), swim, dive and pull five times as hard as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. If possible, they will hunt monkeys, rodents, birds and reptiles. Most of their prey will be much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) using their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and can move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
Over time, as the population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be able to be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an ineludible and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
Plants generate their food through photosynthesis. They also offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except for other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as a second group of teeth in the palate, which meant that anything that got in its way had no chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and even could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a Tyrannosaurus Rex was a threat to it.
While most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that distinguished the rich from the poor was that the poor ate sitting down while the rich reclined to eat.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome include foods that arrived in Europe centuries after they were developed in the Americas or Asia.
In short, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate and no Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
Temples have an open courtyard, followed by an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
In some cases, special pyramidal towers were built, called ziggurats, to form part of temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for its deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were little more than showrooms that faced the street. Houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests; as a result, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to its discovery, the Eskimos already inhabited the area at that time.
Although each Scandinavian country was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. The back of the document does contain something written, but it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Independence original of July 4, 1776". The text is written on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that the huge document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it's likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
Although the D-Day landings had succeeded in liberating the north of France, the south still remained to be conquered.
His government was in the hands of the Vichy French, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that forms part of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, as well as civitas, which means city or city state, and which also determines the size of the society.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy, and a homogenous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving much of a historical trace, and are not recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, given that it lacked a national executive or judicial branch, this function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate in order to enforce all of its laws.
He was not empowered to annul tax laws or customs duties between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed to their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second-most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
There are around 7,000 islands in Japan, the largest of which is Honshu, making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European mariners who were sailing in the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal region of northern Taiwan in 1683 and declared it as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and work continues to this day.
As an example, the most common format for fixed-lens photography around the world is 35mm, which was the most commonly used film size towards the end of the era of film photography.
Today, it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship has been transferred to the image sensors of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35mm format is confusing, as its measurements are 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by twelve in order to calculate the simplest ratio of integers) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS format) are similar or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing a certain order to be imposed on the images.
Indicates that the most effective place to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power was felt everywhere, from the monarch to the commoner.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church should be used for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, this measure violated the generally recognized international legal principle and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted water from international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral ships at risk.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would find a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody civil war broke out among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military. Instead of basing promotions on social class, they are now based on merit.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other working-class people in other countries to take up their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, realistically illustrates the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca lies a cave that is totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it's very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains in the vicinity. From the interior of this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The "upward arrow" mark is similar to a V and the "downward arrow" mark is similar to a grapheme or a square with its bottom edge missing.
Above means to start at the tip and push the bow, and below means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
An upward bow produces a softer sound, while a downward bow is more forceful and percussive.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on stringed instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and his sister-in-law, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threw threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage all the way.
At one point, a participant in the revolution shook the head of a beheaded guard in front of the queen, who was in a panic.
The Filipino people paid the costs of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the United States with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From the start, the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of profits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in which these events take place is known as the High Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from the impetus or imperative of technology to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and how it is related to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on a path independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new techniques of manufacture are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also leads to a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded people and, with the passage of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its status declined, especially due to the return of the Crusaders, who brought back expensive gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The cusp of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the way people dressed was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could take a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of this period was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Agriculture of subsistence is understood to be that which aims to produce enough food to feed only the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds from the region's ecoregion with the rotation of crops or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of most farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of social marginality. They provide a means of generating a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic traits of their membership by using distinctive and symbolic styles, such as fashion, gestures, and slang.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for graphing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, bad luck, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by their parents, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children have suffered traumatic experiences or severe abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When a child is raised exclusively by non-human animals, it presents behaviors (within its physical capabilities) almost identical to those of the specific animal it was raised by, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are going through a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
The andamiaje can be presented in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of andamiaje, but so is the small animated sticky note in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been too complex for the student to understand on their own.
Children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care or education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family-based foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education, and reliable medical care.
The goal of the foster home is to meet all the needs that were not met in the home from which the child was removed.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" have been identified as significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
In a study of users' reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "long-term relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of micorexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few hundredths of a second.
Specifically, it is claimed that, by reading a person's microexpressions, it is possible to detect if they are lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Discourse", explained how those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of the speaker with precision.
It also suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes that variation from the set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the genetic variation from one generation to the next.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of a human, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the resources available in the vegetation.
Not doing so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
Proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been an easier source of food, but they are not easily digested by primates like us, except when cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all of the essential amino acids.
In the end, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors resolved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
The interruption of sleep consists of waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a softer alarm clock that will wake you up without fully waking you up.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a diuretic) before going to bed, which will force you to get up to go to the bathroom.
The level of inner peace enjoyed by a person is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we contend. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in our way is our own tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they have been extended by the path of loving-kindness Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy Kundalini (illumination) is activated with yoga poses, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be cleared, the chakras can be activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who had been allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought on the battlefield, through substitute militias, in fields of battle from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that by September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian head of the bridge.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since time immemorial, the function of the navy has been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The campaign in the North Atlantic in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this traffic.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
With the aim of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes started to keep them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasture, tended by herdsmen who were often children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, railways had been established by the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carriages were made of simple parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and pull heavier loads than they could on the rougher roads of the day.
Early on, sleepers were used to keep the rails in place. However, as time went on, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron.
This became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels and, in 1767, iron rails were used for the first time.
The first form of transport known was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Our ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
While bipedal tracks have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more amicably with the planet, join environmentalist movements or even become activists and fight to lessen, in some way, the suffering of the future.
In many cases, it's like the asintomatic treatment. But if we're not just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and try to deactivate it.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of the human race, and the problems have intensified due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, 1776, a handwritten copy was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, who lived only a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies."
It was John Nixon who read the Declaration of Independence for the first time, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York City on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are birds.
Many people don't think of pterosaurs as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly skin and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work on the manipulation of data encoded in the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are the 0 and the 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be finding an open bottle of medicine or toxic cleaning products.
Read the label for specific information about the first-aid measures for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasitic insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with chinches, a very developed species to parasitize humans.
The bedbugs and clothesbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are reported in the U.S. each year, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies showed that women have twice the chances of men to suffer from EM.
A couple might decide that raising a child wouldn't be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The goal of science is to decipher how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not an experiment. It is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of naturalists as well as philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those on science and psychology, were widely accepted.
As the dominance of the Greek language waned, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many of the rhythms present in physiological processes and in animal behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living organisms, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate on their own and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They carried out two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA of the frog with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism tends to attract people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching and visits to parks, and study of information on the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs, and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place from which they just came.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is connected in some way to a transport system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the last two million years.
They all form part of society and use the transport systems; and almost all of them complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about the quality of drinking water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason that transport systems give rise to such complaints and why do they fail so often? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial going on?
The flow of traffic is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be approximated by a mathematical representation.
With the aim of graphically depicting the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships make it easier to plan and design vehicles, as well as to operate them.
The first species to take to the air were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since we don't perceive the Earth's movement on Earth, right?
The Amazon River is the world's second-longest river and the most voluminous. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total amount of water that flows into the world's oceans from rivers, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of the pyramids of Guiza.
The ancient Egyptian city of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated from more than a thousand years ago.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Italian language is used in the Vatican, both to draft its legislation and to issue its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by the majority of those who work within the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in the Vatican adhere to the Roman Catholic Church.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since antiquity, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It was more similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, but at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. From the outset, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with a small amount of carbon, which are not metals.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, which is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
As a result, when the pencil was invented, it won many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't even need to get close to a pencil.
Only time will tell what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy cart up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, i.e. they tend to disintegrate with the minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more oceans on the side facing the sun because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These theories hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up until they reached maturity.
These theories analyze what causes people to want the things they want and what factors in their environment force them to do or not to do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue to be "one of the guys" (or girls).
Managers in this category find it hard to make decisions that are unpopular with their employees, impose disciplinary measures, carry out performance reviews, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from their staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who feels the need to change everything the group has been doing until now and do it their way.
In the end, the success or failure of the team is the responsibility of the leader.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Often, team members in a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, since it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones that, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organization to submit itself to the process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this, it may be possible for an organization that works as a team to overcome a difficulty to develop a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of its customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, the leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge base and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and make it more precise.
The existing link between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time, it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours can affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with plenty of information and material to develop models of simulation, which help us to understand the mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a speciality of great importance within computer science, which is responsible for the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and consultation requests from customers, as well as facial recognition, handwriting and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-world problems.
Artificial intelligence is now used in many sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering, and the military, just as it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It's very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that can't be reached by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe the objects on display in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the page is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as an album of memories.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when they have a real audience.
Due to the fact that students tend to be the most critical readers, the blogger begins to try to improve his/her writing in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging requires students to be more understanding of the world around them. The need to engage their audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics." (Oravec, 2002)
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are to the south and the north hosts the natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
These aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison that surprises many: more African-Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest island and a continent in itself when it comes to wild life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France. They are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the Comoros and Mayotte by the Arabs, and was largely imposed there.
The initial European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Sahara Desert to the south.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it's not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in your rejection of men and don't be afraid to defend your position (even if there are cultural differences or not, that's not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians, who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of the White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surrounding area of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of knick-knacks, although everything is geared towards the tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the center of the city.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the province of North Kivu.
The city is the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla-watching excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To travel within Goma, you can opt to take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given Tombuctú the image of an exotic and distant land.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List due to the threat posed by the encroaching desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del mundo africano, hosted by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, each of which has a different wild life.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as an icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all of South Africa's nature reserves, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It can also be convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of the same name, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a graph of illuminated bars, with the city's skyscrapers forming the bars.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to Kowloon Bay, which is located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where the city's dense urban development is concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of the past colonial history of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site.
Despite this, the forests are not just mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the once-impressive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wild life and it is estimated that there are now about 400 tigers in the area and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those that travel to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cantilever bridge that spans it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
It is estimated that the bridge will be fully operational by September 2017, which is when it is expected that Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that is now Paraguay's east was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as hunter-gatherers, in addition to practicing subsistence farming.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá indigenous groups lived in the region. They hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spaniards started the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also see other tournaments and lower-level games in other parts of the year.
On the site of the Argentine Association of Polo, you can get information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in relation to the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there. It's in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling is accepted in most places on the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There's a good chance that credit cards won't be accepted on the outer islands, but you may be able to use British or American cash. Check with the owners in advance to find out which method of payment is accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so make sure to do it before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30°C during the summer.
The winter cold can be deceptive: although it is very rare for temperatures to fall below the freezing point, the wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
While many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild life is still wild, so don't feed it or interfere with it.
According to the authorities of the parks, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals.
Even though they may appear docile, bison, uapatíes, elk, bears and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors suffer injuries each year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.
In addition, remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted to the smell of food, so you should avoid cooking food that gives off a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of around 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except for a British cruiser. More than two hundred Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the state's leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches in Auckland, due to the city having two ports. The most well-known are in three areas.
In the district of North Harbour, in the Pacific Ocean, are the beaches of North Shore, which stretch from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
The beaches are almost all made of sand with safe places to swim and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
In the port of Waitemataas, the beaches of Tamaki Drive unfold, in the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach. They are also safe for swimming.
