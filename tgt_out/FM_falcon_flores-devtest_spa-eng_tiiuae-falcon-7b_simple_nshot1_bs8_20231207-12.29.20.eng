In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plumíferos, a theory that is already generally accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this bird has a reddish-brown plumage on the upper part of its body and a pale or carotenoid color on the lower part.
It also allows us to better understand the evolution of the feathers of the birds.
Given that the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed axis, called the raquis, but do have other feather-like features (hairs and quills), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raquis is probably the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure that presents the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but to regulate the temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers maintain that, although it is the tail of a dinosaur young, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The comments of the experts were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

Hokuriku Electric Power Co. declared that the earthquake did not cause any incidents and that the reactors 1 and 2 of its Shika nuclear power plant were shut down.
It was reported that around 9400 homes in the region have water supply and around 100 do not have electricity.
Some roads were damaged, the train service was disrupted in the affected areas, and the airport of Noto, in the prefecture of Ishikawa, is still closed.
A bomb was detonated at the front door of the governor general's office.
Three more bombs were detonated in the immediate vicinity of government buildings in a two-hour period.
While there are reports that the official death toll is eight and the authorities have confirmed that around 30 people were injured, the official death toll is still unknown.
Concentrations of cyanuric acid and melamine were found in the urine samples of animals that died after eating food for pets contaminated.
The researchers indicated that the two compounds react with each other to give rise to crystals that can obstruct the renal function.
Veterinarians detected the formation of crystals in the urine of cats, due to the incorporation of melamine and cyanuric acid.
When compared through the use of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), it was possible to determine that the composition of the crystals coincides with that found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but most of the products coming from Central America to this country are tax-free.
Even so, the countries of Central America imposed tariffs of up to 80 percent on the products we manufacture. They treat us like this.
It didn't make sense to me; it definitely wasn't fair.
All I can say to people is that you treat us the same way we treat you.
A law was proposed by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill proposes that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce will be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take over the post of business minister that Davey leaves vacant.
The 16th of February is the date that Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, aged 25 and 21 respectively, died. This last one was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider had to undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
The gun of Uka jammed while he was aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, he can only see with one of his eyes, part of his skull is missing and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo took part in two individual races apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "Did not finish the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she got the tenth place in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four skiers in the Giant Slalom category failed to complete their races and a total of 117 of 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not reach the classification.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh were able to recover the laptop and the mobile phone that were stolen.
The inspector general adjunto, D.K. Arya, declared: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the superintendent of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused presented themselves before the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people in the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident took place was closed temporarily while the emergency services removed the driver of the Audi TT red.
In the beginning, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on trial in the Court of the County of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
Although she is currently in custody awaiting trial, any eyewitness testimony can be questioned, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or any other information about the suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, said it would not be making any further comment until the indictment is issued.
According to the information that has been leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the pre-1967 border lines.
Other topics that were also discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which both countries consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA is only accepting five.
During the complementary pest control trial, the game wardens had to supervise the shooters closely, as this was being monitored and evaluated.
In a union between the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the New South Wales Association of Sporting Shooters (NSW) Inc., volunteers were recruited who were suitable for the Association's shooting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is currently in charge, provisionally, of the office of Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS Park, said that a full training and safety briefing was given to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it's the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised that the CEP should resign, as part of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the generalised demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
Demonstrations, at times violent, were provoked by the fact that elections are not being carried out, in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, which caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having registered 27 accidents that involved these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry said it was "truly regrettable" that Apple had delayed the release of the report.
Mariana was shaken by a quake at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage on the islands.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer of that country hijacked a bus and held captive tourists who were coming from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 rifle against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers occupied the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on preterm birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that investigators for the Chinese government were able to recover the black boxes from the flight data recorder.
Luna's comrades also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Powder Runnels said: "Luna was as rare as I am; even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Since 2008, among the 1400 people surveyed in advance of the 2010 federal elections, there was a growth of 8 % of those who are opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II was over.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
On one side of the survey, 29 % of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; on the other, 31 % think that it should never become a republic.
The winner of the gold medal in the 100-metre freestyle and 200-metre freestyle, and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt on the basis of his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers to relieve the pain, because their use is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery through the use of various hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was made public on Tuesday.
It is possible that the comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of the scientists is to understand how the planets, in particular our own, were formed, given that comets have crashed into the Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, took office at the beginning of the year and last month he signed a law that allows people of the same sex to marry.
He described the rumours as "political blather and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in the 2016 elections.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
Uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old technology of terrestrial radar, in order to make it possible for air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate data.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered the possibility that the game would be played closed doors, without the fanatics of the team.
On Thursday, the magazine Science published an article about the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from the University of Princeton, in the US, and from the University of Uppsala, in Sweden, announced that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migratory, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can adopt all kinds of forms and be wound up in tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it could be used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator of pH using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of ions of hydrogen (the H in pH) present in the chemical product analysed determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, an ion of hydrogen is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Shake both powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, rub them together to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in their hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
In some homes in the cities of Minoan Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had sanitary facilities in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one is communicating with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the light of the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
We need a giant rocket, more than 100 feet tall, to carry a satellite or telescope to space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster way to travel.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, such as rabbits, hares and deer.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (which include domestic cats that are independent of humans) that feed on smaller species that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, reptiles and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the big cats that socialise the most and their lives take place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their calves.
In general, the females are very close to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behaviour as packs of wolves or dogs, with which they share a surprising similarity (unlike the other great cats) both in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
An integral athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, dive, and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of producing roars.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but rather a prayer of words spoken in growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. As far as possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Most of their prey will be much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) using their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by mimicking their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island), they will often find themselves in a different environment to the one they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, as the growing population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will no longer be possible to classify them as belonging to the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an ineludible and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they emit).
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, therefore, it had nothing to fear, except from other members of its own species.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as another group of teeth in the palate, which means that anything that came into contact with him had no chance of survival.
We don't have the security, but it could have had the viperine. Its diet included tortoises, large fish, other mosasaurids, and even could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a Tyrannosaurus rex was a threat to him.
While the majority of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some less conventional items at their banquets, such as wild boar, peacocks, snails, and even a type of rodent, the lizard.
Another thing that set them apart was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the well-to-do enjoyed sharing banquets and lying on their sides while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of the ancient Rome include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor chocolate and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be their home.
The people carried sacrifices to the gods and the priests sought to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
In some cases, temples were built in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the middle of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
The Jewish families spent the majority of their time outdoors.
The women were cooking in the patio; the shops were only display windows that gave onto the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living in that place at that time.
While each Scandinavian country was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. The reverse side of the document contains something written, but it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Independence of the 4th of July 1776". The text is written on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that the enormous parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation has been added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out on D-Day, as well as the subsequent confrontations, had led to the liberation of the north of France, the south still remained to be liberated.
His government was in the hands of the French of "Vichy", who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed the peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On the 15th of August 1940, Operation Dragoon was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that forms part of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilisation derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, as well as civitas, which means city or city state, and which, in addition, determines the size of the society.
State capitals are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization requires a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy, and a homogenous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognised as civilisations in their own right.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to fix taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, this function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to make all its laws effective.
He was also not empowered to annul fiscal laws or customs duties between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed to their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practised are football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the north, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan there are around 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when the sailors of Europe who sailed through the place registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labour to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal regions of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retains its control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see how they looked originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and work continues to this day.
As an example, the most common image format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the most commonly used film size towards the end of the era of film photography.
Today it is still being produced, but the most important thing is that their dimensional relationship has been transferred to the digital image sensors of the cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is a bit confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by twelve in order to calculate the simplest divisor of integers) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g. APS) are similar or very similar to this relation of appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple rule that generates dynamism as well as order to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had managed to unite the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the rabble.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church should be used for that specific purpose.
The central leadership of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Not long after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, this measure violated the generally recognized international general principle and is contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom withdrew international waters in whole sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting at risk, even, neutral ships.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would find a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the decade of the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out between many noblemen who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was that of the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of the absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, because, instead of basing the charges of the army on classes, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to visit a cave known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave in itself, which has lasted in time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the peak of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one was sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains in the surroundings. From the inside of this cave, you can see and hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramidal structures built to honour the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The brand of "upwards arrow" is similar to a V and the brand of "downwards arrow" is similar to a grapheme or a square without its lower border.
Above means to start at the tip and push the bow, and below means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, while a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the stringed instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Luis Carlos, 4 years old), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threw threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a executed guard in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people paid for the war expenses of the imperialism of E.E. U.U. in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From now on, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will be the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in which these events take place is known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (that is, between the years 1000 and 1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The determinism of technology is a concept that comprehends, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense of that there is a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and that is related to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has “effects” on the societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of cars necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new techniques of manufacture are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography moulded people and, with the passage of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was known as such in the feudal era.
Its fame as the epicentre of luxury began approximately 400 years before Christ and extended until approximately 1100 years before Christ.
During the twelfth century, its status began to decline, especially due to the return of the Crusaders, who brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The cusp of the Gothic style took place in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the first place, the way of dressing received great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the western styles could take a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe started to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
It is understood as subsistence agriculture that whose objective is to produce enough food to meet exclusively the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds from the region's ecoregion with the rotation of crops or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many countries in the process of development.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of social marginality and provide them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to adopt distinctive and symbolic styles, such as fashions, gestures, and slang.
One of the most common mechanisms for graphing the importance of socialization is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, bad luck or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children may have suffered traumatic or severe child abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical capabilities) almost equal to those of the specific animal that took care of it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should make this process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The andamiaje is not a learning technique; it is, on the contrary, an assistance that provides support to those who are going through a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
The andamiaje can be presented either in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of andamiaje, but also so is the small animated paperclip in Microsoft Office.
The virtual andamiajes are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand on their own.
Children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the system of foster care provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical assistance.
The aim of foster care is to meet all the needs that were not met in the home of the child before they were placed in foster care.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the point of view of the concept of rewards and punishments.
For example, it is pointed out that “learning” and “socialization” are significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of the users to the websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), it was also detected the "participation personal" and the "durable relationships" as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few thousandths of a second.
Specifically, it is claimed that, through the correct reading of their microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained the way in which those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate sincerity with precision.
It also suggests that the ability to interpret human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes that variation from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination barter the variation between one and the next generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of a human, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available.
In addition, not doing so can cause serious problems: stunted growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have constituted the simplest source of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except if they are cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors resolved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep consists of waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a soft alarm clock that will make him return to a conscious state, but without waking him up completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person experiences is directly related to the amount of tension that is in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we can deal. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in our way is our own tension and negativity.
While the bases of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread along the path of love Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general terms, laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the channels of energy can be unblocked, the chakras can be activated and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up by distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who had been allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that for the 17th of September 1939 the Polish defence was already broken, its only hope was to give the retreat and reorganize itself in the extension of the Rumania head of bridge.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the fronts of Byelorussia and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, other bilateral and multilateral agreements, treaties and pacts.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since time immemorial, the function of the navy has been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while at the same time, interferes with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The campaign of the North Atlantic in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this traffic.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10 000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the aim of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and skin, the ancient peoples and tribes started to hunt them down.
In general, domestic goats were gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasture, tended by herdsmen who were often children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, the railways had been installed in the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carriages were made of simple parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and carry heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in their place took place quite early on. However, gradually, it was realised that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused a greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels and, in 1767, iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transport that was known was walking. The human being began to do it in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Our predecessors, the Australopithecus, didn't have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedalism have been found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, be part of environmentalist movements or, even, we can become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, the future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like the asymptomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary situation, we should try to find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, at the print shop of John Dunlap, only a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time in the patio of the Independence Hall, on the 8th of July.
On the 6th of July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on the 9th of July. On the 10th of August, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are the birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in the birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have extremities with claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs in the same way as the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work in base to the manipulation of coded data under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are the 0 and the 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be finding a bottle of medicine or cleaning chemicals open.
Read the label for information on the specific first aid measures for this specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasite insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with bedbugs, a species very developed to parasitize humans.
Cockroaches and bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. has risen to about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women have twice the chances of men to suffer from EM.
A couple might conclude that raising a child wouldn't be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide the scientific investigation.
The focus of naturalists as well as philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially in the field of science, were accepted.
As the domain of the Greek language was declining, Western civilization distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Frequently, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in the behaviour depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA consisted of a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using fagos, or viruses.
Two experiments were carried out in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulphur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks, and study of information on the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take photographs and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place from which they have just come.
In this dynamic transfer system, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive economy of carbon has deprived the biosphere of one of its normal states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
They are all part of society and use the transport systems; and almost all of them complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear such complaints about the quality of drinking water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason that the transport systems give rise to so many complaints and why are there so many failures every day? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial going on?
The flow of traffic is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behaviour of the drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to be represented approximately by a mathematical model.
With the aim of graphically clarifying the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both the planning and the design as well as the operations of the traffic control devices.
The first species to take to the skies were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, only the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera are the only insects unable to fold their wings.
Millions of years ago, a man called Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we don't perceive their movement, correct?
The Amazon River is the largest river in the world and the second largest river in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total amount of water that comes from the world's rivers and ends up in the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they could never surpass the pyramids of Guiza, nor in size nor in the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian village of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Italian language is used in the Vatican City, both to draft its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language that is spoken daily by the majority of those who work in the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The entire population of the Vatican City adheres to the Roman Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It had more in common with the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, but at the same time it had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be the elements such as calcium and potassium. From now on, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are traces of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of very small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Because of this, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't even need to get close to a pencil.
Only time will tell what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, i.e. they tend to disintegrate with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more mares on the near side due to the thinner bark, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines support the idea that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up until they reached maturity.
These theories analyze what causes people to want the things they want and what factors in their environment force them to do or not to do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue being “one of the boys” (or girls).
To the managers of this category it is difficult to take decisions that do not go down well with the employees, to impose disciplinary measures, to carry out performance evaluations, to assign responsibilities and to demand accountability from the staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into an unknown person who believes it is necessary to change everything that the group has been doing until now and do it their way.
At the end of the day, the success or failure of the team is down to the leader.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional equipment also apply to virtual equipment, although there are some small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
In general, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, as it is possible for their teams to meet at different times, which may not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a real “invisible team” (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It fixes the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organization to submit itself to the process of establishing an organization for learning? One of the purposes of applying the concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the available resources are used effectively in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this, it is possible that an organization that works as a team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, the leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge base and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and give it greater accuracy.
The correlation existing between brain pathology and abnormal behaviour contributes to the research of scientists.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours can affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a speciality of great relevance within computer science, which is responsible for the behaviour, learning and adaptation of intelligent machines.
The research in the field of AI implies the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and consultation requests from customers, as well as facial recognition, handwriting recognition, voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The artificial intelligence system is now often used in the economy, medicine, engineering and the military, in the same way as it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
School trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual tours. The students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as an album of memories.
Blogs can also contribute to improving the writing of students. Even though students usually start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Due to the fact that students tend to be the most critical readers, the writer of blogs starts to make an effort to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, the blogosphere “demands that students be more understanding of the world around them.” The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics." (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are more to the south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison of the population that causes great surprise to many: there are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The location of the islands of East Africa is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we are talking about wild life.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the Comoros and Mayotte, in large part, by the Arabs.
The initial influence of Europe and colonialism took place in the 15th century, as a result of the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region limits with the Sahel to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their real marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be bold and don't be afraid to defend your position (even if there are cultural differences or not, that's not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians used it as a strategic port, known as Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan articles, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left most of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit to the outside must be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the province of Kivu in the North.
In addition, the city is the base for scaling the volcano Nyiragongo and its mountain gorilla trekking excursions are some of the most economical in Africa.
To get to Goma, you can take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local fare) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, added to the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and faraway image.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, as a result of the threat posed by the sands of the desert.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del Mundo Africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts a lot with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, in each of which a different wild life is developed.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognised as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all the natural reserves of South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selections of parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
It has been compared the deployment of buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong with a luminous bar graph that is evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon side, which is located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is most densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see proof of the past colonial history of this region, this is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans to be a World Heritage Site.
Despite this, the mangroves are not the only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The buses depart from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those that travel to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are usually full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket with some days of advance.
Most of the districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is an easy and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not made available for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that currently constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the guaraníes, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá aboriginal groups lived in the region. They hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spanish started the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal idiosyncrasy.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
The most important polo tournament of the year takes place in the polo fields of Las Cañitas in December.
They can also see other tournaments and lower-level games throughout the year.
On the website of the Argentine Association of Polo you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed at the equivalent of the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there. It is in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling is usually accepted in most places in the Falklands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There is a good chance that credit cards will not be accepted in the outer islands, but you may be able to use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to find out which method of payment is accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money from the Malvinas Islands outside the archipelago, therefore, try to do it before leaving.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
The cold winter can be deceptive: while it is very rare for temperatures to fall below the point of freezing, wind and humidity interact to make it feel even colder than the thermometer indicates.

While many animals in the zoo are accustomed to seeing people, life in the wild is still savage, so we shouldn't feed them or get in their way.
According to the authorities of the parks, it is necessary to maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from the bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals.
No matter how docile they may appear, the truth is that bison, uapatíes, elks, bears and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors suffer injuries every year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid cooking foods that release a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.

During snowstorms, the amount of snow can fall so much that it can trap you in a very short time.
In addition, visibility can be reduced by snow, sleet, or ice that forms on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, in many countries, the conditions of ice and snow are normal and the traffic flows almost without any interruption throughout the year.

The speed limits are notoriously lower than in the previous sections and those that follow, usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and their strict compliance is even more important than in any other section.
However, curiously, the cell phone signal is much better here than in many other sections of the road such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German bakery is of good quality and, in Bavaria, the cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those prepared in Austria, its neighbor to the south.
It is common to find tarts with cooked apples inside all year round and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.

In the same way, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for separate permits for each of the member countries of this space. This will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects older than 100 years are antiques.

The rearing of reindeer is a fundamental way of life for the Laplanders and the culture related to this commercial activity is important for many who are engaged in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Laplanders have been involved in the rearing of reindeer on a large scale, but have lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer, mainly, as draft animals.
Today, many Lapps work in modern commercial activities. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.

Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option for those who plan to take a sabbatical.
This is very popular among school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before university without putting their education at risk.

Normally, a registration fee will be charged for enrolment in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing: the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.

For some, understanding a little about how planes work and what happens during a flight can make it easier to leave behind a fear that stems from a lack of knowledge or a feeling of not having control.
Courier companies are paid very well for fast deliveries. Often, time is very important when it comes to commercial documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
The big companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for the smaller companies and other routes.
If they sent it by air freight, it may have taken a few days for it to be unloaded and cleared by customs.
The only way to do it more quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations prohibit the transport of unaccompanied baggage, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to travel in first class or executive class on a plane is to spend a fortune on that privilege (or, what's better, have your company pay for it).
But this has a price: in general, you can pay up to four times the economic tariff in business class and up to eleven in first class.
It's generally a waste of time to look for discounts for first class or business class seats on direct flights.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a basic group of travellers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and will charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. Its regional language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
