In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a widely accepted theory, also offers specific data that fossils generally don't, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this animal has a reddish-brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotene color on the lower part.
In addition, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Given that the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called a raxis, but does have other features of feathers (hairs and quills), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raxis is probably the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but to regulate body temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a hatchling.
The experts' comments were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a hatchling.
In the morning of yesterday, in Gaziantep, Turkey, a car bomb killed two police officers and injured more than twenty other people.

Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who currently holds the position of senator and is the first lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will run for president.
The Teatro Argentino was the place where Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president; this is the same place where she began her campaign for the Senate in 2005, representing the province of Buenos Aires.

Although it was a highly theoretical work, the program was written with the purpose of simulating the observations made to the galaxy of Sagittarius.
It would be the tidal forces of the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the galaxy of Sagittarius in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes the tides.
The experts came to the conclusion that dark matter interacts with ordinary matter in the same way that ordinary matter interacts with ordinary matter.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy is located around it in a class of halo and is composed of many small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was detected for the first time by Dr. Tony Moll in South Africa's Zululandia area.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant generated “a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate.”
The doctor Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital, and at least two of the infected workers were health care workers at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can spread the disease to between 10 and 15 people with whom they have had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total number of TB patients in South Africa still seems to be low: 6000 of a total of 333 000 patients infected at a particular moment in South Africa.

The authorities have also guaranteed several million doses of the vaccine to fight against the encephalitis, which will allow the health companies to prepare for the next year.
This year, the scarcity of financial resources and the lack of prioritization, compared with other diseases, have led to delays in the execution of the vaccination plans in historically vulnerable regions.

Three more bombs were detonated in the immediate vicinity of government buildings in a two-hour period.
While there are reports that the official death toll is eight and the authorities have confirmed that about 30 people were injured, the official death toll is still unknown.
Concentrations of cyanide and melamine were found in the urine samples of animals that died after eating contaminated pet food.
The researchers indicated that the two compounds react with each other to give rise to crystals that can obstruct renal function.
The experts detected the formation of crystals in the urine of the felines, by the incorporation of melamine and cyanuric acid.
When compared through the use of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it could be determined that the composition of the crystals coincides with that found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but most of the products coming from Central America to this country were free of taxes.
Even so, the countries of Central America imposed tariffs of 80 percent on the products that we manufacture. We treat them to you.
It didn't make sense to me; it definitely wasn't fair.
The only thing I tell people is that you treat us the way we treat you.
A law was proposed by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill would require that violent video games sold in California be labeled with an "18" rating and penalizes their sale to minors with a $1,000 fine.
The director of the Crown Prosecution Service, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take over the business minister's post that Davey is leaving vacant.
The 16th of February is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.

Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed a facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon jammed while he was aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, can't see with one of his eyes, lost part of his skull, and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his country of origin.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races in addition to Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he got a "Did Not Finish" in the first race, as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished 10th in the women's giant slalom with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four skiers in the category failed to complete their races and a total of 45 of 117 participants in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh was able to recover the laptop and the mobile phone that were stolen.
The inspector general's deputy, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the superintendent of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused presented themselves before the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.

In the beginning, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on trial in the Court of the County of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting trial, any eyewitness testimony may be subject to question, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about the suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is responsible for the processing, said it would not make any further comments until the writ of summons is issued.
According to the information that has been leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the existing boundaries prior to the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics that were also addressed included the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to five.
During the complementary control of pests, the game wardens had to supervise the shooters closely, given that they were being monitored and evaluated for their effectiveness.
In a partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales Association of Sporting Shooters (NSW) Inc., volunteers were recruited from within the Association of Sporting Shooters.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the Office of Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, noted that a comprehensive training and safety program was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it's the fifth CEP for Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that are intended to lead the country toward new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the generalized demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The protests, at times violent, were triggered by the fact that elections were not being held, in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunction and overheating have been reported, which have caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "non-serious."
The ministry pronounced itself in relation to the delay in Apple's report, saying it was "truly lamentable."
Mariana was jolted by a quake at 7:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage on the territory.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami warning indicators.
In Manila, capital of the Philippines, a former police officer of that country hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 rifle against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in the early 1950s.
Liggins began his research on preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that government investigators were able to recover the flight data recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Powder Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as I was; even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Between 2008 and the 2010 federal elections, there was a growth of 8% of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she considered Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II had ended.
34% of the respondents share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In one end of the survey, 29% of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, 31% think that it should never become a republic.
The winner of the gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt after his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers to relieve the pain, because their use is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery through the use of various types of hardware and software, and at the beginning of February, it was announced.
Perhaps comets have served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of the scientists is to understand how planets are formed, particularly our own, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law that allows people of the same sex to marry.
He characterized the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
Uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old radar technology on the ground, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. There will be no parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transportation, it was considered the possibility that the game would be played behind closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the journal Science reported on the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, in the U.S., and from Uppsala University, in Sweden, announced that the new species was able to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the reproductive isolation between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migratory, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can adopt all kinds of forms and be wound up in tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it could be used to decorate illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator of pH using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of ions of hydrogen (the H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its level of pH.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Thus, a hydrogen ion is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Stir the two dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, press them together to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in their hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with drainage in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had public toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is making use of a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and view that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster way to travel.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transportation, such as the railroad or the automobile, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, hares, and deer.
Finally, there are many small felids (which include domestic cats) that feed on species of small size that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the big cats that socialize the most and their lives take place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, joined with up to thirty females and their calves.
Usually, the females are closely related to each other, which makes them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behavior as packs of wolves or dogs, with which they share a surprising similarity (unlike the other big cats) in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
A fully integrated athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, dive, and pull five times stronger than a robust person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. Where possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of their prey will be much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) using their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark and, in addition, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by mimicking their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they come (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they can't go back easily), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, as the growing population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will no longer be possible to classify them as the same species.
This process receives the name of speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and it is an ineludible and fundamental consequence of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from the plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except for other members of its own species.
Their long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to another group of teeth in the palate, which means that anything that got in their way, had no escape.
We don't have the security, but it could have had the viperine. Its diet included tortoises, large fish, other mosasaurs, and even could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a T. Rex was a threat to him.
While the majority of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails, and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that set them apart was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the well-to-do enjoyed sharing banquets and reclining while they ate.
It is not possible that the ancient Roman recipes include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
In other words, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no chocolate, and no Romans of antiquity ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by the priests.
Occasionally, special towers with a pyramidal shape were built, called ziggurats, to form part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
The Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only display windows that faced the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him more westward, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to their discovery, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited the area at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits, and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Independence original of July 4, 1776." The text is written on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that the huge document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
While the D-Day landings had succeeded in liberating the north of France, the south still remained to be won.
His government was in the hands of the French "Vichy," which was a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In only two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of a large group of people who live and work together; in other words, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, as well as civitas, which means city or city state, and which, in addition, determines the size of the society.
The state capitals are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy, and a homogenous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilisations in their own right.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, this function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate in order to enforce all of its laws.
He was not empowered to annul tax laws or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed to their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second-most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern parts of the country, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan there are about 7000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago," from a geographic point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European mariners who were sailing in the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal region of northern Taiwan in 1683 and declared it as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see what they looked like originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and work continues to this day.
To illustrate, the most common format for fixed-lens photography at the global level is 35 mm, which was the most commonly used film size toward the end of the era of film photography.
Today it is still being produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship has been transferred to the digital image sensors of cameras.
In truth, the 35mm format is a bit confusing, as its measurements are 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by twelve in order to calculate the simplest common divisor of integers) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g., the APS group of formats) are similar or look very much like this relationship of aspect.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing for a certain order to be given to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the commoner.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church should be used for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Not long after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognized international general principle and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters in whole sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even risking the safety of neutral ships.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would find a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during World War I, the countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a cruel war broke out among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, when thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism toward republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed for the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, because, instead of basing promotions on class, they are now based on merit.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed people in other countries to take up their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured over time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, lies a cave that is totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains in the vicinity. From the interior of this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramidal structures built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead," in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The mark of "upward arc" is similar to a V and the mark of "downward arc" is similar to a grapheme or a square without its lower border.
Above means to start at the tip and push the bow, and below means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The upward movement of the arch generates a softer sound, while a downward movement is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on stringed instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threw threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open all of the windows in their carriage.
At one point, a participant in the revolution shook the head of an executed guard in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people paid the costs of the imperialism of the U.S. in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the U.S. with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From the very beginning, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of profits for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in which these events take place is known as the High Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The determinism of technology is a concept that encompasses, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from the impetus or imperative of technology to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and how it is related to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on a path independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has “effects” on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also leads to a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in the romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded people and, with the passage of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was known as such in feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began approximately 400 B.C. and extended until approximately 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century its status declined, especially due to the return of the Crusaders, who brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The cusp of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the form of dress received great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the western styles could take a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Agriculture of subsistence is understood to be that which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds from the region's ecoregion with the rotation of crops or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of the farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many countries in the path of development.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by the standards of society, and gives them the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic traits of their belonging by using distinctive and symbolic styles, such as fashion, gestures, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for graphing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, bad luck, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild." Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children may have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical capabilities) almost equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference toward people.
Even though project-based learning should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little bit further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a form of assistance that provides support to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new software program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented either in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also is the small animated sticky note in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and their function is to question, stimulate, or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand on their own.
Children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care, or education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family-based care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education, and reliable medical care.
The goal of foster care is to meet all the needs that were not met in the home from which the child was removed.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different traits that characterize the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization have been identified as significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of users to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), participation and long-term relationships were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few hundredths of a second.
Specifically, it is claimed that, through the proper reading of their microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," explained how those who cannot understand speech because of a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate sincerity with precision.
Even suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes that variation from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the genetic variation from one generation to the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of a human, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources available to it.
Not doing so carries serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the most easily accessible sources of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except when cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors had solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees do today.
The interruption of sleep consists of waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a more or less soft alarm clock that will make him return to a conscious state, although not fully awake.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace enjoyed by a person is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we can deal. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that gets in the way is our tension and negativity.
While the bases of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they extended through the path of love Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the channels of energy can be unblocked, the chakras can be activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. When the war ended, the clashes of system, process, and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who had been allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that on September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian head of the bridge.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since time immemorial, the function of the navy has been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the ability of the enemy to do the same.
The campaign of the North Atlantic in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to cut off this circulation.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
It seems that goats were domesticated, for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
With the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat, and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes started to keep them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasture, tended by herdsmen who were often children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, railways had been in place by the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel boards of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and pull heavier loads than they could on the rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place took place quite early. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear and tear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767, iron rails were used for the first time.
The first form of transportation that was known was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, didn't have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedalism have been found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, form part of environmentalist movements or, even, we can become activists and fight to ameliorate, in some measure, the future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary solution, we should try to find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is manifest that the world has suffered great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of the human race, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Hancock, and the Secretary of Congress, Charles Thomson, at Dunlap's printing shop, a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies."
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time and did so in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On the 6th of July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on the 9th of July. On the 10th of August, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are the birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have clawed extremities, lay eggs, and move on their hind legs in the same way as the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers function based on the manipulation of data encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are the 0 and the 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Symptoms, such as, for example, vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be finding an open bottle of medicines or cleaning products containing toxic chemicals.
Read the label for specific information about the first aid measures for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasitic insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with chinches, a very developed species to parasitize humans.
The bedbugs and the clothesbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are reported in the U.S. each year, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from EM.
A couple might conclude that raising a child wouldn't be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The goal of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific investigation.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, in the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially in the area of science and psychology, were accepted.
As the dominance of the Greek language was waning, the West distanced itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Often, many of the rhythms present in physiological processes and in the behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining manner and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA consisted of a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They carried out two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fungus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether it involves germinal cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism tends to attract people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks, and study of information on the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take photographs, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns in their cars to go to their jobs, and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are located in the place from which they just came.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is somehow connected with a system of transportation based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the last two million years.
All are part of society and make use of the transportation systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is not common to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason that transportation systems give rise to such complaints and why do failures occur daily? Are the engineers of transportation simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial that is happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows the traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be represented approximately by mathematical models.
In order to graph more clearly the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both planning and design, as well as the operations of the road network.
The first species to take to the air were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects unable to fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we don't perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon River is the most caudalous and the second most extensive river in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total amount of water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of the pyramids of Guiza.
The ancient Egyptian town of the New Kingdom was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Italian language is used in the Vatican City, both for drafting its legislation and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that is spoken daily by the majority of those who work in the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens who live in the Vatican adhere to the Roman Catholic Church.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, but, at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has a lot of elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. From the outset, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with the presence of small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of very small particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively diminutive that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Because of this, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new methods of writing, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't even need to get close to a pencil.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to disintegrate with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the side that is closer due to the fact that its crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up to reach maturity.
These theories analyze what causes some people to want the things that they do and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue to be “one of the boys” (or girls).
For managers in this category, it is difficult to make decisions that are unpopular with employees, impose disciplinary measures, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and demand accountability from the staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it is necessary to change everything that the group has been doing until now and do it their own way.
At the end of the day, the success or failure of the team is the responsibility of the leader.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their closest physical team.
In general, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet at different times, which, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organization to submit itself to the process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all of the available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this, it may be possible for an organization that works together to overcome a place-based difficulty to innovate a new process to meet the needs of customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge base and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. They therefore reduce the field of research and give it greater precision.
The correlation existing between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time, it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of great relevance within computer science, which is responsible for the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligent machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and consultation requests from customers, as well as facial recognition, handwriting recognition, and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-world problems.
The system of artificial intelligence is now often used in the economy, medicine, engineering, and the military, in the same way that it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study abroad trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium, or contemplate beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as an album of memories.
Blogs can also contribute to improving the writing of students. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with less than careful grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Due to the fact that students tend to be the most critical readers, the blogger begins to try to improve his/her writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Likewise, blogging requires that students be more understanding of the world around them. The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go deeper in their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics.
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are more to the south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting it of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All of these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas more towards the north are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison that causes great surprise to many: more African Americans live in the U.S. than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, without a doubt, the largest and a continent in itself if we are talking about wild life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial influence of Europe and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in rejecting men and don't be afraid to defend your position (even if there are cultural differences or not, that's not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Carthaginians, who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of the White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surrounding area of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of knick-knacks, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the center of the city.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the province of Kivu in the North.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking excursions are some of the most economical in Africa.
To travel within Goma, you can opt to take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, added to the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given Tombuctú the image of an exotic and distant land.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del Mundo Africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, each of which has a different wild life.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all of South Africa's nature reserves, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It can also be convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to all the parks in South Africa or to all the national parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the destination of most tourists who consider it the main attraction.
Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a graph of illuminated bars that shows the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to Kowloon Bay, which is located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where their urban development is most densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of the past colonial history of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans to be a World Heritage Site.
Despite this, the forests are not only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wild life and it is estimated that there are currently 400 tigers in the area, and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those that travel to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts have the Coaster buses from Japan, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cantilever bridge that spans it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not made available for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that is now the eastern part of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The region was home to other aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered, and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spaniards began the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also see other tournaments and lower-level games in other parts of the year.
On the site of the Argentine Association of Polo, you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there. It is in front of the FIC West store, in Stanley.
Sterling is generally accepted in any place within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There is a good chance that credit cards will not be accepted on the islands of the periphery, but you may be able to use British or American money. Ask in advance with the owners to be able to define which method of payment is accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so it is advisable to do so before leaving.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30°C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: while it is very rare for temperatures to fall below the point of freezing, wind and humidity interact to make it feel even colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild life is still wild, so don't feed it and don't get in its way.
