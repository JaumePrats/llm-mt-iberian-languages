The Members of the Assembly (AM, for short) of Wales are concerned that they will appear to be "muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are bemused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for short).
This confusion arose from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the House from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Member of the House of Commons declared that his group was concerned that it would be "Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
One Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that his group was "disaffected" and has suggested alternatives.
A Conservative member of the Welsh Assembly said that his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the leap from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
The 2017 Act of the Welsh Government gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed widespread support for a Welsh Parliament in the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but MWP was the most popular option in a public consultation.
The Members of the Assembly are suggesting alternatives, but the fight for consensus could be a headache for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who would have to send the bill for the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the operation of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
The Members of the Assembly will have the final word on how they should be called when they decide on the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote in a referendum on the country's name change
The voters will decide on Sunday whether the name of their country will be changed to “Republic of Northern Macedonia.”
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the country neighbour, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent for the difficulties of Harlem churches
Historically, the people I have spoken to say that there was a pub and a church on every corner.
There is no longer any question of either/or.
He said that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
People now socialise in different ways.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods to which people go regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "eventually, they will come back to square one."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who would not help the shelters that remain in the neighbourhood.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, and they will therefore accelerate the closing of these churches, as it is unlikely that the vast majority of people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the AME Church in 1870 and St. Martin in 1880.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped there acquired the building.
A black congregation took over the leadership of St. Martin's, under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were resisting the hiring or promotion of blacks.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building and, while the congregation was planning for its reconstruction, they also ordered the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martín, called it "the poor man's campaigns."
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church carillon 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martín did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the diocesan leadership.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese "attempted to pass the costs" to the parish board, although the board had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiger shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for abalone in California
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for abalone in California on the first day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, so he swam over with a group to rescue him.
Hammel commented that he initially thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then realized he was screaming because he had been bitten.
Hammel noted that the boy had a broken collarbone.
“I shouted to all of them to get out of the water because there was a shark,” he added.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area some weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours for security and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's beauty plans drive the United Kingdom's beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist employees in their aisles and beauty halls.
In order to significantly boost the UK's beauty market, valued at 2.8 trillion pounds and growing at a rate faster than the decline in fashion and homeware sales, the UK's largest beauty halls will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space on shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's declared that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique range with a majority of products that are animal-friendly, something that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second of which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift towards daily small purchases in local shops force supermarkets to work harder to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that the chain's stores will look more like shopping malls as it tries to compete with discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat outlets since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is believed that this has boosted food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over how to split the profits from the Boots pharmacies in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of 281 Sainsbury's pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is reported to be participating in the scheme, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in a dedicated team of staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to meet all needs, and an attractive environment and a comfortable location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is “furious” after Holly Willoughby breaks a deal worth £11 million
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, was "furious" after the television presenter Holly Willoughby broke an agreement worth £11 million with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the fashion and accessories business and Truly.
This business had compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby, 37, announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks &amp; Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the girl from the television show admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for her Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting at the head office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday.
The business had been compared to Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow and was set to double Willoughby's fortune of £11 million.
While Willoughby, aged 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain for one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Truly, it was Holly's main priority.
It was to be her long-term future, which would keep her in the next two decades.
Its decision to abandon the project left everyone involved completely stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold.
The experts believe that the departure of This Morning's presenter, one of Britain's most lucrative stars, could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment in products from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly delay its launch further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for the past 10 years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, who is 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on holiday together and Jones has a 40 % share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become the face of Marks &amp; Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that “no business was discussed last night.”
A difficult conversation &quot;and then we fell in love &quot;
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some might consider 'not presidential' and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his mock-newsman voice.
“I have not given up anything.”
Kim said he was interested in meeting Trump after Trump praised the first meeting held in Singapore in June as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for the denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the North Korean chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an "adequate response" from the United States to its first steps towards North Korea's denuclearization.
The United States, on the other hand, continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in his speech.
We get on well with North Korea.
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a fantastic relationship now.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: the end of missile tests, aid for the release of hostages and bringing the remains of American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
It is very easy to be president, but instead of 10 000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we would have 200 people here, he said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for international aid to be mobilized.
It is regrettable that in many cases they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a little.
Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palu, but they are still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations would be allowed to provide assistance.
Given that the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still woefully unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami sirens in Palu, even though there was an early warning, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, travelling from one island of Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate the logistics.
A hospital ship that was on its way to Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake was heading for Palu, but it would take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is facing re-election next year.
It must also contend with the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, equals the mark against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just outside the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot before striking it.
The action sent it over the area and into the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga's head and he tried to catch it with a leap and fell into the net.
He was trying to get into that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible.
I saw Kante coming and gave him a nudge. I didn't think about it too much, I just fired the shot.
Chelsea was winning 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues's mediapunta was a pass to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before he turned and played a ball into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle.
After that, he made a nice pass to Hazard in the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and he finished off the attack with a left footed shot that Alisson Becker, from Liverpool, could not stop.
Liverpool plays Napoli on Wednesday, 15:00, in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday, which sent waves up to six metres high, according to the spokesman of the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested by the police as a suspect in the murder of a woman who was stabbed to death.
An investigation into murder has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed to death in John Street, in the early hours of 7:55 on 22 November, and a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
I would also recommend to any person, especially to taxi drivers, who may have been able to capture something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A spokesman for the police has confirmed that the body found is that of a woman from Birkenhead and that it was found on a property.
Some people who claim to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to find out where she had been this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have informed the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that nobody can enter or leave the building.
He was left flabbergasted when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now being informed that they will be allowed to return in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
He keeps repeating "it is terrible."
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon controlling the floor block.
Any person with information is requested to send an e-mail to DM @MerPolCC, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or register 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the last commemorative success with “rewriting history”
Its prohibition would be a poetic act of justice for this destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England by its puritanical fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestions of Mr Crick as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure from the Palace of Westminster would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
It may be that the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a testimony to the opinion of the nineteenth century and to the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As The Sunday Telegraph reported, 'Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more in the late 19th century than at any other time, a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case the monarchy.
If the description is completely accurate, then the debate continues.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure that represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of commemoration and celebration.
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a livestock dealer at a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery severed and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui county, Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 cows at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a pigsty was open.
He said that there was a great pig in the sty with blood on its snout.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
The legs of my cousin were bloodied and broken, he said, to The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
It appears that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although pigs are not known to attack people, it is not the first time that a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it off.
After a herd of pigs in Oregon ate a farmer in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious - their intention is not to do harm.
What is needed is to have the appropriate respect for them.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rain across the south-west of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern Mexican coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains in the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa produced winds of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday morning (Eastern time) to 5 a.m. on Monday, and was located about 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific, a low pressure system is moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States, bringing heavy rain to Baja California on Monday.
Rosa will leave more than 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain meets the low pressure system that is approaching, there will be heavy rain in the south-west for the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation rates of 5 to 8 cm per hour in specific areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the south-west, especially in most of Arizona.
Because of the nature of tropical rain, sudden and rapid flooding is possible.
In view of the threat of tropical downpours, it is not recommended to walk in the desert.
Heavy rains could turn the guns into rivers and storms into gales and local dust storms.
The approaching low pressure system will bring heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
The rain may leave as much as two centimetres of water, which could cause small streams and make the roads slippery.
It would be the first heavy rains of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before becoming widespread by late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes will be observed in the United States as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
Sometimes, this means drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences will be seen in the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and, Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the coming days, the prolonged heat of the summer will attempt to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures generally in the 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures could reach 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony.
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television channels on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued and the media interrupted their regular programming to report the latest developments of the Friday agreement: a deal designed by Arizona senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while she was drunk and that he tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his impassioned testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely certain that that had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who saw Nielsen on Friday will have seen it.
The company counted the audience ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels that carried the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen often has problems in calculating how many people see something in the office.
For perspective, it is a hearing similar to a football playoff or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, was the most-watched cable news channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and the CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
Following the hearing, there was a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the cameras of CNN and CBS caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing.
While receiving these criticisms, he was being broadcast live on CNN.
A woman looked me straight in the face.
“Are you telling the truth to the country?”
He continued: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a press release and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say in his testimony to the Commission.
Cable and broadcast television aired everything live hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to nominate Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate during the next week, which had been requested by some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The decision by Flake was critical, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
Theresa May, the Prime Minister, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, is due to arrive at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his own on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to pay the other's tariffs was "completely absurd."
Wayde murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say that he admitted to having shot Wayde.
A bond of USD 350 000 has been set, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head that had entered the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the police force in the area for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade declared that his team is "devastated" and "shocked" by the death of Wayde.
These are the things that people always worry about, said Wade.
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighbourhoods of Mexico City.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed activity and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The centre has experienced several earthquakes and tremors.
In social media, images showed layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
The police face separatist Catalans before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after anti-riot police clashed with demonstrators during a pro-independence march on the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarised referendum on secession.
A group of masked protesters, who had been blocked by the police, threw eggs and dust at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in the hours that followed and the police used truncheons to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with messages like "no forgiveness, no forgetting," faced off against unionist demonstrators who shouted "Viva España."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the 1 October referendum, which was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatists.
The voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the turnout was low, as those opposed to secession boycotted the referendum in large numbers.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, where there were violent clashes.
The groups in favour of independence camped out on Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said that he had no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year was one of our best years.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck.
Although the pro-Catalan parties won a narrow victory in the regional elections in December, they have struggled to retain the momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
The situation is becoming increasingly tense, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
Running for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government.
Londonderry: men arrested for driving into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly crashing a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday evening at 19:30 on Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that the accesses and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, the car may have been shot at with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gave Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers.
The first goal by Dolly Menga for Livingston secured the victory
A Livingston promoted impressed the Rangers by securing the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of Rangers.
The attack of Dolly Menga made the difference. The Gary Holt attack was the difference.
This season, Gerrard have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table by eight points.
Previously, Rangers received Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
While Livingston extended its winning streak to six games, Holt, the head coach, has yet to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses a golden opportunity to impress a visitor.
The Holt team had to be one step ahead much earlier than they were, causing all sorts of problems for Rangers by playing direct.
Scott Robinson beat the defence, but his shot went wide at the keeper, and then Alan Lithgow missed the target after coming inside for a shot at goal.
The host team would let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems with the ball-in-the-net.
It was a decisive blow.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an opening, with a combination of Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who struck the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that time Rangers dominated possession but could not break down the home defence and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper, was quite comfortable.
That game continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stoppage of play.
Allan McGregor, Rangers' goalkeeper, blocked a shot from Scott Pittman with his foot, and Livingston missed another chance.
In the Livingston area, long passes were regularly cleared, but two penalty claims were turned down, one after a Halkett run on the substitute Glenn Middleton and one after a hand.
Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A fantastic performance and result for Livingston.
The consensus is that they played a superb game that exceeded expectations of an upward trajectory.
Its style of play and its personnel have hardly changed since his arrival, but this is largely due to Holt's influence on the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was huge and led a magnificently organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good moments with Gerrard, they were short-lived.
They lacked the ability to execute the plays, only managing to get into the Rangers' half once, which is a call to arms for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received a mixed welcome in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies at breakfast for the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin on Saturday, 29 September.
It was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police cited security concerns to prevent 25 000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathisers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also spoke out against both his policies and the decision of the German government to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist killed after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has been killed in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, heading east towards the city, at 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended to by the paramedics, but he died there and then.
The accident occurred after another cyclist was killed after being hit by a vehicle that drove off in Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the site of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been blocked and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured after disturbances
Six prison officers have been injured in a brawl in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison directorate.
The disturbances began at Long Lartin prison, in Worcestershire, at 9.30 a.m. on Sunday and are still continuing.
A specialist team from the "Tornado" elite squadron (eight members) is dealing with the disturbances, involving eight inmates and affecting one wing.
The agents received assistance for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: "Specialist staff from the prison service have been deployed to deal with the incident at Long Lartin prison.
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence and make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in prison.
Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, prison officers were called in to deal with a serious disturbance in which inmates attacked prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep through the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona, southern Nevada and eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind on Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of rain, with up to 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be 2-5 mm, with 10 mm in isolated areas, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places where there is no risk of flash floods, Rosa's rains are a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although an inundation is a very serious matter, part of these torrential rains may be beneficial due to the current drought conditions in the south-west.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 % of Arizona is suffering from extreme or worse drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which is still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moving north at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is losing strength in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
It is expected that it will hit Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm along the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
Heavy rains of 7 to 15 cm are expected from Baja California to Sonora, with the possibility of 25 cm in some areas, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning.
The main danger to Rosa or its remains is heavy rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora and south-west Arizona.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and mudslides in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested as suspects in a stabbing attempt after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, at around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was moved to a hospital, where he is &quot; stable &quot;.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and the anger” of the Democratic Party
Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the vicious and unfair tactics of the Democrat Party, Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has “suffered through the meanness and the anger of the Democrat Party” throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, "Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most successful legalists of our time, a jurist with an admirable record of public service.
The president made indirect references to the candidacy of Kavanaugh to the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
There are five weeks to go to one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not standing for election, but I am a candidate.
That is why I go from one place to another, trying to find great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats are embarked on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the enormous waves that battered the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in Palu city for a festival on Friday night when waves as high as six metres came ashore, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When a tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately evacuate, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, everything on land, said Nugroho.
He added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, bridges torn down and mosques collapsed.
The shells continued to pound the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The BPPT, in a press release, reported that the energy released by the earthquake was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is situated at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
He said that bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the buildings that had been destroyed.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were completely down and there was no information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300 000 people live in the area, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
The agency was heavily criticised for failing to inform of the tsunami that hit Palu, although the agency claims that the waves had already reached the coast by the time the alert was issued.
In a recording made by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard warning people on the street below that a tsunami is approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout in the area around Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The airport in the city has been reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a visit scheduled to the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
That is a very bad thing.
Although the World Vision staff in Donggala have arrived safely in Palu, where they are sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating scene on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
He said that he had seen many houses destroyed.
That is a very bad thing.
While the aid groups were getting the wheels of assistance in motion, some people were complaining that the movement of experienced aid workers to Palu was being blocked.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign funding, supplies and personnel can be used if the site is declared a national disaster area.
And that has not yet happened.
A catastrophe at the provincial level, commented Aulia Arriani, a Red Cross spokesperson in Indonesia.
As soon as the Government says that it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but it has not happened yet.
As the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday passed, friends and family of the people still missing still had hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolate stories that natural disasters write.
A small child was pulled from a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, the instructor of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had been held earlier that month in Indonesia.
Some of the students who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“Based on my experience in the world of paragliding, I carry my own emotional baggage,” he said.
Mr Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were taking part in the beach festival.
However, its messages only showed a grey mark of verification, not two blue ones.
I believe that means that the messages were not delivered.
Thieves stole $26,750 from an automated teller machine at Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, a Brink employee was robbed of $26,750 from an automated teller machine at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a cash machine located in the leisure centre and was preparing to refill it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was occupied, another man “came running up behind the employee of Brink” and stole a bag of money destined for reloading.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information on their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West will start to be called Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, who is 41, has been known as Ye for some time now, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
In place of the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the creator of the show commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had said previously that the word had a religious importance for him.
I think it is the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West commented earlier this year while talking about the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, means we.
It was originally called Kanye, which means 'the only one', but it became Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capitals or lower case, with or without guion.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the Mexican president-elect, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people at a time when the student movements of the left were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing them with monthly stipends to study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I. A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by several parts of the US Government, including when the US does not have an official I. A. strategy.
While China presented its plan last year: its target is to become the number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
Doubling the budget for I. A. research would be a good start, given that all the other countries are lagging behind the United States, says Lee.
Double the funding means double the chances of the next great breakthrough in the U.S., as Lee declared in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important I. A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system that defeated the best American player of Othello. Subsequently, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
He gave recognition to previous competitions of the United States Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers have to work hard to get government grants, Lee commented.
It is not China that is taking the leaders away; it is the corporations.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent academics to work in I. A.
Lee commented that changes in US migration policy could also help to intensify US efforts in I. A.
I think that doctors in I. A. should be given permanent residence cards automatically.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals from academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee commented.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, whose purpose is to attract partners from industry and academia. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a new AI initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than 100 million USD per year in I. A. research.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation that created a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change the name of their country.
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday to change their name to "Republic of Macedonia of the North," a move that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its candidacy for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the new proposed name, but the nationalist opponents maintain that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Slav population, the majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50 % required to make the referendum valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies like the EU and NATO.
I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, to live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote as decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared that, at 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, voter turnout was only 16 %, compared with 34 % in the last elections to the Parliament in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their vote.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopie.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents of those who were boycotting the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not by the back door.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
The Prime Minister Zaev says that joining NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, with an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
I believe that the great majority will be in favour, as more than 80 % of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO.
He said that a positive result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Studies suggested that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which would be lower than the required turnout.
Another poll by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57 % of those polled intended to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 % said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50 % plus one.
If it fails, it will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, evades the whole Brighton defence to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling both scored in Manchester City's 2-0 win over Brighton on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentinean midfielder received a yellow card in the middle of the first half.
It ran between three defences of Brighton before breaking out into open country.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded a defender before outrunning several more in the Brighton area.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch to return the ball to Agüero, who struck it with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan with a shot that went to the right side of the net.
“Agüero has some problems with his foot,” said Pep Guardiola, City's manager, to the journalists.
We are talking about 55 to 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky to score at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave Sky Blue the initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton goal.
He made a lovely pass to Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane gave some touches before directing Sterling towards the second mast.
The Sky Blues striker lobbed the ball just inside the offside line.
The City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday, 12:55 p.m. CET at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the party for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff, there was no reason to force another opening.
However, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can go out there with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be into it and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level that I have faced this year.
Why should he not want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it seems they are leaning towards leaving Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who will make his debut at number 34, will be practising on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 appearances.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation, his nomination to the Supreme Court, in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
In November everything we have done is at stake.
There are five weeks to go to one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I am not standing, but I am fighting for great candidates, and I am going from one place to another.
He continued: "We have this terrible group of radical democrats, they are now in power.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, and they are showing themselves to be petty and mean.
They do not care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control.
The Democrats, he said, were embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
“We have seen it these last four days,” he said, saying that the Democrats “were furious, were bad, were horrible and were false.”
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the Senate by nominating Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his reply?
Please filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, ¿qué?
No, no mmm, I hope for a reply. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.
The Labour Party now covers a wide spectrum of opinion.
Luxembourg is intolerant of people who speak their mind.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are told that they are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My hon. Friend Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way for being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He was at odds with the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. It is ironic that he was at odds with leaders on both sides.
As the Labour Party's Nottingham East branch notice of meeting on Friday stated, "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more compassionate and kind" policy has long since been forgotten, if it was ever applied at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began little more than a year after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to change his mind and take positions with which he would never have been comfortable, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced this.
I am indeed fortunate to be more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every motion for censure or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice to keep my head down and not make a fuss, and that I would be better off.
I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, I have been motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my secondary school building literally in ruins, to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my political views, and I have never hidden them in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
I would say to those who promoted the Friday motion that I do not understand these people's desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not to Momentum, but to the electorate, be they Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will stop me acting in what I believe to be best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an Ayr unbeaten rises to the top
Two late tries may have decided the final outcome, but Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superior defence and ability to make the most of opportunities that gave the local team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
“We have been tested in all directions and we have come out victorious, so I am happy.”
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: "The Ayr deserves the recognition, they took the opportunities better than us."
The essay by Grant Anderson at the 14-minute mark, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, on loan from Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opposition and Jason Baggot managed to convert the penalty.
Ayr extended their lead with a penalty kick just before half-time, which turned the score into 17-5 in their favour.
However, the Melrose started well the second half and the essay by Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
There was a long break after Ruaridh Knott was carried off the field with a serious injury, and when play resumed, Ayr took the lead with a try by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the fact that they had one more man with a Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for pleasing Climo without the ball, from the line of scrimmage, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
The weather, as it had done almost since the game had restarted, after Kyle Rowe had received the ball from David Armstrong and kicked it into the corner for Gregor Henry to win the fifth penalty for the locals.
The Still Game character wants to move into the catering business
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the catering business after being appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor is Jack Jarvis, who is 56 years old and is the writer and co-star of the famous BBC programme with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “booming Glasgow restaurant scene.”
“The sea is ours”: a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
The blue flag flies over public buildings.
From the Titicaca Lake to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea is ours by right,
It is a duty to recover it.
In Bolivia, a land without a sea, the memory of the lost coast, which was fought over in a bloody conflict for the resources that it had in the nineteenth century, is still vivid.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and calm and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision, &quot; commented Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate for Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is locked in a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution on Monday.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favour and that the situation would not change much if it did.
The UN agency in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's ruling came only six months after the final arguments indicated that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
The problem of access to the sea has been seized upon by the current Bolivian administration.
He also suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to continue the conversation after this.
The two countries do not have ambassadors since 1962.
The former President of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who was representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court was unusually quick to make decisions.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "put an end to 139 years of mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political football.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access to the Pacific Ocean.
The resolution is an opportunity to look to the future.
North Korea says it will not give up its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, says that his nation will never be the first to give up nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honour the pledges made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume nuclear talks with North Korea, which have been stalled for more than three months.
Ri points out that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korean War to subject the North is a "fantasy."
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without some meaningful disarmament movement from Pyongyang.
Kim and the US president, Donald Trump, want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's renunciation of an arsenal that the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the mandarins.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of enormous hats that are about to land in a shop near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring/summer 2019 show on the Paris Fashion Week runway, dazzling the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other accessories included a pineapple, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of outrageous masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-on lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation recalled a full diving team, including snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you are in luck.
Hunters of style predict that the enormous hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
The big hats are back, thanks to "La Bomba", with a wide-brimmed hat with a 60 cm brim, worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of cult following this impractical hat flooded social media also presented another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini.
The orange-brown raffia bag, decorated with white leather straps, was the main piece of the La Riviera collection by Jacquemus for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets. Since the designer has had such a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: linguistic skills are essential for citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have a long history of academic excellence, which has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the examinations, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30 000 pupils in Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for short), strive to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they will occupy in the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a curriculum adapted to the modern languages, it is observed that modern languages are still popular and desired in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he will listen to you.
If you speak to them in their language, you reach their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if one wants to establish relations and build trust with people from other countries, one cannot rely solely on English.
If we look at the results of the recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
Overall, 68% of pupils who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centres that make up the SCIS, showed that 72 % of the students achieved an A in Mandarin, 72 % in German, 69 % in French and 63 % in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that children and young people will need in the future without a doubt.
Languages are now considered to be on a par with the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, of the reasons given by employers for difficulties in filling jobs, 17 % were attributed to a lack of language skills.
The linguistic skills are therefore becoming more and more indispensable for preparing young people for their future careers.
The opportunities for employment that require language skills are increasing, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he or she has learned a second language, he or she will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a skill like this, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will give that person an automatic advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 % of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and 15 % spoke only French.
Investing in language education is therefore important for today's children.
If children know several languages, especially those of developing economies, they will be better equipped to have better job opportunities.
In Scotland, different colleges will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child's interests, in independent schools he or she can choose from a range of languages taught by specialist staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing an environment of learning that prepares children for life and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future holds.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages still have a vital role to play in the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered "competences for international communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
One must make allowances for the fact that it is a small country.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent College Council.
LeBron James makes his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait for LeBron James to make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' head coach, has announced that James will play in the season opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is still not known how many minutes the match will last.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton commented on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James would likely play a few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
In this stage of my career I do not need pre-season friendlies to prepare myself.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled by Trump for next week, including stops in places with supporters, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his nominee to the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 this Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch it online via a live YouTube broadcast.
It is likely that Trump will comment on the Kavanaugh hearings this week, which were marred by allegations of sexual misconduct and have left a Senate confirmation vote on the horizon for at most a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans who are facing the November elections to gain momentum.
The five rallies that President Trump is holding next week are intended to "energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House," according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so crucial to their agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the campaign, said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named.
The event scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage in Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday visit will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
For Morrisey, it is not good news that the president has to come and push him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows that it is prepared to fight to keep the flame of hope alive for the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needs.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept in sport, but the players believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
Where is the impulse now?
We were six points ahead and now we are four points behind, so I guess that is a little momentum.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points for twelve more.
As Spieth points out, the Americans have a lot going for them and plenty of reasons to be cheerful, not least the fact that Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day and managed to score three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and preaches by example.
The guttural cries of celebration rose in volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt for the match to level the fourth when he and Thomas were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the win in the 15 was greeted with a similar cry, one that suggested that the American team was not yet out of it.
What is needed is to redouble efforts and concentrate on the party.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes for the ball to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe have won four of four and nothing can go wrong.
Moliwood was the only pair to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
The fact that they have won the last two majors and that they have won the last two Ryder Cups is a clear indication that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
It is preferable to have two different holes in the ground.
However, it is still too early to talk of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio García, the hero of the four-ball playoff, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two birdies on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
However, there will be no help on Sundays to get out of the holes.
The foursomes and fourballs are fascinating to watch because of the interplay between the partners, the advice given and not given, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team and has a big advantage going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team is not afraid to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good lead going into the final day of the Ryder Cup, after winning foursomes and fourballs 10-6 over the United States.
The duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over Tiger Woods, who was in trouble, gaining four points in the Le Golf National standings.
Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many errors during the foursomes in the morning, which ended 3-1.
The United States won two foursomes matches, but did not manage to close the gap.
The American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first rookie to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership served to beat a despondent Woods and the American rookie Bryson DeChambeau by a convincing 5-4.
Woods, who has not been a regular feature in either team on Saturday, has had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 foursomes and fourballs, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the foursomes in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and number three players respectively, 2-1.
Although the weather was pleasant and calm in the south-west of Paris, Europe was not having a good day.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference point for the Americans, who earned two points on Saturday.
They won a thrilling victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has ever recovered from a four-point deficit in the individual matches, but Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to retain it.
Although they were the second best for two days, it seems that a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is no chance of it unilaterally disarming first if it does not have confidence.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of its unilateral renunciation of nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
North Korea declared to the General Assembly of the international agency that it had adopted "important good-will measures" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing itself to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances there is no possibility of us unilaterally disarming.
Although Ri repeated the well-known complaints of North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the formal end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can be formally declared at an end.
Washington has resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament first and has increased the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose by force, even objecting to a declaration of the end of the war.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall to our knees is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our distrust.
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the US leader at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri's tone was radically different from last year's speech to the UN General Assembly, when he said that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles towards US soil after "malignant" Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim "rocket man".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and that sanctions needed to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can do it in two years, three years, five years, who knows?"
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its progress.
As US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, "The sanctions of the Security Council must be vigorously and fully implemented until we achieve the final, fully verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off the funding of its ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and commented that he would be back in Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had been progress, but a few hours later, North Korea denounced its "demands as those of a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied “corresponding measures.”
He said that Kim had told him that the “measures” he was seeking were the security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep
Thanks to a new course that is being taught this year at Harvard University, all students are now sleeping more in an attempt to fight the growing culture of all-night studying with caffeine.
A professor discovered that students at the world's top university often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The motivation for starting the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was only finding out about this now, in her final year.
He said that nobody had ever spoken to him about the importance of dreams, which surprised me.
The course, which was introduced this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only a few hours a week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After that, an icon of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that students will not change their behaviour overnight.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as everyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco.
He said that the culture of "pulling an all-nighter" still existed and added that modern technology and the pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good night's sleep should be the'secret weapon' of students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar programme of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by screens and LED lights, which can disrupt circadian rhythms, and thus have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another home defeat, when the attack of Dolly Menga saw the disjointed team of Steven Gerrard lose 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to get their first away win since February's 4-1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team got their second win in 18 games as manager, leaving their team eight points behind Hearts, who are now top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
The Menga attack came just minutes before half-time and Rangers' poor shape was never going to be enough.
Now Rangers drop to sixth, Livingston to third, behind Hibs by the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after allegedly being hit by an object from the visiting side.
Gerrard switched to eight of the eight players who won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt took the 11 Livingston players who beat Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organised team suffocated their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when he had it.
They should have marked the two minutes of the beginning, when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman that went between the defence, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent it out.
Keaghan Jacobs took a shot at the captain, Craig Halket, but his partner in defence, Alan Lithgow, could only get it out by the long pole.
The Rangers recovered the control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored his request.
The Rangers had two chances in the first half, but the old Ibrox keeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute was a surprise, nobody can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, Rangers failed to cope with a deep ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to score.
In the rest, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the ball was played to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block it.
However, Livingston continued to lead the visitors exactly to the type of game he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing a long passage after another.
The Holt boys could have made more of an impact in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow finished a head-on that didn't enter.
The Rangers substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the “Sunday Morning”: 30 September 1882, and counting... the future physical chemist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The chemist Geiger, who since then has been a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Singing Hills," with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was 63 years old.
The invention that bears his name is still alive and well.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” a common protein in many cancers and re-target them.
A vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory to "see" a common protein called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, as explained by Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West went on a rant in favour of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It did not go well.
Kanye West was booed off stage at Saturday Night Live after a performance in which he praised the US president, Donald Trump, and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often speak to someone white and they ask me how I can like Trump if he is racist.
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago.
SNL started the program with a sketch of Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee testimony regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of the incident was not broadcast, Chris Rock posted the video of the incident on his social media.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
West also said that he had had a hard time on the set because of the hat.
They messed with me.
They told me not to go out with my hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they say I am asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "I'm so tired I could sleep standing up."
Try with love.
His comments were booed by the audience on at least two occasions and the members of SNL appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety.
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West shocked many when he came out on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the leader of the TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
I decide not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I consider is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We also have a long history, but our independence dates from 1839.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been known as Snoop Lion, and the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The Fiscal Office will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Nieve in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31 years old, has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that those roles in film often transmitted to young men that they had to be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he thinks it &quot; quite important &quot; to address this issue.
I think it is important that we get this right at this point in time, 'Where have we gone wrong with masculinity?'
What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they now face?
Kit believes that television can have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male-dominated characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on television and in the street that makes young people feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with the education of young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any spin-offs or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "sick of battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he got out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so in that sense it gave me my future family and my life from now on.
Rose was Ygritte, the object of Kit, Jon Snow's, affection in the fantasy series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at a Leslie family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 % more new cases
China has announced a 14 % increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820 000 people affected, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40 000 new cases were reported.
The majority of these were infected sexually, which is a change from the past.
HIV traditionally spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced to a small number, as the Chinese health authorities declared at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100 000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community faces much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have calculated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with men will end up marrying women.
Many of the diseases are transmitted by not using adequate protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked information to Republican senators and calls the allegations "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three United States Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles said that the allegations were being pushed by commentators and websites on the "far right."
“Lies, lies and more lies,” said Waters on Twitter.
The information published included the addresses and telephone numbers of the United States senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted information on the Internet during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identified the origin of the postings was associated with the Waters office, and they made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie, continued Waters.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not responsible for the leak.
This allegation is completely unfounded and a complete lie.
The declaration of Waters was immediately criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer refutes this information with anger.
This suggests that the necessary temperance for membership of the Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
One must not rebel.
The prosecutor must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must maintain calm and serenity.
It seems that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of seeming too angry during his Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If that is true, it is very serious.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations.”
We will ensure that the authors are identified and held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against my staff.
Johnny English: The Spy Next Door is a poor man's spoof of James Bond.
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new film with a British slant. It seems that this is what to do with this new Johnny English franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-deprecation about how clearly ridiculous we are be the new opportunity for export?
The incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his licence to make a fool of himself for a second time.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that sort of thing that touched on the theme of Carros de fuego that was touched on at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
It was originally based on the mysterious man traveller and international represented years ago by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television adverts, causing chaos in its wake.
There are a couple of good moments in this last episode.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval suit of armour while the rotors were smashing into the hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humour is somewhat lacking and is superfluous, especially now that franchises such as 007 and Mission: Impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
The humour seems to be aimed at children rather than adults and, for me, the absurd mishaps of Johnny English are not as clever and as well-timed as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
The repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all their active agents to the consternation of the agent on duty, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
The Prime Minister is a pompous and cornered figure, and Emma Thompson gives a good performance as a politician who is seeing her popularity sink: she is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not give her much room to work.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are at risk, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That must be Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh school, although he also gives extra-curricular lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy school like James Bond.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old pal Bough, represented once again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submariner, a role he plays too infrequently for Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of Her Majesty return to action, with the beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
While the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous garrisons of a charismatic multi-millionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; and English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarise himself with the interior of the house of Volta.
The final sequence was definitely well-used, but the whole thing still has a rather childish feel to it.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I could not help wondering if the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan to have Britons working four days a week, but receiving five days' pay.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to think of a radical plan with which Britons would work four days a week, but would be paid for five.
The party wants the owners of companies to set aside the savings made from the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) for the workers, giving them an extra day off.
The employees would thus enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea "would fit" into the party's economic plans and agenda.
This change to a four-day week has the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As one senior Labour Party figure commented to The Sunday Times: A review of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
The four-day week is a question which the party will definitely be pursuing in the future, and it is a question which will be incorporated into the party's general industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this type of idea, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at present, not all Labour MPs support this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day week is not part of the party's policy and will not be discussed at this stage."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was prepared to take back powers from "shadow directors" and "cronies" of public utilities.
One of the minister's shadow plans is to ensure that the current shareholders in the water companies do not get their full share back, as a Labour government could apply deductions to cover the irregularities.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive funds in which 10 % of shares in private companies would be set aside for employees, with dividends of up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court judge by at least a week and raises the question of whether the results could influence any Republican senator who might ultimately decide to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could produce information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
Of course, said Kennedy.
I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, after the allegation had come out, and I asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, determined."
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
No one of the persons named by her has been able to confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive roster of stars in support of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather on the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively engaged in fighting it.
If you want to get a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), you have to complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other thing that helps raise awareness about your goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of reaching its goal?
The idea of rewarding with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to take action or not, is it not just a form of "clicktivism," which is the term we use when we think we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in support of a wide range of objectives.
Thanks to these actions, world leaders have announced commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from its actions, of which 10 billion dollars have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced almost 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition," a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom, which is united by a common commitment to "help children grow and reach their full potential." To this end, it has proposed to provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda following more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
Thanks to the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for "The Power of Nutrition," to a crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen contributor responded: "It will be a long and hard road and, in many cases, we will stumble and fall.
As we have already succeeded in the past in movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will succeed together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will have at the New York event this year, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of energy exports from Russia - Department of the Interior
In case of need, Washington could call on its Navy to stop Russian energy from shaking the Middle East markets, as revealed by the Secretary of the Interior of the United States, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the alliance between Russia and Syria, in particular where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is no more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier of the south of Europe."
Furthermore, according to official information, there are ways and means of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to guarantee that shipping lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as "the consumer voice in energy policy."
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The alternative economic option in Iran and Russia is, basically, to exploit and replace fuels," he warned, indicating that Russia knows only one thing, that is, to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made at a time when the Trump administration has been trying to push its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to take the wind out of Russia's sails, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
The Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, is trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted on the Nord Stream 2 project, which is worth 11 billion dollars and is intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, being purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends its fierce opposition to the project as being motivated solely by economic considerations and is a further example of unfair competition.
I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The United States position has been met with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry association BDI has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a major problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will consider running for president in 2020, she said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a visit to the Holyoke, Massachusetts, City Hall, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being addressed.
It is time for women to come to Washington to mend our fractured government and to finally have women in leadership," she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider standing for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a town hall and said he was "taking the country down the wrong path."
"I am really concerned about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke candidly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the election."
However, a majority of Warren voters themselves do not believe that he should run for re-election in 2020.
A 58 per cent of the "likely" voters in Massachusetts said that Senator Kerry should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Some 32 per cent of those surveyed supported his candidacy.
The poll showed a greater support for the previous governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for 2020 of the former vice-president Joe Biden and the senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke of Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
The situation that my son is going through, because of everything that has happened since he returned, is known very well by the other families that suffer the effects of the TEPT and other wounds that our soldiers return with, &quot; he said to the public that gathered in a rally in favour of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that nobody wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other veterans of war who "come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there is really that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a domestic violence complaint and possession of firearms under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy to the new policy of the United States which denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a "friendly" letter to Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum-seeker who is facing the current directive, according to NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" which was presented in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against the federal policy has not been revealed.
He said that his companion "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but the US officials denied her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers who represent these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum requests to the United States, as nations that face widespread problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in the US.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made statements on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to the Federal Asylum Act, all asylum applications must be decided on the facts and circumstances of the individual case and this exception to the principle is contrary to this.
The lawyers also noted in their brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is bad for the US economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide a needed workforce."
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to domestic violence and gang violence victims in June.
Asylum seekers may be granted asylum if they are persecuted or threatened because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said when he announced this directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, let alone all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to rescue in Palu as the death toll mounts in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly desperate.
The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in a relief centre in the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulances arrive every minute with more bodies.
The water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for whatever belongings they can salvage.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded; including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continued strong tremors.
He could not help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he had been through while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the rubble, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help and then a terrible silence.
I do not know what has happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well."
The US ambassador accuses China of bullying with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a four-page advertisement in a US newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China was published by a Chinese government newspaper, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most-read newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the US Congress elections on 6 November, something China denies vehemently.
The accusation that Beijing tried to influence the US elections marked a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led to increased tariff levels on both sides.
The Chinese countervailing duties that were initially applied to the United States in the early days of the trade war were designed to hit the states that supported the Republican Party of Donald Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China is "intensifying that pressure with advertisements in our free press."
The Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and press to try to place a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
In contrast, in the newsstand on the street where we are in Beijing, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China may have on the worrying trajectory that the economy of their country is taking, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party."
One of China's most influential newspapers had declined to publish the article, but he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts say that the Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are rallying behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash could occur, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and many republicans have expressed their desire to continue with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday that it was too late to turn back.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-ditch effort to position himself as a supporter of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm disgruntled voters on this issue.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget tomorrow, either," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, as reported by the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters outside the Senate chanted "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) as the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by the Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is off the charts," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, at the news site.
People say that the impact is already very significant and, indeed, it is.
However, it could be even higher, especially among indecisive women in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote, even though they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had warned that a confirmation hearing could backfire.
This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, as reported by NBC News.
It is not just a question of the committee vote and the final vote, nor even of whether they sit on the bench with Kavanaugh; it is also the way the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are fewer who are on the side of this latter.
In a new YouGov poll, 41% of respondents say they believe Ford's testimony definitively or probably, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh's testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while 30% said the same of Ford.
After the push by Flake, the FBI is now investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he was at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the legend of the technology. A company that is based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "to rule the world."
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses the technology of Solid to allow users to create their own "personal data locker" or POD.
It can contain lists, lists of tasks to be done, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique to online personal data storage is that the user is in complete control of who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal data training."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's chief executive officer, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers on staff who were working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce a radical change where all their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
We are not going to ask for permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web site created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even though Berners-Lee is launching Inrupt, he will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," he added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only English clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War was honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this medal on 29 September 1918 at the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a marksman shot him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren found a commemorative stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned it to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a dense fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and artillery."
He then ran the gauntlet and, with the greatest courage, made his way to a single gun and knocked out three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very inspiring."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is shown when he is given such a strong backing."
MMA fans stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 only to miss the main event.
The San José billboard had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was to be broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the United Kingdom's television viewers were stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were not surprised after having to stay up late to watch the fight.
One Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a joke gone too far."
There is a government regulation that governs what is broadcast from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when we asked him about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig", yes".
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they will be modifying the programme to include British viewers in future editions.
When I think of the option of the broadcast, I think it can work," said Coker.
However, it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are seeing how to do it.
When the programme was changed, we received a great deal of feedback, and not all of it was friendly.
We tried to sort it out, because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, it was a government problem.
I can promise that the next time it will not happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is the usual number we have had, so that the fans were happy and we were happy.
It is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic diver, says that he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but that was what motivated him to become a winner.
At 24, he told us that he did not realize until he got to secondary school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that her intention in talking about gay rights was to "give hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to put less importance on winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this mythical programme, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne, Daley, who was portrayed as a misfit, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest of his peers during his childhood, because "society did not accept liking boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, that sense of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," so he did not disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent face of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games held in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he told the story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass on that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion declared that for him it was a complete surprise to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married last year to an Oscar winner who is 20 years older, but he specified that the age difference had never been an issue.
When you live as long as I have, from such a young age, it is hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have been about 'I have to win a gold medal'."
But there are more important things than gold Olympic medals.
My gold medal from the Olympics is, without doubt, Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I was not able to tell him that I could not be in the first row.
He had his hand on my chest when he stopped breathing and it was only then that I realised that he was not invincible.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
I knew then that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to compete in the pool in front of my friends in the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This was also the inspiration for her first song, Proud, which she sang during the preparation for the Olympics.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to reverse his form if he is to avoid becoming a sad statistic.
Mickelson, who was playing in the event that is held every two years to break a record for 12 times, was beaten by Captain Furyk in the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the centre of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-times major champion had to be content with cheering on at times and, at others, trying to perfect his game in the field and thus be able to rectify what ails him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form for the Le Golf National, where the long rough punishes him continually with wayward shots.
And if the field is not sufficiently daunting, Mickelson, in the ninth round of the British Open, faces the brilliant champion of the Open, Francesco Molinari, who joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four rounds they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four shots behind after the first 12 individual matches, had started strongly, Mickelson's match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, he could say no more.
He understood perfectly the role he had to play today, patted me on the back and said he would be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given a lot to these teams over the years and this week.
I did not imagine that I would play two matches.
I thought there would be more, but that is how it turned out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them."
Mickelson will break the record of Nick Faldo for the most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a long line of Ryder Cups that never had such a clear individual mark.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, although Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He is fun, sarcastic, clever, he likes to mock others; he is a great guy to have on the team.
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as a support this week; it was fun.
It adds much more than just play."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although he has a substantial lead in the last days of the Ryder Cup, he can easily turn into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 Ryder Cup at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they managed to win by the narrowest of margins, 14½-13½.
Bjorn, pictured, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead by 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National, said, "We had a great tournament at Valderrama; we also had a great tournament at Brookline and we lost, we had a great tournament at Valderrama and we won, but by the skin of our teeth."
History will show that this team is not yet finished.
You have to give it your all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are in the marker.
We have a target to hit, and that is to win this trophy, and that is all we have to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on our 12 players, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where there are the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is important tomorrow is individual performance and this is different.
It is great to share what is happening with a partner when things are going well, but when things are not going well, you put your golfing skills to the test.
The message to the players is to give their best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner behind, go and get the best out of yourself."
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be looking to get his players to play better individually than they did as a pair, with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas the exceptions, who added three points to four.
Furyk has been on both sides of the fence in the last few days of these great tournaments and was part of the winning team at Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
He remembered every word, when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-major parties tomorrow, but we have to get off to a good start as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the field.
I chose this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole range of the trip," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German battleship, postponed again
The new German frigate was supposed to be ordered in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era vessels, but it will not be ordered until at least 2015 due to defective systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The handover of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a statement by the Die Zeit newspaper, quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the handover scuppered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships that the Navy is requesting in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and a few technologies of invisibility, such as radar, infra-red and acoustic signatures, which are very low.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, up to two years away from home ports.
However, the delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to enable Germany to project its power into the far reaches of the world) will already be out of date when they start to serve, as Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 was the subject of headlines last year when the German Navy officially rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return were not known, but German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the ship practically unusable for a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly serious, as the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of 120, half the number of personnel on the old Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons is twice as heavy as other similar German ships used in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the whole project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is now estimated at 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion).
The problems that are being attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction in the naval power of Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy was "running out of ships capable of deploying."
The officer said that the problem has been getting worse over the years, because the old ships have been decommissioned, but not replaced with new ones.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class ships had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, carried out in a Scottish Highlands state, aims to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that what is learned will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton's and brown long-eared bats from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in strategic locations on the property to monitor the activities of the bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The experts will analyse the sounds on the recordings to determine the frequency of the calls of the bats and the species that make them.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to give a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they use them.
The benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how to maintain forests for bats and other associated species, will be determined by this information.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affects their nesting and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and power cables can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemicals in building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind,
Because of their nocturnal habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in tracking down their prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocation to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescues.
The organization has also opened the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in Scotland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
However, there are still many things unknown about bats, and the work we do here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It is important to check for bats before carrying out maintenance work on the property, as a colony of bats can be destroyed unintentionally and 400 females and young could be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Murine bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, or disturb them, or to destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to get involved.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species on which we know little about their populations."
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations while his lawyers pursue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations as "fake news," and says that people are "trying to get their name out there" at his expense.
Luxembourg's lawyers have been instructed to denounce the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the statements.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping a woman from the United States, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of having been paid 375 000 $ to keep the incident secret, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already garnered 142 million followers hours after the news broke, Ronaldo, 33, called the report "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball, looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to make a name for themselves by mentioning me, but I can't help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," he added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they call "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, the lawyer, said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to Ronaldo's room and Ronaldo allegedly raped her, according to court documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga said that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was a "99 per cent" good boy and that he had let him down by the "one per cent" remaining.
In the documents it is stated that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "terrified of reprisals" and concerned about "being humiliated in public."
The woman, 34, is claiming that she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatised by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has changed to Juventus, a great club in Italian football, for a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: the United Kingdom would regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "regret it for the rest of its life" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.
He said it was "disconcerting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could result in the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Auris and Avensis Toyota cars, produced 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 per cent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a production bottleneck in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed their concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car industry are the problems that could arise in the event of a no-deal Brexit in the car industry.
The Toyota production system is based on the just-in-time (JIT) method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, there could be a disruption at the border that, according to the sector, could cause delays and the shortage of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to store the amount of material equivalent to more than a day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would have to be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, which sets out the future relationship with the EU, is "tuned precisely to avoid those checks at the border."
We need an agreement. We need to get the best deal that will not only get us through this moment but will take advantage of the opportunity.
Toyota, among others, have evidence that we need to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful supply chain."
Toyota has not been able to say how long it would stop production, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union rep at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "From my experience, once those jobs are lost, they are never recovered."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a clear and convincing plan for how we will shape our future relations with the EU."
The Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week, as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, links between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not and thus compromise the independence of Mueller has fuelled the gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein taped his conversations with Trump with a microphone he carried to try to get rid of the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House, where it was reported that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testifying.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, but this would delay the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, the press secretary for Trump, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be another, considering all that is going on with the Supreme Court."
We will decide on this as we go along and I will inform the press as I usually do.
Some journalists would dispute that assertion: Sanders has not done any White House press briefings since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the shortage of press coverage was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who act with grandiloquence, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they do grandiloquence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The President holds more question and answer sessions than any other President before him," he said, while citing without proof: "We have compared those numbers."
The press will continue to exist, said Sanders, but "if the press has the option of asking directly the President of the United States, I think that is much better than asking me."
We have tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump is known to respond to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
Indeed, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why he was so, where he made an unorthodox and sometimes bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish NHS workers are being written to by the Scottish Government's Health Secretary about their fears over Brexit.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working in the HSS of Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and its desire for them to stay with them post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of applications for citizenship for EU citizens working in public services that are not devolved to the Scottish Parliament.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the United Kingdom and the European Union have continued to negotiate the exit that was expected this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has also stepped up preparations in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know that all this must be very confusing for you.
I would like to reiterate here how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, of which patients and communities benefit.
Scotland is, of course, your home and we would love to continue to have you with us."
Christion Abercrombie is in urgent need of surgery after suffering a head wound.
Christion Abercrombie, a player for the Tennessee State Tigers, was taken to hospital for emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday, when the Tigers lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
The Tennessee State coach, Rod Reed, told the press that the injury occurred just before the break.
He came to the band and collapsed there.
Both the trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to the medical tent for a thorough examination.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operation.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury or the extent of the damage" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on the Saturday before leaving the field, with a total of 18 for the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher stamp duty when purchasing a property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to provide shelter for the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters.
The increase in the land tax will be payable by those who are not already paying taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to be spent on the homeless.
The extra money raised from the increase in stamp duty on foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May said today.
The measure is intended to neutralise the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his pledges to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to target those with higher incomes.
The increase in the land tax will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivise the government's policy to tackle begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current stamp duty, including the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, could reach up to 3 %.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of new-build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which causes prices to rise and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's most affluent areas (especially the capital) have become "ghost towns" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping land prices high by buying up land without any intention of building on it and urged Mrs. May to remove the "shameful" housing benefit to solve the "shameful" housing crisis in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means dealing with the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, should be able to buy houses more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult to reach for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland manager says his "primary objective" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The Scot, 42, is excited at the prospect of reviving the club from the north-east, which currently occupies third place in the League One (the third division of English football), three points behind the leader.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back into the Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
However, I only managed to get a B" hat, he told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a boy and it has always made me want to go back.
This opportunity will only become a reality if I manage to run a club successfully."
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The previous manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he took over from such established names in such a big club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League."
because the structure and facilities of this club correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
It is not easy to achieve, but I would consider myself successful only if I can return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after being an assistant at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the Hearts technical department.
He helped Alloa to recover from relegation to the Third Division and helped St. Mirren to win the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled in reference to when he took over Alloa.
I always thought that management was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, but I was good at it, I could make a living out of it and I enjoyed some great moments.
Playing can be very hard work.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that job; however, I feel well in the direction.
I have always wanted to train and now I have managed to do it, it is the time of my adult life in which I have felt better, without a doubt.
The interview can be heard on Sportsound on Monday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The heatwave of the summer has boosted sales in British pubs that are struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on the chains.
The number of pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7% in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8%, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have still kept the pattern of June, in which pubs increased their turnover by 2.8 per cent, if anything restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8% fall in the activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced their profits.
Pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered from the heat, although not as badly as restaurant operators.
It seems that people only want to go out to drink.
In bars and pubs, sales of drinks rose to 6.6 per cent during the month, while sales of meals fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, the RSM's leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and the impact of social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of sales in the market for leisure activities.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8% drop in sales in comparison with last year is going to be particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering industry and time will tell whether the cooler temperatures of August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in branded openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, data is collected and analysed from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £900 million and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media sites, away from their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret accounts on social media sites, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted among 20 000 secondary school pupils, revealed a growth in the number of fake Instagram pages.
The news has heightened fears that the content will be sexually explicit.
About 20% of pupils have a "main" account that they show to their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) have social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20 000 secondary school pupils revealed the rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears that the content will be sexually explicit.
Some 20% of pupils said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents, as well as other private accounts.
A mother who happened upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw an adolescent encouraging others to "rape" her.
The research, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged 11-18 had two profiles, and half admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as an executive director at the annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want to see sport benefit from her great experience at international level over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected in the whole Scottish and world athletics community, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from having her on board."
Doyle said: "I like to be the mouthpiece for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics between the four golds he won and is now a regular BBC expert, suffered a transient ischaemic attack which left him temporarily unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a brain haemorrhage.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I have now fully recovered and am now doing exercises to regain my agility.

The advertisement comparing mothers to cows in a sacaleches has divided opinion on the Internet.
A company selling breast pumps has divided opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing mothers who breastfeed to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is in theory the world's first silent breast pump, the consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with a bit of irony, showing mothers talking about the freedom that the new breast pump gives them.
Four queens dance in a hay barn, with letters like: "Yes, I do it myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, these aren't udders, they're breasts."
The chorus continues: "Cut them, cut them, I am feeding their babies, cut them, cut them, I am milking my women."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has created a great deal of controversy.
The video has received over 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, with many saying that it brings the "horrors" of the dairy industry to light.
A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
As with us, they have to be pregnant before they can produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after they have given birth.
The Elvie breastpump is discreetly concealed in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
One person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby."
Why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who do stay at home with their babies?"
One comment was: "What a ridiculous advertisement!"
However, other people defended the advertisement, including a woman who admitted that the song was “destructive.”
I think that is a great idea.
If it were still suckling, it would surely have one.
I felt like a cow when I used the bomb.
The advertisement is a bit over the top, but I don't want to get into that.
It is a wonderful product,” said one woman.
One person commented: "It is a funny advert aimed at mothers who use a breastpump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The dairy sector is not praised or condemned in the advertisement.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the breast, allowing women to move around, hold their babies and even go out into the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother's ECD, comments: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minors discreetly relocated to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied minors detained has increased significantly, despite the fact that the monthly inflow at the border has remained at the usual levels.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that their own stay in the country would be jeopardized by their proposal to take in a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be required to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at ICE, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
Around 80% of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
We are still pursuing these people,” said Albence.
In their rush to process juveniles more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from the time of arrest, as opposed to 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to the workers at the shelters.
Many will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered fit for the amparo will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reports from the centres and the system itself, the longer they are held in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Concerns are heightened in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that the signs of distress of these children will be missed.
Furthermore, the move to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma, which many are already suffering from.
Syria calls on the "occupation forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in his country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the matter would be dealt with accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would “continue to fight this sacred battle until we have purged all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any foreign illegal presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advice to the Syrian and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that made them decide to stay outside the country.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns.
They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel bastion has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had “clear time limits” and expressed the hope that the military action would focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), which would be “eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy of the UN, is expected to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for Syrian participation in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will expect, he is impeached or otherwise removed from office prematurely.
This would be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!
The audience is still going strong.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC have doubled to 1.05 and 1.6 million respectively.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has surpassed the cable news channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for its top-rated nightly news programs.
It is an odd attraction that we still do not understand,” Neal Baer, the show's executive producer, tells me, “Designated Survivor,” a dramatic series on a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after a Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?
Scovell replied, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information overloads when you consider that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” the $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket of Paul Manafort (“a showpiece of overkill,” in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels &apos; s scabrous descriptions of Trump &apos; s anatomy.
As for me, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
Offering something new every night is what makes it a reality show, says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of "Pawn Stars," when he talks about the alternating Trump and daily storylines (whether it's fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you want to keep up.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss last week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we used to do all those crazy things and people said that was the beginning of the end of Western civilisation,” he says.
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows into the mid-term elections of the House of Representatives.
It is no surprise that the money is flowing into the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a district in the Congress with two candidates seeking re-election to the same seat.
Pittsburgh's 10th Congressional District, which was redrawn recently, is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another challenger for re-election, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps significantly with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding war between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became well known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political experts have given the democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later reversed course.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Trump Organization evicted the management team of the Organization.
The State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of the US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
However, El Salvador was only sanctioned, which had already received around 140 million dollars of US aid 2017 for, among other things, the control of the drug trade, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the meetings progressed, the United States and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
However, by mid-September, the high-level officials in the administration made it clear that their intention was to proceed with the conference, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three American envoys returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman rejected comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of the special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also thought to be investigating the possibility that Trump's campaign was working in tandem with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that body, just as he is about to stand for re-election, and perhaps ultimately before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional language, and I do not mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, or the equivalent of Europe's.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the war.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have stood up to him and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world revolves around these points of inflexion, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The United States is now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good position since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating on his inability to do the job.
Rosenstein says that The Times' explanation is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonesty?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will be facing a long winter for democracy.
However, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my house as an ambassador.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play home and away against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the start of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
We got a good result, because Villarreal is a good team.
We started the match believing we could win and left with a point.
Perhaps we could have won the match, but perhaps the draw was a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we came out fighting and were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the previous game. But with all the support from the crowd, I am sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough one for me with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a definite feeling that things are on the up.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying themselves enormously and we are having a good training session.
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.
The fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few spoke about this with their relatives.
About half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a relative, but they are not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as these options can be a factor in the cost.
Include your financial adviser in the conversion to your financial adviser, as he/she may be able to help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Its options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover costs or self-insure with savings, provided that it has the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Arrange for a power of attorney to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
It can also prepare a notarial power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always at hand.
Not only the finances are at stake: 'What kind of doctors do we have to treat?' asks Martin.
What medicines is he taking?
Who will look after the dog?
It is necessary to have everything planned.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number expected to rise.
With communications cut off, the aid workers have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some details about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The region, which is an administrative unit below the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west coast of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is often struck by earthquakes.
We now summarize some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 metres high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 tsunami and earthquake.
This time, however, the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The Indonesian island of Lombok was hit by a series of earthquakes, killing more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report published by the State of Alaska Police.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin was held in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held without bond.
He was brought before the court, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked to make a statement, according to the chain.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska veterans court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interfering with a domestic assault complaint and being in possession of a firearm while intoxicated, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had punched him in the face.
Several veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking the violent behavior of her son to post-traumatic stress disorder from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communications networks have collapsed and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just to the side of the centre of Sulawesi, which is to the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for a suspect in the New York terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bike lane attack on the West Side Highway in Manhattan last October, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and caused "serious bodily injury," in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two posts carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to the prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York has prosecuted a capital case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the flag of ISIS to be flown in his hospital room, the police said.
He was acquitted of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represents Saipov, said that they are &quot; obviously disappointed &quot; with the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilty to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved.
The defence team for Saipov had previously requested that the prosecutors not seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said that politicians needed to "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the EU negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have left by now if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided ranks has been highlighted further by a group of Tories coming out in favour of remaining in the EU in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers deal on track in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that he will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the Euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between his package and 'chaos'.
Leave Means Leave MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.
This Member for Wellingborough added: "I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his declaration of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the protest, where she said to reporters: "Just one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public at large do not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: 'Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said to the assembled that the politicians would feel the heat if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
It is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
We will mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with the Brexit and never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
While the pro-remain campaigners were out canvassing the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards reading "Tories Against Brexit" after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for the security problems they had with an application of the party during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be called a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of running for president
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday was the town's 30th election since Trump took office.
A reporter asked him if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes having a woman at the top.
A man was arrested for the murder of LSU football player Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot and killed Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University at first light on Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98m player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is closing in on the world title after the team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the moment when Valtteri Bottas was classified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the orders from Mercedes would have a major role to play in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into the shade by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to go into the pits and let Hamilton run in his slipstream, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strongly and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a move that left the Ferrari driver with nowhere to go and he had to give way.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished seventh in the first race.
He led a large part of the race while clinging to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally made it into boxes in the 44th lap, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to regain fourth place.
It has been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman in letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job in finding a perfect match.” said Hamilton.
That was a really bad language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were people who were "bad, repugnant and false."
The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false.
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say "But I didn't do it."
I did not do it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember their response... "Oh, oh, 'what'?"
Oh, no.
I did not filter it out.
Well, wait a minute.
Have we filtered it? No, we haven't filtered it," he said while imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and denied that the leak came from her office in early September.
“I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I did.
However, the President's refusal did not seem to sit well with him, as he commented during his Saturday night address: "I will tell you one thing: that was some really bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.
Continuing with his defence of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they do not care who they hurt, who they have to trample over to get the power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made amends for their defeat in the Elite League by beating Belfast Giants 5-3 at home on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie drew the local derby before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalled the Dundee record before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured Dundee's victory.
This was the third defeat in a row for Adam Keefe's men in the Elite League, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast the previous Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
The first goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what was a very lively opening period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game in the 13th minute, before Matt Marquardt equalised for the home side in the 15th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalised with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Dundee to a first lead in the game at the end of the second half and to secure the victory with the fifth goal of their team in the closing stages.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
A traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake plane.
An Indonesian air traffic controller was hailed as a hero after dying in the process of ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people died and many are still missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to shake the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues' attempts to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu control tower, which was being buffeted by strong winds.
He stood firm to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
The plane was forced to land after the pilot thought it was about to crash.
He died later in hospital.
The decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait, who spoke to the Australian ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
Our hearts break when we hear this.
While the authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, the national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of victims is expected to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people have not been contacted.
Tsunamis up to six metres high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible to the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.
The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
Is the United States ready for this?” asked CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in the first few months of this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the accident in a lagoon.
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the sinking aircraft safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon it had been unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and the crew after the aircraft crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been moved to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The aircraft and the United States Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very low.
That is extremely good news, said Jaynes.
Jaynes comments that he and other travellers managed to make progress through water up to their waists to the emergency exits of the aircraft which was beginning to sink.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that the sailors who were working on a nearby pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the aviation safety network indicates that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A commentator presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up its case in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst from the US Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He presented before the jury the way he used the mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone records showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified that he had not been in the city on the day in question.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, “He wiped her from his life.”
The defence is due to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be over that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop moved away from its roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Interpreters like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Is there another black person?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her after a text she wrote was deemed "racist."
A New York nanny is suing a couple for wrongful termination after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the demand to extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her consternation at discovering that the new childminder, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON”, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realising his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman sacked Maurice, claiming that his previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that he was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent the money home on Uber.
Mauritius is now suing the couple for compensation for the termination of the employment contract for the position of six months of work for which she had been hired, but without a contract.
“I want to show you that things are not done that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it is a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most sensible course of action, as they feared that they could not trust him after he had offended them.
My wife had sent him something he did not want to hear.
She is not racist.
We are not racist,” said Joel Plasco to the Post.
“Would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn baby?
“Come on!”
Comparing the demand as “extortion,” Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to go for someone like that?
That is not very decent,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still pending, the couple have been condemned by public opinion on social media, criticised for their behaviour and their logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new survey
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the map: "It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who was reading it for the first time before its publication.
It is good to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC page boy before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the book for children, had hoped that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books was “a bittersweet” occasion after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very quiet man and did not like to boast.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if he had a son who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, though it was not really your achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although he was the creator and the product of his own imagination, he always gave credit to the original Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
On landing, her daughter was immediately transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said that he would call regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to succeed.
I received a call from Nad to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did.
I said to him: "Tashi, I love you so much, darling."
I will be with you shortly.
I will be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were running out and his system was failing.
She had died too soon and everything was fading.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not howl, scream or cry out because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand my ground.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was to come.
No one knew.
I bent my head and the tears kept falling.
It is difficult to explain, but it was in the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all your love and understanding.
He knew how much I loved him.
Widows in black mourning to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I do not want any father to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up any place.
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
I am constantly concerned that it could have repercussions.
Davis created the cards "so that people know there are people to talk to and people to talk to, even if it is a friend."
You have to talk about it, you have to speak out.
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a friend of Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
He did not say he was depressed or anything like that.
We noticed a change in his attitude a couple of days before Christmas.
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.
He said that his death was a great shock to them, but they have to get over it: "It leaves a big hole in the family."
We have been devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs by a thread as the FBI begins its investigation
Mr. Flake said on Saturday that he thought that if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited investigation, a limited scope), perhaps we could bring some unity to it, and he feared that the committee was "going off the rails" in the midst of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican allies not want the FBI investigation to proceed?
Its refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
There are only five weeks to go before the mid-term elections, on 6 November. If the Republicans do badly, their attempts to get the man they want for the Supreme Court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The figures for deserters from North Korea &quot; fall &quot; with Kim Jong-il.
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that 1,127 deserters were reported last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the most stringent border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by people traffickers, have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
Most of the deserters from the north are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most refugees flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected DMZ between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said that Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee to the Supreme Court, was a "hysterical" nominee and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
I cannot help but think that if a woman had acted in that way, they would have said she was hysterical," said Pelosi on her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used the emotion of the moment to deny the sexual assault allegations against Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking up while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also condemned the Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by disgruntled liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
I think he has shot himself in the foot with those statements and the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats.
Pelosi raised objections when asked if she would challenge Kavanaugh if he were confirmed to the Supreme Court and the Democrats gained a majority in the House.
I will say one thing: if he is not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he is not fit to be on the court he is on now.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, which is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
This is not the time for an hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine.
Women have to wield it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury, and she cannot let go without crying.
We cry when we are angry, Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
I do not think that is so unusual, is it?
He continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in a company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was talking: "Perhaps you think I am crying because I am angry."
No, I am not angry.”
And he continued with what he was doing.
I thought that was great.
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger, in part because they are not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once when I found myself in tears with an ineffable rage. A senior woman manager, a serious woman I had always been slightly afraid of, grabbed me by the collar and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
They have no idea how angry you are.
They think you are sad and will be glad because they think they have trapped you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board a ship called Monkey Business, which he had to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, had the idea of running herself.
It was not a well-considered decision, he said with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they did not need another one.
Someone once referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
As the campaign was already well under way, he fell behind in the fund-raising, and was promised that he would not be allowed to run again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost cause.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, gave him only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?”, he asked.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on capturing voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown, said Schroeder, recalling the reaction of the press.
You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, 'What are they going to put on my tombstone?'
The word "wept" is not in the original.
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing.
The first salvo of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning to China in early 2018, when he imposed tariffs on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The escalation this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, which will tax half the products that come into the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has retaliated by imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent on American products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match the attacks of the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will back down soon.
To back down to Washington would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a rapid policy decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a crash landing in the economy in either country is in fact much more dangerous than has been recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, associate fellow at the Center for New American Security, focused on Asia issues.
Syria is ready to receive the refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
The situation on the ground is today more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The government is still rehabilitating the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of the refugees who had to leave their country because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still six million people living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had promoted the insurgency.
Ryder Cup goes to Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last Ryder Cup victory in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, launched his ball into the water on the 16th hole, admitting defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari was outstanding in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to have ever recorded a 5-0-0 score since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world number one, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio García, a veteran who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most wins in the tournament's history, with 25.5 points in his career.
I do not usually cry, but today I cannot help it.
It has been a very hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have won the cup.
It is a team effort and I am very proud to have been able to help them,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now it is the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who defeated the golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a match play event.
I feel an incredible pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching this man play golf.
Woods lost the four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is an extraordinary statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf all weekend.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these guys, they never gave up."
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
However, we spoiled it.
I would like to congratulate Mr Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Luxembourg's 12 players played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
We must now bow our heads.
We have been outdone.”
Update of red tide: Decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FFWC) shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, irregular bloom conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a reduction in concentrations.
The red tide bloom extends approximately 130 miles along the Pinellas County coast from the north to the Lee County line.
Irregular parcels can be found as far as 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but less so than last week.
Red tide has also been detected in Pasco County.
During the past week, medium concentrations have been reported in Pinellas County and on its coast, low concentrations in Hillsborough County, medium to high concentrations on the bottom in Manatee County, medium to high concentrations on the bottom in Sarasota County and its coast, medium to high concentrations on the bottom in Charlotte County, medium to high concentrations on the bottom in Lee County and on its coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwest corner of Florida during the past week.
