The members of the Assembly of Wales (AM, for its acronym in English) are worried about "looking like muppets"
Some members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for its English acronym).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Welsh Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all political spectrums are worried that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned that "it would be a waste of time" to work with the two parties.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member of the Welsh Assembly said the whole group was "disappointed" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the jump from pronunciation of MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name change, says: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Assembly members will be a matter for the Assembly members themselves."
The 2017 law of the Welsh Government gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which revealed widespread support for calling the Welsh Assembly to Parliament.
On the question of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the option MWP obtained the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the Assembly are suggesting alternatives, but the fight for consensus could bring the president of the Assembly, Elin Jones, to a head, as she would have to send the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will have the final say on how to name the legislation.
The Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will decide Sunday whether their country will change its name to "Republic of Macedonia of the North."
The popular vote was called to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent in Harlem because of the difficulties of the churches there
“Historically, the people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“Today, there is neither one nor the other.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods where people go regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is worried that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "at some point, they will return to the starting point."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who won't help the churches that are left in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and, therefore, will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and San Martín a decade later.
The white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that was worshipping in the building acquired it.
A black congregation took over St. Martin's, under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while the parishioners of Father Johnson were making plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martín, called them with pride "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who played the organ called it: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church carillon, the largest in the world, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in the last months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the parish's top lay leadership, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was trying to pass the costs to the parish council, even though the council had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for abalone in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for langostas in California on the first day of the langostas season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about an hour when they heard the child calling for help, so they went over to help him.
Hammel said he initially thought Lo Piccolo was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then realized he was screaming "they bit me."
He had a broken collarbone, said Hammel when he reached the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel said.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain, Larry Giles, said in a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper chest.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Cardiff, to Swami's Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to boost the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff in their beauty and style departments.
In order to significantly boost the beauty market in the UK, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with a growth that is increasing in comparison with the decline in sales of fashion and homeware, the biggest beauty stores will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, will be rolled out in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other stores, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup line with a majority of animal-friendly products, something that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was recently opened in Croydon, in the south of London, last week. The second will open in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
The online shops and the change towards the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local shops force supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the stores would look more like shopping centres as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount stores into hundreds of its stores and introduced several Habitat stores since it bought these chains two years ago. It is believed this has boosted food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over how to split the profits from the drugstore products in their supermarkets.
The new strategy is being considered after the sale of 281 pharmacies to Sainsbury's by Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a wider range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to make them more appealing to our customers."
We have also invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive and comfortable environment makes us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11m contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, was furious after Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the fashion and accessories brand Truly.
This business had compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was furious when the girl of gold on TV admitted that her new deals, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to devote to Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the head office of her business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was being percieved as the favorite to double Willoughby's fortune of about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source said: "Holly was truly the number one priority of Holly."
He was going to be her future long-term, which would keep her in the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved totally stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters, ready to be put on the market.
Experts believe the exit of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes, and, possibly, delay its launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, who is 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were on vacation together and Jones has a 40 % stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night there was no talk of business matters.
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some consider "not presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of a news presenter.
“I haven't given up anything.”
He said Kim is interested in meeting with him after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's principal diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an "adequate" response from the United States to its first steps toward denuclearization.
On the contrary, he said, the United States continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's speech was much more optimistic than the one he gave during his rally.
“We get along great with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
They would have killed millions of people.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of missile tests, help to free hostages and bringing home the remains of U.S. soldiers killed in action.
He also defended his unusual approach to Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but here, in this stadium full of people, we would have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was reported to foreign NGOs that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no emergency was declared, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” says Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palu, they still don't know if foreign staff can work on the ground.
The national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo said the authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international aid agencies could be allowed in.
Considering that the earth moves constantly in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami sirens in Palu, even though there was a warning in advance, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, traveling from one island in Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make things even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the country's battered infrastructure the central theme of his campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is facing reelection next year.
He must also face the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equalizes the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League with a late goal to earn a 1-1 draw at Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri from about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot and kicked it to the second post.
The action was sent over the area and went to the right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to parry it with a leap and fell into the net.
“I was trying to get myself in that position to take control of the ball and the players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself all the time possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I gave him a nudge. I didn’t think too much about it, I just shot.”
Chelsea was winning 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' mediapunta made a pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning and doing a dribble near the middle of the field and entering the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran down the middle of the field.
After that, he made a nice pass to Hazard, who took it to the area.
Hazard was in front of the defense and shot the ball into the net with a left-footed kick that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool plays against the Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples (Italy).
On the other hand, Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's disaster management agency at first light on Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and which triggered waves of up to six meters, according to the spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder of a woman after she was stabbed to death.
An investigation into murder has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews, in John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder.
The police have urged people in the area to come forward if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the area at the time and who may have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us."
I would also recommend any person, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the body found is that of a woman from Birkenhead and that it was found inside a property.
Some people who thought they knew the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have informed the family of the victim that they are in the process of informing them.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police say no one can enter or leave the building.
He was left speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Now, residents are being told they can return to their homes in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
He keeps repeating "it's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents were standing guard inside the cordon, watching the building.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police on DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, reference 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in the Parliament becomes the last commemorative success by "rewriting history"
His prohibition would be a poetic act of justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects and artifacts in England carried out by his fanatical followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr Crick as "madness" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice the wrong Cromwell by the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As the Telegraph's Sunday editor, Charles Moore, wrote: "Many people consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, a defender of parliament against external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy."
If this is a completely accurate description, then the debate continues.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has given shape to our nation's later development, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A killer pig attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in the southwest of China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his last name Yuan, was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, as the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pigsty in Xining, Qinghai province.
It seems he travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood on its mouth in the pigsty.
The autopsy confirmed that the pig had attacked the farmer until death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and broken,” said the cousin, who goes by the name Wu, to The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
It seems that the family of Yuan and the authorities of the market are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing almost 295 pounds cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it away.
After pigs ate a rancher in Oregon in 2012, a rancher in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "discharge trigger."
They're just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What we have to do is give them the respect they deserve.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rains over the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern Mexican coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains across the northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa caused gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, from Sunday morning (Eastern time) and was located about 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressure systems are starting to form, which are moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will start to push the intense tropical rains northward, towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain hits the low pressure system that is approaching, there will be widespread heavy precipitation in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause flash floods in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Forecasters expect between 5 and 10 inches of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in the greater part of Arizona.
Due to the nature of tropical rains, it is possible that sudden floods occur with conditions that worsen quickly.
Due to the threat of torrential tropical rains, it is not recommended to go on foot in the desert.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms could cause strong winds and local dust storms.
The approaching low pressure systems will bring heavy rains to specific areas of the southern coast of California.
Heavy rains could leave up to two inches of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains of the wet season.
Some tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before becoming widespread by Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and all day Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes will be observed in the US due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this means drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of this is what will happen in the whole of the US on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures generally in the mid-20s from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures could reach 26 degrees, 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates above-average temperatures for the eastern half of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly happening in the 1980s, on Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the policy remained stalled and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest news from Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct an investigation for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she has absolute certainty that Kavanaugh groped her in high school and tried to take off her clothes at a party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely sure that that hadn't happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who Nielsen said watched on Friday have seen it.
The company counted the audience share for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has some problems in estimating how many people see something in the office.
For perspective, it's like a playoff game or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led the pack, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3,1 million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million and CNN had 2,52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the Republican moderate office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the morning of Friday, the CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Judiciary Committee.
As he received these criticisms, which were being broadcast live by CNN, he appeared dejected.
“Looking me in the face”, she said.
“Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?”
And he continued: "You have power when there are so many women who don't have it."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would have more to say at his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and broadcast television networks were broadcasting the hearings live hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake took his decision.
Flake's decision was crucial, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British prime minister, arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham (Britain) on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to pay the other's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Simpson arrested as suspect in death of LSU player Wayde
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made public a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A bail bond of $350,000 has been set, according to the defense.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court released a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the Louisiana State Police, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the police for their diligence and search for justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday that his team is "devastated" and "in shock" over the death of Wayde Sims.
“These are the things that always worry people,” said Wade.
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexican people to stay away from the volcano after it showed signs of activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center registered several tremors and quakes.
In social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 km southeast of Mexico City, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face separatists before Catalan referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after protesters clashed with police during a demonstration by Catalan independence supporters while thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the police, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally filled with tourists.
There were also confrontations later and the police used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with messages like "no forgiveness, no forgetting", faced off against unionists shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1, 2017, referendum on independence, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, as those opposed to secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling stations across the region, where there were violent confrontations.
The groups in favor of independence camped out Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost all hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck.
Despite a narrow victory in the December regional elections, the procatalanist parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in exile or under house arrest, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the police protest on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
“It's getting more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“To run for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for driving a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the entrances and the building itself.
At some point, it is possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
A Livingston promoted impressed Rangers by securing their second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of Rangers.
The attack by Dolly Menga made the difference. Gary Holt's team went up a place, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard's team have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table with eight points' advantage.
Before, Rangers receive Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their winning streak to six games in the division. Holt, the first-team coach, has yet to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miller in January.
Livingston fails to take advantage of a tough opponent
Holt's team should have gone a step ahead much earlier, causing all kinds of problems for Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defense, but missed his shot in front of the goal. Then, Alan Lithgow's shot went wide after he had gone in for a header and Craig Halkett's shot went in front of the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-control play.
And that's how he scored the winning goal.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston looked for an opening, combining with Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that moment, Rangers were in control of the ball, but couldn't get past the host's defense and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
This game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Allan McGregor, Rangers' goalkeeper, saved a shot from Scott Pittman with a kick, and Lithgow was wide of another Livingston shot.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly being played in, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one after a Halkett header on the substitute Glenn Middleton and another after a handball.
“Fantastic” from Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A fantastic performance and result for Livingston.
The general consensus is that they played a great game that exceeded expectations of an upward trajectory.
His style of play and his squad have hardly changed since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt's ability to strengthen the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was immense and led a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good moments with Gerrard, they came up short.
They failed to materialize their plays, as they only managed to get into the Rangers' half once, which is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received a mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during breakfast for the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It's the last day of the controversial visit of the Turkish president to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's bid to join the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Colonia to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers showed up in the area to see their president.
Opponents of Erdogan also made themselves heard, many of them Kurds, who condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a car
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended by the paramedics, but he died there.
The accident happened after a cyclist died after being hit by a car that fled the scene in Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and it has been advised to drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in disturbances
Six prison guards were injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the director of the prison.
The disturbances started at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 on Sunday and are still continuing.
A team of elite specialists (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the fights, which involve eight inmates and affect a wing.
The agents received assistance for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specialist staff have been deployed to deal with the incident at Long Lartin prison.
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.
Long Lartin prison in the UK holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had received medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In October last year, prison guards called for reinforcements from anti-disturbance agents to deal with a serious incident in which prisoners attacked the prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It's unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen at the beginning of next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for the western Arizona, southern Nevada, eastern California and southeastern Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving showers behind at the end of the day.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 hurricanes had maintained their status as a tropical storm or depression within a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached almost 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of torrential rains, which can reach up to 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
It is likely that between 2 and 5 inches of rain will fall, with the possibility of reaching 10 inches in isolated areas, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rains are a blessing, as the region is suffering from drought.
Although an inundation is a very serious matter, it is likely that part of these torrential rains will be beneficial due to the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the Monitor of Drought of the United States, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering from extreme drought, the second highest category, as it was communicated in weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which is still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 mph, is 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 mph.
The storm is finding itself in cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
As a result, it is expected to intensify into a tropical storm by the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at risk of flooding.
“Heavy rains are expected from Baja California to Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters,” as reported by weather.com.
After that, Rosa will head north towards Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression. Later, it will move southwards towards Utah by the end of Tuesday.
The main danger to Rosa or her remains is the torrential downpour in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the US desert.
It is expected that these rains will cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Four arrested in Midsomer Norton for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested as suspects in an attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00am on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he is "stable."
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to the police.
The agents have made a call to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the dirty tricks and shameless tactics of the Democrat Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered the "meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Senate on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Likewise, Ford testified in the session on this accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, the Americans saw the shrewdness, quality and bravery of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with an admirable record of service to the public,” he said to his supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“We have five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.”
I'm not running, but I am a candidate.
“That's why I go from place to place fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction"
It is expected that the first key vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday, according to a high-ranking Republican official to CNN.
Hundreds of dead in a quake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is rising
At least 384 people have died and many more have been swept away by the enormous waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday night when waves of up to six meters arrived at the coast in the evening, dragging many to their death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When it was announced that a tsunami was possible, people were still on the beach and didn’t leave immediately, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, for its Indonesian acronym) in a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it destroyed everything on land,” said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also said that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and derrumbados, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The gunfire continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in a region with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT, for its Indonesian acronym) said in a statement that the energy released by the Friday's earthquake was 200 times greater than the energy released by the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which is set at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
As he said, they found bodies of some victims trapped under the rubble of the buildings that had been destroyed. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage could be greater along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were totally paralyzed and there was no information from Donggala, said Nugroho.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there”, said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for not informing about the tsunami that hit Palu, although the authorities say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording shared on social media, a man can be heard warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in the area around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army started sending planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic products.
The city's airport has reopened for emergency and rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a visit planned to the evacuation centers in Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although the staff of World Vision in Donggala have arrived safely in Palu, where they are sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating scene on their way, said the Mr Doseba.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as the groups of aid workers put the gears in motion for disaster assistance, some people were complaining that the authorities were not allowing the movement of experienced aid workers to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign aid, supplies and personnel can be used in disaster areas if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says that he is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but that hasn't happened yet.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people still missing still had hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the stories that natural disasters write.
On Saturday, a small child was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the national parapente team instructor, had trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia this month.
Others who were caught in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Because of my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr. Gendon remembered how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the community of parapente, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to his competitors who were participating in the festival that was being held on the beach.
However, his messages only showed a grey checkmark, not two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren't delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a cash reload at a Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, a group of thieves robbed a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a police department news release.
The driver of the car had emptied a cash machine in a leisure centre and was preparing to reload it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for reloading.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved.
Any person with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West."
West has been called Ye for some time now. He used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Ariana Grande was replaced by the singer Camila Cabello, who had to cancel her performance due to "emotional reasons", as the creator of the show commented.
In addition, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, which means ‘you’,” said West in early 2010 while talking about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it means us.
He went from being Kanye, which means 'the only one', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
An old collaborator of West, Jay-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without a hyphen.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico's newly elected president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that he is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when student movements were strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving them monthly subsidies for those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after the announcements of the I. A. of several parts of the U.S. government, even though, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I. A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for the investigation of I. A. would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the U.S. We are looking to the next step in the field of I. A.”, says Lee.
The double financing means double the chances of the next big breakthrough in I. A. happening in the U. S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important I. A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system that defeated the best American player of Othello. Later, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China office.
Lee gave credit to previous competitions of the US government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., investigators have to work hard to get government funding, said Lee.
“It’s not China that’s taking the leaders of academia; it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
In the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired top graduates from universities to work in I. A.
Lee said that some changes in U.S. immigration policy could help intensify U.S. initiatives in I. A.
“I think doctors should be given permanent residency cards automatically,” he said.
The Chinese State Council's National Development and Reform Commission presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people at academic institutions just like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic sectors. On the other hand, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research on I. A.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that sought to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their country will change its name to "Republic of Macedonia of the North", a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its bid for EU membership and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the new name, but the nationalists argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the participation will reach the 50 % minimum required to make the referendum valid.
In the referendum question, the following was asked: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying to help Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
“I've come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopie.
Although it will not be legally binding, many members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote so that it will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The Electoral State Commission declared that, at 1pm, no irregularities had been reported.
However, participation was only 16 %, compared with 34 % in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I'm here to vote for my children, we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in Skopie.
Zoran Zaev, prime minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on changing the name of Macedonia that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the EU in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament, in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the campaign tents set up by those who were boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not by the back door,” said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
The prime minister says that Macedonia's accession to NATO would bring the investment it needs, as its unemployment rate is over 20 %.
“I think the majority will be in favor, because more than 80 % of citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future."
In a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Public Policies, it was assured that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which means a lower participation than the required.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV, in Macedonia, revealed that 57% of those polled said they would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favor.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the participation must be at least 50 % plus one vote.
If he fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, evades the whole Brighton defense to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart the Brighton defense in the 2-0 win that Manchester City got on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian mediapunta received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three defenders of Brighton before entering open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He evaded a defender before beating several more in the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit it with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot that went to the right.
“Agüero has some problems with his foot”, said Pep Guardiola, City's coach, to the press.
We spoke of him playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave City the initial advantage in the Premier League title race.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton territory.
He made a nice pass to the left wing for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave Sterling a few touches before directing him to the second post.
The Sky blues forward fired the ball into the net just before going offside.
The City faces the Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil the party for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff race, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer is looking forward to taking the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Dodgers beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies have at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still seek their first division title.
“Even though we're not playing for anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the crowd in Denver will be excited and that the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't he want to participate?
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but it seems they are leaning toward leaving Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who will be the opening pitcher, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest routine on Sunday.
The right-hander's record is 18 victories and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 innings.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the Kavanaugh situation, his selection for the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
In November, everything we have done is at stake.
There are five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the most important. I'm not running, but I am fighting for great candidates, so I go from place to place trying to get them.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical democratic group, it's happening right now."
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you can see the meanness, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control. And we're not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
“We saw him these last four days,” he said, saying that the Democrats were “angry, bad, horrible and false.”
He made reference to the Senate Judiciary Committee nominating Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, "What?"
No, no mmm, I'm waiting for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party has a wide range of opinions.
He is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are told we are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, with Europe. It is ironic that he was in disagreement with leaders on issues that were previously agreed upon.
As was made clear in the warning issued by the Labour Party in Nottingham East on Friday, "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been like.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more friendly and compassionate" policy has been forgotten, if it ever really applied in any way.
It is becoming clearer that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged in terms of whether the party leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to change his mind radically and adopt views with which he had never been in agreement, whether on security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who has experienced it.
Indeed, I am luckier than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me tend to be political.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist insults, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have such a wide range of opinions and, with each motion for censure or change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice to keep my head down and not make myself heard too much and that way I would be "all right".
But I haven't gotten into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student, I have been motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government which left my secondary school in ruins, and I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, and I certainly didn't hide them in the last elections.
It is impossible that anyone in Nottingham East did not know my political positions and the areas where I disagreed with the current leaders.
All I can say to those who promoted the motion on Friday is that I don't understand these people's desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunistic politics will stop me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr remain unbeaten and top the league
Two late goals may have decided the final result, but, without doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Now they lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten that are participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defense, as well as their ability to make the most of opportunities, which gave the local team the victory, so the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“We have been put to the test in all the games and we have won all of them, so I have to be happy,”
Robyn Christie, of the Melrose, said: "Ayr deserve the recognition, they took their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card for captain Rory Hughes, on loan from Glasgow Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical disadvantage and Jason Baggot kicked an unconverted try.
Climo extended the lead of Ayr with a penalty. Before that, just before halftime, he scored and converted a solo try, which left the score at 17-5 in favor of Ayr at halftime.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's conversion by Baggot reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long delay after Ruaridh Knott was injured and had to be carried off on a stretcher, and when the game resumed Ayr took the lead with a try by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed them to take advantage of having one more man on the pitch after Bruce Colvine's unsuccessful penalty kick, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for pleasing Climo without the ball, from the line of scrimmage, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry to the corner for the fifth penalty kick for the locals.
The star of Still Game wants to move into the restaurant business
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restaurant business after revealing he has been named director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official registry, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun said Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming Glasgow restaurant scene."
“The sea is ours”: a Bolivia without a coastline has the hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Navy men guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
The blue flags are flying in public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea is ours by right,
It is a duty to recover him.”
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, they still remember vividly the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, as well as the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Bolivia may be on the verge of a breakthrough, as the International Court of Justice is expected to rule on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the failure of the International Court of Justice on large screens spread throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is locked in a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has much to say about the resolution on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia's favor and that the situation would change little if it did.
The UN agency based in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the resolution of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was not complicated, said Chilean expert Paz Zárate, who specializes in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
He also suggested that Morales' bellicose rhetoric has undermined any residual goodwill towards Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talking, but it will be extremely difficult to keep talking after this.
The two countries do not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
The former Bolivian president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the country's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will offer Chile "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 years of mutual disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“This is an opportunity to see what we have to leave behind.”
North Korea says it will not disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to give up its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rivals.
His comments come as Mike Pompeo, the U.S. secretary of state, appears to be on the verge of resuming nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, which has been stalled for more than three months since the summit with Kim Jong U, the North Korean leader.
Ri says that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the US to a declaration that ends the Korean War to subjugate the North is a "quixotic" dream.
Washington is wary of accepting North Korea's declaration without some significant disarmament move first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about North Korea's seriousness in giving up its nuclear arsenal, which it probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is expected to visit Pyongyang in the coming month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of enormous hats that are about to land in a shop near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
The standout piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large items included pineapples with jewels, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation recalled a scuba diving team, complete with diving gear and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're in luck.
The hat-hunters predict that the huge hats could start to be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats are coming strong from "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimetres used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that created this impractical hat that flooded social media also presented another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the model in a bikini who carried it.
The orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season in Paris Fashion Week.
As fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets this summer. As the designer has had a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories."
John Edward: linguistic skills are fundamental for citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a history of excellence in education that has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these centers, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for its English acronym), are working to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools have as their objective to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy in the world.
As a sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages are still a popular and desired subject in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, the message goes to his heart."
If you talk to him in his language, you reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries, you can't rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest rates of approval in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages got an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that make up the SCIS, showed that 72 % of students got an A in Mandarin, while 72 % of students who studied German, 69 % of students who studied French, and 63 % of students who studied Spanish also got an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages because they are seen as a fundamental competitive advantage that children and young people will need in the future without a doubt.
Today, languages are considered to be on the same level as the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects in the study plans of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, of the reasons given by employers about difficulties in filling jobs, 17% were attributed to a shortage of linguistic skills.
Therefore, linguistic skills are becoming more and more indispensable for preparing young people for their future careers.
The opportunities for work that require foreign languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last their whole life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will give that person an automatic advantage over the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, the 15%, was French.
This is why investing in language education is important for children today.
If you know several languages, especially those of developing economies, you will be better equipped to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on modern classics, while others will teach the most important languages for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools he can choose between several languages taught by specialist teachers.
The independent schools in Scotland devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages still have an important role to play in the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered "languages for international communication."
The independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
He had to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James makes his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for the fans who are waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Luke Walton, Lakers' coach, announced that James will play in the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
However, it is still unclear how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that it was likely that James would play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason schedule of the Lakers.
“In this stage of my career I don’t need preseason games to prepare myself,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five Trump campaign rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court in the meantime, Trump is seeking support for the midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see it online through a live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on this week's Kavanaugh hearings, which were tense because of sexual misconduct allegations and have left the Senate in limbo for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans who are facing the November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, the Trump campaign signaled that the five rallies next week are meant to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House," according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the campaign,” said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named.
The rally is scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage from Pittsburgh.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for Senate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows it is willing to fight to keep alive the hope of individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needs.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept in sports, but the players believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So, where do you think the impetus is now?
“We were six points behind and now we’re four points behind, so I guess that’s a little bit of a boost,” said Jordan Spieth after the round.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more to play for.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel they have a bit of wind in their favor and plenty of reasons to be motivated, among other reasons because of the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got four points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal off the tee and preaches with example.
The guttural roars of celebration rose in volume as the pair's round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth round when they were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the win in the 15th was received with a similar cry, one that conveyed that the US team had not yet been eliminated.
“What we need to do is redouble our efforts and concentrate on the game,” said Spieth.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe have won four of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple that didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That run and the way he plays with the noisy crowd makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there won't be any other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Better to be in two different holes at the same time.
However, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball in the morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help to get out of the holes.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch because you can see the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the U.S. team is willing to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good lead after the first day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a score of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over Tiger Woods, who was in trouble, gaining four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a US team that committed many errors during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. team fought back in the foursomes, winning two matches, but couldn't close the gap.
The American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, who were dubbed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership served to beat a dejected Woods and a rookie American Bryson DeChambeau by a score of 5-4.
Woods, who struggled in the two matches on Saturday, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to be Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and number three players in the world respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe was not having all its way.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas served as references for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has recovered from a four-point deficit in the individual matches only twice, but Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that mounting a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is no chance of unilateral disarmament if they don't have confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the UN that the continuation of sanctions deepened their distrust of the US and that there was no possibility of their country renouncing their nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" in 2017, including halting nuclear and missile tests and dismantling nuclear test sites, and committing to not proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received any similar response from the United States.
“If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of us disarming first unilaterally.”
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization formula that rewards Pyongyang for taking steps, his statement is important, because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization without preconditions, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to working toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must renounce its nuclear weapons before it can be considered to have ended the war.
Washington has resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a fantasy of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our distrust.
Ri did not mention any plans for a second Trump-Kim summit, announced with great fanfare by the US president at the UN General Assembly earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the interested party in the denuclearization of the peninsula, the denuclearization of the peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri's tone was radically different from last year's speech to the UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles toward US soil after Trump called Kim Jong-un "a madman with a nuclear button."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving toward disarmament, but said there was still much to do and that sanctions would have to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its advances.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and without deviation until we realize a fully verifiable and complete denuclearization."
The UN Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang in a month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had been progress, but a few hours later North Korea denounced that its "demands were those of a gangster".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea agreed to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US applied the “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the measures he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to sleep enough
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all students are now sleeping more in an attempt to fight the growing culture of studying all night drinking coffee.
A professor discovered that the students at the number one university in the world don't have a clue about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was just finding out about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of dreams, which surprised me.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only a few hours a week.
The course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In another section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to bed.
In another section, participants are told that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After, an icon of the campus with interactive icons animates the participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that students won't change their behavior immediately.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the effects of smoking tobacco.
He said the culture of pride in staying up all night still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain generate a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
I hope the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
The professor's recommendation is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic devices and LED lights, which can alter circadian rhythms, so that they would have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal sinks Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another bout of depression away from home, when the attack of Dolly Menga drove Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Rangers wanted to win their first away game since February's 4-1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team won for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, who are the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga's attack came just minutes before half-time and Rangers' lacklustre performance was not up to the task.
Now, Rangers drop to sixth, Livingston move up to third, behind Hibs by the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as judge of the line Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance after someone threw an object from the visiting bench.
Gerrard changed eight of the starters who won the game against Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scottish Cup.
On the other hand, Holt took 11 players from Livingston who drew 1-1 with Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his organized team suffocated their opponents throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored in the first two minutes when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman who passed through the defense leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent it out.
Keaghan Jacobs committed a foul in the penalty area for the captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, could only send it out for a corner.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the game when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored his request.
The Rangers got two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble dealing with the header from Lassana Coulibaly and the boring shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the Livingston goal scored in the 34th minute was against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a deep ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to score.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an immediate impact, as the winger played a ball to Morelos, but Kelly was impressive in blocking it.
However, Livingston continued to play the type of game that he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing the way with long passes.
The Holt team could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor kept his nerve to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed home a corner that didn't go in.
The Rangers' substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty in the final minutes of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the “Sunday Morning” newspaper: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and COUNTING... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The physicist Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado", with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of scientists cowboys.
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium."
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity emitted by the minerals.
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
The method requires extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
So, they can "see" a common protein in many cancers and re-inject it.
A vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein called HER2 in many cancers, and then reinjecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer”, such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West went on a rant in favor of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often speak with a white person and they ask me how I can like Trump since he is racist.
Well, if I worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
Saturday Night Live started the show with a sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in relation to the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted the video of the West's tirade on social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
He also said backstage that he had a hard time wearing the hat.
They messed with me.
They told me not to wear my hat.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see me asleep?" and added that he was "going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to advance?"
Try with love.”
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice and the members of SNL seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died recently.
West surprised many when he came out on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING AGAINST THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I decide NO to reward someone (buying his music or clothes, or supporting his art) who I consider is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We also”, he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
It's not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as P Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague Snoop Dogg has also changed his name to Snoop Lion, without forgetting the legendary musician Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
It is expected that the accused will appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecutor's office will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those roles in film often transmitted to young men that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thinks “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he thinks it's "fairly important" to address the issue.
“Personally, I think it’s quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?”
“What have we been teaching our men while they were growing up, thinking about the problems they are facing now?”
Kit believes that television can have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young men feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time. How do we change?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong with the education of the young.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any spin-offs or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
He recently revealed that he thinks knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he got out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, I have given my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose was Ygritte, the love interest of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm in the Leslie family in Scotland.
China reports 14% more new HIV/AIDS cases
China has announced a 14 % increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country there are more than 820,000 people affected, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of them were infected by sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread quickly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV from this practice has decreased to a great extent, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB community suffers much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have calculated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) on Thursday denied that a member of her staff leaked information about Republican senators to the media and said the allegations are “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
Representative Maxine Waters criticized Saturday the accusations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said those accusations were being pushed by right-wing commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies”, said Waters in a tweet.
According to the information published, the phone numbers and addresses of the US senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah, were included.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted the information on the Internet during a Senate Judiciary Committee session on the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the posts was associated with Waters' office and made public the data of a member of Waters' staff, according to the Capitol.
“This accusation is completely unfounded and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not responsible for the leak of this information.
This allegation is completely false and a complete lie.
Waters's statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including from the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Denies this information with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that the necessary temperance to be a Member of Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
Don't rebel.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and serene.
It seems that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during his Thursday testimony.
Republican Omar Navarro, who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it's true, it's very serious,” tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and the agencies charged with enforcing the law" about the fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure the authors are found,” he continued, “and that they are considered legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all my staff members.”
Johnny English: Back in Action. Rowan Atkinson's parody of the spy falls short
Now it's a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new British film. It seems that this is what you should do with this new parodic action and comedy Johnny English film, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satire about how clearly crazy we are the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his license for the second time. Just his name already gives clues that this is a comedy created for non-English speaking territories.
Of course, it's the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims of wasting glamour, has a little of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that type who touched a single note in the theme of Carros de fuego that touched on the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious international traveller and international figure that Atkinson had already depicted years ago in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, sowing chaos in his wake.
In this last installment, there are a couple of good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armour as the rotors hit the helmet.
The physical comedy of Atkinson is obvious, but the humor is a bit short and is oddly superfluous, especially now that franchises like James Bond and Mission Impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
The humor seems more directed to children than to adults, and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as ingenious and accurate as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in deep trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the supersecret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent in service, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who is seeing her popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisors tell him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That must be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh school, although he gives extra-curricular lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy similar to the one in Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old pal Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submariner captain, a role he doesn't take advantage of enough with Vicki Pepperdine.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of the Queen return to action, with the beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a charismatic billionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve the problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a fancy French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on a luxurious yacht of Volta; moreover, English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Undoubtedly, they put a lot of effort into this last sequence, but, however funny and noisy it may be, the whole thing still conveys a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies it is working on a plan to have Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but would be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the owners of companies to use the savings from the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to give their workers an extra day off.
So, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "would fit" into the party's economic agenda and would favor the workers.
This change to a four-day week has received the support of the Congress of Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: We expect the review of the directive to be announced before the end of the year.
“You can’t get it all at once, but the four-day work week is definitely a question that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, not all of the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not part of the party's policy and will not be discussed at this time."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to restore powers to anonymous directors and directors who had been "exploited" to run public services.
One of the shadow minister's plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies will not get back all their shares, as a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond with the irregularities detected.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on the boards of companies and create inclusive property funds in which 10 % of shares of private companies would have to be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh on "60 Minutes" and if it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice by at least a week and raises the question of whether the results of the investigation could influence any Republican senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will air Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
Of course, said Kennedy.
I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out and I asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, and determined.
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
“I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it tajantely,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she names can confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case.
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival where a star-studded lineup comes together for a mission as impressive as it is: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see hundreds of thousands of people travel to Central Park to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real objective of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group that aims to end poverty through the increase of people who actively fight against it.
If you want a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert-goers have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions," such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or any other thing that serves to raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or not is it just another form of "clicktivism", which is the term we use to describe the position we take when we think we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million actions in favor of a wide range of goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have achieved commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which, at least 10 billion dollars have been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based association of investors and implementers united by the common goal of "helping children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, they have pledged $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
Thanks to the support of the United Kingdom government, the donors, the national governments and partners like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions asked on his website about what can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and difficult road and, in many cases, we will stumble and fall.
But, as they have already achieved in the past with the movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will have in New York this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of Russian energy exports - Department of the Interior
In case necessary, Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates on behalf of the legitimate government, is just a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced they are in the Middle East to negotiate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier of last resort for Europe.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to deal with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to guarantee that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market.
Zinke addressed the people who attended a meeting organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the "voice of the consumer energy industry" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia consists, basically, of taking advantage and replacing fuels, he said, adding that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made as the Trump administration has been trying to push liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted on all occasions that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has a value of 11 billion dollars and is intended to double the current capacity of the gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only motivated by economic reasons and is another example of unfair competition.
I think we all share the idea that energy can't be turned into a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The US position has found itself, however, with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry federation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in the EU's energy policy or in bilateral energy agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibility of running for president in 2020, says the senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday she will study the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
During a hearing in the Holyoke, Massachusetts, City Council, Warren confirmed that he was considering this challenge.
It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women among our leaders, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a press conference at City Hall and said he was "taking the country down the wrong path."
“I really worry about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke without hesitation about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from Friday, Warren said "It's absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
A 58% of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said she should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% of those polled supported his candidacy.
In the poll, a majority of respondents said they would support former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick in a possible presidential bid, while a majority said they would oppose him.
Other Democratic Party members spoke about the possible candidacy for the 2020 presidency of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would decide in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation my son is going through, all that he has been through since he came back, you know very well the effects that the TEPT and other wounds have on the families of our soldiers, you know very well what they are going through,” he said to the crowd that gathered in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other veterans of war that "they come back hardened, asking themselves if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and interference with a domestic violence complaint, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to get a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new US policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for a refugee applicant who is facing the current directive, according to NBC News.
The ACLU has not revealed the full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed in August 2017 against the federal government.
He said his friend "and his sons, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied his asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing the states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum requests to the U.S., as nations that face generalized problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA, for its English acronym) that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum in this country if they were fleeing domestic violence.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made some statements on Friday in which he said the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum requests must be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the individual case and not on the basis of a general policy.
In addition, the lawyers said in the letter that the policy that denies entry to immigrants hurts the economy of the U.S. by asserting that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and "are a necessary workforce."
The US Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to deny asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
The Trump administration has announced that it will allow asylum seekers to apply for protection in the United States if they fear persecution or threats to their lives because of their race, religion, nationality or political opinion.
The asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of dead increases in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her sick baby in a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce.
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for whatever belongings they can salvage.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals are also damaged due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested in the outside of the Army Hospital in Palu, where they were treated outside the building due to the continuous aftershocks, also very strong.
He couldn't help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he lived through while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall that collapsed, I think," Haris told AP. He and his family were in Palermo to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're well.
The US ambassador to China accuses China of bullying with propaganda announcements
A week after a Chinese official newspaper placed a four-page ad in an American newspaper touting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most-read newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 elections in the US Congress, something China denies vehemently.
The accusation that Trump launched against Beijing over its alleged attempt to influence the US elections marked a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publicize their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led to both sides increasing tariffs on imports from each other.
The compensatory tariffs China applied at the beginning of the trade war were designed to fall on exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China is intensifying its pressure on us with advertisements in our free press.
To spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by trying to place an ad in the Des Moines Register.
But in the newsstand where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few voices that disagree and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that their economy is taking, because the media is controlled by the firm pressure of the Communist Party of China.
He added that one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish the article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many Republicans of note are closing ranks behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that this could lead to a backlash, especially among women, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed their desire to continue with the vote.
“In this kind of case, you can’t go back,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, to The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm voters who are upset about this issue.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow, or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered outside the Senate were chanting "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) as the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is way beyond all predictions," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, at the site of news.
People say that the impact is already very relevant and, in fact, that is so.
But it could be even greater, especially among the indecisive women from the outskirts and the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who don't usually vote but don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony in which she detailed her allegations of sexual abuse against Kavanaugh, analysts said it could happen if Republicans pressed ahead with the confirmation.
This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as reported by NBC News early last week.
“It’s not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote, it’s also about how they’ve handled this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic group that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who are on Kavanaugh's side.
In a new YouGov poll, 41% of respondents say they believe Ford's testimony definitively or probably, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh's testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same of Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is investigating the Ford allegations as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, who told The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was 17.
On the other hand, Ramirez said the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is putting together a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the technology legend. A company that is based on the open source code platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world."
He said, "It has to be now."
It's a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid technology to allow users to create their own "personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is exclusive to online personal data storage is that the user decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data"
The idea of Inrupt, according to its director general, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and the skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
For now, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform IBM bought, some of the developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said his team is not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they will introduce or not a radical change where all their business models are completely modified from one day to the next.
“We’re not going to ask permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate over the neutrality of the Internet.
Even though Berners-Lee is launching Inrupt, he will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee said he was "incredibly optimistic" about the next era of the web.
Bernard Vann: the priest who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only English priest to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years after his death.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received this decoration on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under intense fire from machine guns and artillery."
He then ran into the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking out three of the detachment.
The lieutenant colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was an honor for him to be able to take part in the parade and added that "the true heroism of a real hero is shown when he is shown such a strong support."
The MMA fans were up all night for the Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig
Imagine that he stays up all night to watch the Bellator 206 so that at the end they don't let him see the main event.
The San José cartel had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, the British viewers were left stunned when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people weren't surprised after having to stay up until the early morning to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a joke that's gone too far"
There is a government regulation that regulates what can be broadcast from 6 a.m. on, so they had to change to the children's programming schedule.
"Peppa the pig", yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they will change the program to include British viewers in the next editions.
When I think about the option of live transmission, I think it can work.
But it's 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
I'm telling you, when the programming changed, we received a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise you that it won't happen again.
We'll reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, which is what we normally do. We tried to give more than usual to make the fans happy and we passed.
It's a very unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior because of his sexuality, but this was what motivated him to become a winner.
At 24, he told us that he didn't realize it until he got to high school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in talking about gay rights was to transmit "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to put less importance on winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this legendary program, Kirsty Young, will be absent for some months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne, Daley, who appeared to be a loner, commented that he felt inferior to the rest of the kids during his childhood because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like kids and girls."
He said: "I've always felt inferior and different, and that's what has given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to show that he was "something", he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games this year held in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told the police because he was living in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to transmit that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said it was a surprise to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, who is 20 years younger, though he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you live so much from such a young age” (he was 14 when he first competed in the Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone your age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have been about 'I have to win a gold medal'."
But you know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie.
His son is named Robert, after his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and in fact one of the last things he asked was if they had the tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him I couldn’t be in the first row,” he said.
“He had his hand on mine when he stopped breathing and it was only when he stopped breathing that I realized he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This was also the inspiration for his first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him during the preparation for the Olympics. He still got goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was on the bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who was playing in the event to try to get a record 12th time, was beaten by Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he has been so many times for the United States, the five-time major champion had to settle for cheering on in some moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what ails him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even in the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough punishes errant shots.
And if the field isn't challenging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match of Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood in winning all four matches they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, had started off in such an impressive fashion, Mickelson's match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, but could say little more.
He understood perfectly the role he had today, he patted me on the back and said he would be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I didn't imagine him playing two games.
We thought there would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it would be.
He wants to be there, like the rest.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break the record of Nick Faldo for the most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a career that had never been matched so clearly by his individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, but Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, clever, he likes to mock others; he’s great to have on the team,” he explained.
I think the younger players have enjoyed having him as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It's more than just a game.
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, even with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish with their opponents' heels, winning by a minimum margin of 14½-13½.
“You keep reminding me that we had a great tournament in Valderrama; we also had one in Brookline and lost; we had one in Valderrama and won, but by a hair,” said Bjorn, pictured, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead it by a 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
The history will teach me and everyone else that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are on the board.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on our 12 players, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no more, no less, the best players in the world.
Proud of what his players have done on a very difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what's happening when things are going well, but when you're alone, you really test your golfing ability.
That's the message we have to send to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now it's time to leave your partner behind, go and get the best out of yourself.
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as pairs, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points on four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the spectrum in the last few days of those big tournaments and was part of the team that won at Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
“I remember every word,” he said when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-importants tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all advance in the same direction, all the pressure falls on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them think we were going to do something magical tomorrow.
We assigned Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and face off against Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I picked this group of kids in this order because I think they cover the whole route,” Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German battleship, postponed again
The new German frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it won't be until at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing cost, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that leads the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a statement by the newspaper Die Zeit to a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the delivery delayed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We know they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signals, very reduced.
Among other important characteristics, the vessels can be deployed for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power in the oceans) will be already outdated when they start to serve, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was in the news last year when the German Navy officially rejected putting the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Very little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors: half the crew that was on the old class Bremen frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship has an excessive weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons is twice as heavy as other ships of similar class that the Germans used in WWII.
In addition to the defective hardware, the overall cost of the project, including training the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed that he has reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), instead of the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that are being attributed to the new frigates are of special relevance in light of the recent warnings about the reduction in the power of the German navy.
In the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy is "losing ships capable of deploying".
The officer said the problem has been getting worse over time, because the old ships were decommissioned but not replaced.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new investigation, which has been carried out in the Highlands of Scotland, is trying to discover how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is expected that what is discovered will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano bats, as well as the brown long-eared bat and Daubenton's bat of the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
They will place special recording devices in strategic locations on the property to track the bats' activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyse the sounds picked up on the recordings to discover the frequency of calls from the bats and what species make them.
Then a report and a habitat map will be produced to create a detailed image of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, is hoping the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
With this information, the benefits of habitat management will be determined, such as the creation of meadows and how to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
The wind turbines and the electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind.
But, due to his nocturnal hunting habits, his ears are more useful than his eyes in achieving his goal.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocalization that locates ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
He has ten experts trained in the matter, who carry out regular surveys, inspections of nests and, in some cases, rescues.
The organization has opened the first and only bat reserve in Scotland in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The property's director, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and the right habitat.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand better what they need to develop.
It is important to check for bats before doing maintenance work inside the properties, as you could destroy a breeding colony accidentally and kill 400 females and young, which would mean wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their colonies.
The Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elisabeth Ferrell, has urged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we don't know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations as "fake news" and says people are "trying to get their name in the papers" at his expense.
His lawyers have been instructed to file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the statements.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping a woman from the United States, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying $375,000 to hide the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, trolled the report as "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball, looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It's the same old story.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but it's like that, I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," he added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations that appear in what they call "an unacceptable breach of privacy" according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, the player's lawyer, said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
It seems the supposed incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, supposedly, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to Ronaldo's room and there, according to the documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, he allegedly raped her anally.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt down after the supposed incident and told him that he was a "good boy" and that he had only disappointed him by a "one percent".
In the documents, Ronaldo confirms that he and the woman had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also says she went to the police and they took pictures of her wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was afraid of "retaliation" and worried about being "humiliated in public."
The woman, 34, says she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has changed to Juventus, a big name in Italian football with a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: the UK would regret losing car manufacturers forever
The UK would "regret it for the rest of its life" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the UK's Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would be temporarily halted at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of Brexit delays at customs could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My opinion is that, if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production problems in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, general director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed their fears in relation to the exit of the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the problems that could arise in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is based on the "just in time" method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it could cause a disruption at the border, according to the sector, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in such a case, production would stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan, which sets out the future relationship with the EU, is "tuned to perfection to avoid those border controls".
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow us to get out of this situation well and take advantage of the opportunity.
Toyota's evidence is that we have to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a tremendously successful supply chain.
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, in the end, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union representative at the plant, said his members were becoming increasingly worried: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that sets out our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be postponed another week, as the dispute over the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, links between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not and, in this way, compromise the independence of Mueller has fueled the gossip in Washington for months.
In early June, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein secretly recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone he carried himself in order to try to remove the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it.
However, on Monday he was at the White House, where news reports said he was about to resign.
Instead, he announced a meeting with Trump (who was at the United Nations in New York at the time) for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We'll decide on the spot and I'll be informing the press as I usually do.
Some journalists would refute that: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the scarcity of press wheels was not due to a dislike of TV reporters who act grandiloquently, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they fanfaronade."
Next, she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The president holds more press conferences than any other president before him, he said, citing "unsubstantiated" figures.
Press briefings will continue, said Sanders, but "if the press has the option of asking directly to the president of the United States, I think it's much better than asking me.
We have tried to do this many times and you have seen us do this many times in the last weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can speak with the president of the United States."
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him are rare.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why he was so popular, where he made an uncharacteristic and sometimes bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish Government writes to NHS workers in Scotland about their fears over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the staff of the EU Health Service working in the HHS of Scotland to express their gratitude for their work and their desire for them to continue working with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens who work in public services that are not dependent on the central government.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union were held on the exit, which was expected to take place this autumn.
However, the British government has also intensified its preparations for a scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know this must be very confusing for you.
And that is why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each and every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over Europe and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue counting on you.
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head wound
Christian Abercrombie, a player for the Tennessee State Tigers was operated on in an emergency after suffering a head injury on Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennesse.
The coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the press that the injury occurred just before the break.
He came to the band and collapsed there.
The coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A member of the Vanderbilt staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding up to 18 tackles for the whole season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher rate of stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to provide shelter for the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The change will neutralize the success Corbyn has achieved in attracting younger voters
The increase in the transmission of real estate tax will be applied to those people who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year which will be used to help the homeless.
The additional money raised by the increase in the stamp duty on foreign buyers of UK property will be used to help the homeless, said Theresa May.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises to provide more affordable housing for young voters and to harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in the transmission tax on properties will be levied on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to incentivize the government's policy to combat begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is an additional tax on transmissions, also includes the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, which could reach up to 3 %.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of new homes in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which causes the prices to rise and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder.
Many of the wealthiest areas of the country (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping prices very high by buying up land without any intention of using it and urged the Sra. May to eliminate the fees that are applied to affordable homes to solve the "shameful problem of housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, among which are controls on rent and the end of evictions without cause.
He also proposes giving local governments more powers to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the working class in Britain.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland manager says his "primary objective" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scot, 42, is excited about the possibility of reviving the club from the north-east, which at the moment occupies third place in the League One (the third division of English football), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat, he said on Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it's always been something I've wanted to do.
This opportunity will only become reality, however, if I can lead a club to success.
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Athletic Bilbao says he felt no fear when he moved to a club as big as Celtic, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League,”
because the structure and facilities of this club correspond to those of the Premier League, without a doubt.
“It’s not easy to get here, but I’d consider I’d achieved my objective here when I can return the club to where it belongs.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after being an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell as technical director at Hearts.
After that, he helped the Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and made the St. Mirren avoid relegation and win the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalled when he took over the Alloa.
I always thought that the direction was what I did best, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, but I was good at it and I could make a living from it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I have done it, this is the time of my adult life when I have felt better, without a doubt.
You can listen to the whole interview on Sportsound on Monday, September 30, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 on a Saturday.
The heatwave has boosted sales at British pubs, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
The pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8%, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy firm CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have meant that in July the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased by 2.8%, has been maintained, while restaurants have even fallen a little more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their best month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced their profits.
The pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered, although not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people only want to go out to drink.
In bars and pubs managed by the Mafia, sales of drinks rose 6.6% during the month, while sales of meals fell 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April."
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events are still the most important factors in terms of sales in the market for activities outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurants are still fighting, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful given the continuing pressures on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, which reflects the slow decline in the number of new brand openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK's restaurant, bar and pub sector, data is collected and analysed for 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9bn and is the market reference value.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media sites that their parents don't know about
One in five children (some even as young as 11) have secret accounts on social media sites that their parents and teachers don't know about, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a growth in the number of fake Instagram pages
The news has sharpened fears that the content will be published
20% of the students said they had a "main" account that shows their parents
One in five children (some even as young as 11) create secret social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news has sharpened fears that explicit sexual content will be published.
20% of the students said they had a "main" account that showed their parents, while at the same time having other private accounts.
A mother who happened to find her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw a teenager encouraging others to "violate" her.
The investigation, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland and his president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want to see sport benefit from his great experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish athletics community, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from her involvement in the sport's governance.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help to develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and now is a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him temporarily unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell if I would recover or how much I would recover.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I had to learn to walk again and I'm now doing agility exercises.
Thanks for the messages and words of encouragement!
The announcement of the breast pump where it is compared to mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A breast-pump company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares mothers who breast-feed with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what the company claims is the "world's first silent breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music that shows mothers talking about the freedom they feel with the new breast pump.
Four real women dance in a barn full of hay, along with cows, with signs like: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues to say: "Feed them, feed them, I'm feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I'm feeding my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has created a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it puts the focus on the horrors of the dairy sector.
A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
As we do, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after giving birth.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly fitted into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Terrifying for the mother and the baby."
But, why not use them to announce a breast pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a crazy ad."
However, other people defended the announcement, like a woman who admitted that the song was "destructive".
I think it's a great idea.
If he were still sucking, he'd have one.
I felt like a cow when I used the bomb.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but I don't give it any more thought.
It's a great product”, said a woman.
Another person told us: "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows."
In the ad, no praise or criticism of the dairy sector is made.
In the end video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside their brassieres.
The campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump their milk with a breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, it has no cables or tubes, and it is discreetly attached to the nursing bra, which makes it possible for its users to move, hold their babies, and even go out with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, social and ECD of Mother, comments: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch."
By showing the parallel between expressive women and milk cows, we wanted to call attention to the use of milk-producing bombs and their challenges, while also demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new bomb offers.
This is not the first time Elvie has appeared in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minors discreetly sent to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied minors detained has increased significantly, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has remained at the usual levels. In part, this is due to the harsh rhetoric and the policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are making it more difficult to sponsor these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would put their own stay in the country in jeopardy.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godfathers and other adult family members would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal records.
Around 80% of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we are still pursuing these people,” said Albence.
In their rush to prosecute minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum of one month from the time of arrest, instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to workers at the centers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status in immigration cases.
Those who are not considered eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers at the centers and the reports from the system that have emerged in the last few months, the longer they are held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
As the defenders point out, these concerns are even more acute in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of distress in these children will be overlooked.
In addition, the transfer to the camp without having given them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them to suffer a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria asks the occupying forces of the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the vice prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly."
“They must withdraw immediately and without conditions,” he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism" in Syria is practically over, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorists and any foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the topic of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "seeding irrational fears" that made them decide to stay outside the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters, which would be "eradicated."
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura is expected to call soon for the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to draft a new constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for Syrian participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are sure to expect, a resignation or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would be without a doubt "The most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!"
There are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC have doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million during prime time.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime-time audience, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has surpassed the ratings of cable news channels with 3.5 million viewers for its main news programs at night.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t understand,” Neal Baer, the show’s executive producer, tells us. “Designated Survivor” is a drama about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell, who has written for "Seinfeld" and "Mad About You," has another theory.
Remember a trip he took in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?
“Because it makes me laugh,” was the response Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of families of immigrants being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources that Woodward used for his book "Fear" -- the $15,000 ostrich jacket of Paul Manafort ("a piece of over-the-top vanity," in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's scathing descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never look at Mario the same way again.
“Offering something new every night is part of what makes it seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars,” when we talk about the alternating cast of Trump and his daily plot twists (whether he’s fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to get left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't tear himself away from the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss says.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.”

The money from abroad flows in the mid-term elections of the most adjusted House of Representatives
It's no surprise that money is flowing into the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the reorganization of a congressional district with two candidates seeking reelection to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, which was recently redesigned, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another Republican candidate for reelection, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding battle between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
The name of Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although after a while it backed off
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Trump Organization kicked them out.
The State Department decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan, said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, the development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for Central America and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the meetings progressed, American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials in the administration made clear that their intention was to keep the conference going, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a signal of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three US envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new threats or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman rejected the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there are already many public indications.
It is thought Mueller is also investigating the possibility that Trump's campaign was working in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable by that chamber, just as he prepares to run for president again, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional clauses, and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that his European equivalents are doomed.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All they needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The story revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans now face several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good position since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to serve in the office.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation the F.B.I. has requested on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these exams, we will be facing a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we won't fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that had once occupied my ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home against the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
We got a good point, because Villarreal is a good team, said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing we could get something and we ended up with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but, in general, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and we were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the previous game. But, with all the support from the fans, I am sure we can advance and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now it seems like everything will be okay.
The team is doing well, the boys are enjoying themselves a lot and we are having a good training session.
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind us and achieve success.
The fear of retirement savings is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their families.
Around half of the people who took part in the Nationwide survey said they did talk to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this.
“People want to be cared for by a relative, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare them to care for you if you don't tell them in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to get treatment, because that can be a determining factor in the cost.
Include in the conversion to his financial advisor, since he can also help him find a way to pay for those expenses.
His options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover his expenses or to insure himself with his own savings, as long as he has the money.
Negotiate his legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Take care of getting a power of attorney to designate a person of trust to supervise his medical care and to make sure that the professionals comply with his wishes in case he cannot communicate.
He can also prepare a power of attorney for his finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could he answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
“It’s not just about money: what doctors do you have to treat?” asks Martin.
What medications is he taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned out.
Several shots are fired at a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They shot a man with a rifle as he was walking home after leaving the house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which happened around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have made an appeal for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said. It is expected that the death toll will rise.
With communications blocked, the officials of the disaster relief agency have been unable to get any information from the regency of Donggala, a northern area of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palermo, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The Regency, which is a hierarchical administrative region inferior to the province, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a zone of great seismic activity, and suffers frequent earthquakes.
Next, we summarize some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A great earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and took the lives of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
There were hundreds of victims in Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 tsunami and earthquake.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: Lombok Island, a tourist island in Indonesia, was hit by a series of earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
The son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away.
Palin has been ordered to be held in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held without bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, according to the channel.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and pay a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a Class B misdemeanor, with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Sarah Palin's mother called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska veterans court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence complaint, and possessing a firearm while intoxicated, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend said she punched him in the face.
Several veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking the violent behavior of her son to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communications networks have collapsed and it is expected that the death toll will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just to the side of the Sulawesi center, which is located in the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived at the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in the New York City subway bombing
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October 31 attack on a bike path in the West Side of Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of a criminal enterprise, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of destruction of a motor vehicle.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, the warning states.
Five of the victims were Argentines.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal execution in New York was that of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This couple was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electrocution on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked that the flag of ISIS be raised in his hospital room, said the police.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a life sentence without the possibility of parole will prolong the trauma for all those involved in these events,” said Patton.
The defense team for Saipov had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UKIP said politicians had to "feel the heat" of the euro-sceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would have left the EU by now if Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Theresa May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more when a group of Tories in favour of staying in the EU joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers plan on its feet in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that he would continue trying to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between his package and chaos.
The Leave Means Leave MP said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile."
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also there, where she told reporters: "I'm just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people."
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said to the concentrated that it would be necessary to "feel the heat" if the politicians were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it's a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class feel the heat."
“We will mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the supporters of the stay marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists waved placards against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
The Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the problems they had with an application for the party's conference.
“These are the same people who tell us they can implement the IT systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider all possibilities after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There has been a lot of speculation about Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday was his 30th town hall meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
A secretary asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.
An arrest was made in the murder of LSU football player Tyrone Sims
The Baton Rouge police department announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the campus of Southern University at first light on Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death,” said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98m tall player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Bottas qualified ahead of Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' orders would play a key role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton out of the race by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first into the pits and left Hamilton running in the slipstream, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out with a strong push on the next lap and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton got ahead after a move with the wheels almost touching that made Vettel have to give up the inside line at risk of being overtaken after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first race.
He then led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered the pits on lap 44, but he could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to recover the fourth position.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman by letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect pair.
That's a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia Occidental, the president did not mention directly the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are "bad, repulsive and false people."
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false,” he said.
“When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say “But I didn't do it.”
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Did you leak it?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it.
Well, wait a minute.
Have we leaked it? No, we haven't leaked it,” he said while imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and denied that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and, therefore, I did.”
But his refusal didn't sit well with the president, who during his Saturday night rally said, "I'm telling you, that was a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't do it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court nominee who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get power and control, according to the president, as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for their Friday night defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match on Saturday by 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants took an early lead thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the game before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams, of which the Giants won the three previous games.
The first goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In a very lively first period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game in the 13:10 mark before Matt Marquardt tied the game with a Cownie assist in the 15:16 mark.
Dwyer ensured the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the second half and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as the game approached the final whistle.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
A traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane during the earthquake
A traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people died and many more are missing after a massive earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to batter the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu. The tower was being affected by a strong sway.
He remained firm to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that moment, could take off safely.
He jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims will continue to rise, as there are still many bodies under the rubble and we have not been able to contact many people,” says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Tsunamis that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies."
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is trying to help as many survivors as possible, but we don't know what we'll find there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the army of his country: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in the first half of this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared after saying that all 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated safely from the plane as it sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening it could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
“That's extremely good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to advance through water that reached their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said that the passengers panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said the sailors who were working on some repairs at a pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the aviation security network indicates that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A forensic analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office concluded its arguments in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The Justice Department's Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the phone records to tie the movements of Quinton Tellis, the accused, and Jessica Chambers, the victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Chambers' phone had been with Lo Piccolo's phone during the time Lo Piccolo said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck of Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
The phone records showed they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers's death, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
“He wiped her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be decided by the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says hip hop has moved away from its original messages of political and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Interpreters like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her after she sent them a racist text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discrimination after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies that it is racist and compares the lawsuit with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her consternation when she discovered that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON”, wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his former nanny, who was black, had done a poor job and that instead he was expecting a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for a day's work and sent it home in Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the firing with the intention of receiving a compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for which he had been hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them that things don’t happen this way,” he told The Post on Friday and added, “I know this is a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racists by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after having offended her.
“My wife had sent him something he didn't want to say.”
She's not racist.
We're not racists,” said Joel Plasco to the Post.
“Would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?”
To your newborn?
Come on!
Comparing the demand as an extortion, Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to go after someone like that?”
That's not very decent,” said the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public opinion has already condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and their logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who was reading it for the first time before its publication."
It's funny to know now what we know about Paddington's great success.
He said his father, who had worked as a camera operator for the BBC before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the children's book, was confident his work would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was very proud of her success.
He was a very calm man who didn't like to boast.
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you were proud of him, even though it wasn't really your achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“He called regularly to say things were really bad, that he didn't think he'd make it,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
After that I received a call from Nad to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said: "Tashi, I love you very much."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were running out and his system was shutting down.
She had died too soon and everything was going out.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
He couldn't scream, cry or shout because he was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep my ground.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was happening.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
I bent my head and the tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad on the flight.
I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning put up cards to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any place.
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm always worried about the consequences."
Davis created the cards "so that people know there are people to talk to and with whom you can talk, even if they are friends.
Don't keep quiet, you have to talk about it.
The woman, who is a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“He didn't say he was depressed or anything like that,” he says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.”
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to get over it: "It leaves a void in the whole family."
He left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs by a thread as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited investigation in time, a limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going off the rails” in the middle of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican partisans not want the FBI investigation to take place?
His refusal is totally due to the chronology.
Five weeks remain until the mid-term elections on November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans have a bad showing, their attempts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of North Korean deserters "fall" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by human traffickers, have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
Most of the deserters from the north are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected DMZ between the two Koreas.
China considers desertors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and, in many cases, they are repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
In the first week of May, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on U.S. sanctions.
“Without the trust of the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histrionic" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said Brett Kavanaugh was a "histrionic" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin (Texas).
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted like that, they would have said she was hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also condemned explicitly the Democrats, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated defamations" organized by some liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against Democrats.
I think he's shooting himself in the foot with those statements and the way he's pursued the Clintons and Democrats.
Pelosi put her objections when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed in the case and if the Democrats won the majority in the House.
“I will only say one thing: if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he will not be fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court he is on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible rulings of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, which is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to think everything is fine,” Pelosi said.
And women have to pick it up.
It's a justified rant, it's been months and years of fury overflowing, and she can't let it go without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
“I don't think that's so strange, right?”
He continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to: "Maybe you think I'm crying because I'm sad."
No, I'm not angry.
And then he continued with what he was doing.
I thought it was great.
Crying is allowed as a way to let out anger, but it's not really understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once when I found myself crying with an unexpressed rage. An older woman, a serious manager I had always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
They have no idea how angry you are.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they've cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business, she had to withdraw from the presidential race. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of her running for president.
“It wasn't a well-thought-out decision,” he said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and they didn't need another one.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the campaign was already well underway, he stayed behind in the fundraising, so he promised that he would not run again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, only gave her $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?”, he wondered.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on capturing voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
“It would have been logical to think he had had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
Did he cry?
The trade war between the US and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although there is still much to be done, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning in January by imposing tariffs on the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs that affect $200 billion (150 billion pounds sterling) in goods, which will add taxes to half of the goods that enter the US from China.
In all cases, Beijing has taken retaliatory measures, applying tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pledged to match the attacks of the U.S., and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon ease up.
To back down would mean ceding to Washington's demands, but submitting to the US publicly would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the trade war with the US could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could make the difference between a free fall in the economy in either country is in fact much more dangerous than what the spectators have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, associate fellow at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to welcome back refugees, says the foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to take back refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is still trying to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their means of living.
The UN estimates that, since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still six million people in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said Syria would be grateful for the help to rebuild the country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional help or the help of countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup of 2018 by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now lost six consecutive matches on European soil since its last victory in the Ryder Cup in 1993.
Europe reclaimed the Ryder Cup when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team won 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, admitted defeat on the 16th hole, a par 3, conceding his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to ever achieve a 5-0-0 in the current format of the tournament since it began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth lost to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen, 5 and 4.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European player with the most victories in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have recovered the cup.
It's a team effort and I'm very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now it's Rahm's turn to carry the torch. He beat the legend Tiger Woods on Sunday in a match play duel, 2 and 1.
I feel incredible pride at having beaten Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching this man.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his career in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting."
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we ruined it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now it's our turn to bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.
