Members of the Assembly (AM, for its English name) in Wales are concerned that they appear to be muppets
Some Members of the Assembly are surprised by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, by its English name).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party in the House of Commons said that the phrase “rims with Twp and Pwp” was “unacceptable”.
For readers outside Wales: Twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that the whole group was unhappy with the decision and had suggested alternative options.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was open to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation difference between MWP and muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire.
The Commission on Legislation, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, declares: “By definition, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Assembly will be the matter of the members of the Assembly”.
The Welsh Assembly Act 2017 granted the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation that revealed a broad support for calling the Welsh Assembly to Parliament.
On the question of the title of the Assembly Members, the Commission chose Members of the Welsh Assembly (or WMP), but the MWP received the majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could lead to a row with the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the draft bill on changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on inhabilitation of Assembly Members and the design of committees.
The members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of how the name should be called when they deliberate on legislation.
Macedonians cast ballots in referendum on changing the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether the country's name is to be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has consistently insisted on the name of its northern neighbour's claim to its territory and in multiple occasions has opposed its application for membership in the European Union and the NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is merely a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent because the churches in Harlem are difficult to reach
“Historically, people who I have spoken to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner.”
“Today, there is no difference between the two.
The disappearance of the bars was understandable.
Now people socialize in a different way.
“The bars are no longer the hubs of social interaction in the neighbourhoods.
He is concerned that money raised from the sale of church property will not last as long as the leaders expect it to.
Churches, he said, could be replaced by apartments filled with people who would not help the shelters that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, and, therefore, accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a major city: the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's Church in 1910.
The white church congregation left the church in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped in the building.
A Black congregation took the reins of San Martín, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street shopping district's merchants, a major shopping district in Harlem, which resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire damaged the building and, while the congregation was making plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor, the Reverend David Johnson, called him the "campaign of the poor".
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it a cultural treasure and a historical relic.
And the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, said that it was the first carillon in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the larger Riverside Church carillon for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said that San Martín did not replace him.
The situation in San Martín has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought by the leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the parish governing body, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese was trying to pass the costs on to the parish council, even though the parish council had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
Tiburon kills a 13-year-old boy who was diving for sharks in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old swimmer in California on the day the langostí season opened, according to authorities.
The attack took place at about 7:00 a.m. on Sunday, July 1, 2010, at Encinitas Beach.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were diving with a child when they heard the child begging for help, so they went over to help him.
Hammel said he was surprised to discover that the spider had bitten him, but he was happy to have caught a lobster.
I had a broken clavicle.
I shouted to all to get out of the water because there was a shark.
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species responsible for the shark attack is unknown.
The lifeguard, Larry Giles, said in a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered dangerous.
Giles said the victim had traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed the access to the beach, from Ponto Beach to Swami Beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for safety reasons.
Giles said there were 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them were not considered dangerous.
The Sainsbury's Beauty Plan is pushing the beauty industry in the UK
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff in their department stores.
To boost the UK beauty market, valued at £2800 billion and rising in comparison with the decline in fashion and household goods, the largest beauty hallways will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be expanded to more stores in the next year.
Investment in beauty flows into the same space as that used for televisions, microwaves and kitchenware.
Sainsbury's announced that it would double its beauty offerings, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Additionally, the company will expand its existing product lines, including L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with similar product lines to those in other stores.
The company also plans to launch a new line of skincare products that are more friendly with animals, something that is becoming increasingly important to the company's customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be opening a store in Croydon, in the south of London, the first of its kind in the UK, in the coming weeks.
The online shopping and the shift towards daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores forces retailers to make an effort to convince customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury’s, has said that shops will look more like supermarkets as the chain tries to compete with discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has integrated discount stores in hundreds of Argos stores and introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is believed that these acquisitions have boosted the sales of food and made it more profitable for the Habitats stores.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a disagreement over how to split the pharmaceutical sales in their supermarkets.
The new strategy is based on the sale of the 281 Sainsbury's pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, in 2013 for 125 million pounds.
It is indicated that Lloyds will be participating in the plan, adding a wider range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to its portfolio.
As Sainsbury's has transformed the appearance and environment of its beauty department, so that it enhances the environment for our customers.
We have also hired a specialist to help us with the implementation of the new rules.
Our brand portfolio is designed to fit all needs.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby breaks an agreement with him
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, was “furious” after Holly Willoughby broke a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for fashion and accessories.
This business had compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The host of This Morning, 37-year-old Jessica Stevenson, has announced her departure from the show.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of the UK’s most successful lifestyle brand, by leaving her lucrative lifestyle business behind to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources consulted, Jones was furious when the gold girl of television admitted that her new deals, valued at up to £1.5 million, did not leave time for her fashion and accessories brand Truly, her own business empire, to be run during a tightly scheduled meeting at her Buckinghamshire headquarters.
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business, Jones left for a vacation home in Spain.
Truly, he was the main priority of Holly.
I was going to be her future, which would have lasted for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all the participants stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, right next door to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow, ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment in products such as coffee mugs and clothing, and possibly delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been in a relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the new face of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
No se habló de temas empresariales.
A conversation difficult to understand.
He was laughing about the press criticism he received for making a joke about North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.
Why has President Trump withdrawn from the Paris Agreement?
Trump said he would like to see the United States and Mexico working together to solve the issue of illegal immigration.
I have not given up on anything.
He said he was interested in meeting with Kim again after the first meeting in June in Singapore, which he said was a great step towards the nuclear weapons-free zone in North Korea.
However, the nuclear disarmament talks have stalled.
After three months of the June summit in Singapore, the main diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the leaders of the world gathered in the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country was not getting an adequate response from the United States to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
The United States, on the other hand, has continued to impose economic sanctions on Cuba.
The president's speech was much more optimistic than usual.
We have a great relationship with North Korea.
We were going to enter into a war with North Korea.
There would have been many deaths.
We have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with North Korea have yielded positive results: the end of the missile tests, the release of American hostages and the return of American soldiers' remains.
He also defended his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be the president, but that’s not how it works. Instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this stadium, we would have 200 people here.
A tsunami and a major earthquake devastates an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, NGOs were reported to be asked to cease their activities.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had to flee, there was no declaration of a national emergency, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
“I regrettably, in many cases they have made it clear that they do not request international assistance, which makes it a little bit more difficult to get things done.
Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, but they do not know if foreign staff can work on the ground.
The national emergency management agency spokesman Sutopo said that the situation in Palu was being evaluated to see if international aid organisations could be allowed to help.
The earth moves constantly in Indonesia, and the country is still extremely unprepared when the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions erupt.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common elsewhere.
It is likely that the apparent lack of warning sirens for a tsunami in Palu, even though there was a warning earlier, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of the cases, travelling from island to island in Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate logistics.
A ship hospital was sent to Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake, but it will take at least three days to reach Palu.
President Joko Widodo has made improving the worn-out infrastructure of Indonesia his central campaign theme, and has committed a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is standing for re-election in the next election.
It also faces the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where a majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative faith.
Over 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, ties the score with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to about 27 m from the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot and kicked it to the second post.
The ball went over the net and landed in the corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
“I was trying to get into that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play a lot forward, so I gave them all the time I could.
“I saw Kante coming and I gave him a touch. He was a bit late, but I wasn’t surprised.”
Chelsea was leading 1-0 at half-time after Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The midfielder made a pass to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before turning and spinning near the halfway line, before entering the Liverpool camp.
Kovacic ran the ball and ran out of the field.
Then, Hazard made a pass to the space that took him to the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and kicked the ball into the net with a left foot shot that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
The Liverpool FC plays against the Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday, March 15th, at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium, in Naples (Italy).
The Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and which generated waves of up to six metres, according to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man accused of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found dead at 7:55 am on Sunday morning in Grayson Mews, in John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect in her death.
Police have asked people in the area to contact the police.
The Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was near John Street, Birkenhead, and had seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has captured something on camera that they should contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and that she was found in the interior of a property.
This afternoon some people who believe to know the victim arrived at the crime scene to find out where she had been.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have informed the victim's family of the investigation.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to return to his flat, but the police say he can't enter or leave the building.
He was perplexed when he discovered what had happened.
Now, residents are permitted to return to their homes.
Somebody heard a man tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene.
It is terrible.
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were parked outside the school.
Many people were standing outside the block of flats, watching the police and ambulance services.
Anyone with information should contact the Commissioner at DM @ Merpol CC, call the 101 or contact Crimestoppers at the number 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament Square is now the last of its kind
His banning would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by his fanatical followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestion as a “madness” and an “attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “It was inevitable that the debate over the removal of Cromwell’s statue from Westminster Hall would become an objective.
English: 
It may be that the wrong Cromwell sacrificed himself for the deeds of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a testimony to the opinion of the nineteenth century and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider deserving of celebration.
As the Sunday Telegraph pointed out, Cromwell was perceived by some as a defender of parliament in the nineteenth century, and by others as a defender of the monarchy.
If the description is completely accurate, then the debate is over.
It is certainly true that the mid-17th century conflict gave rise to the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable face of that division.
His achievements as Protector are to be celebrated and commemorated.
A pig attacked a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in the southwest of China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a cut artery and covered in blood near a pigsty at the market of Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm in Xining, in the province of Qinghai (China).
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and discovered the door to the pigsty was open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a big pig with a bloody mouth.
The post-mortem examination confirmed that the pig weighed almost 250 kg and had died from his injuries.
“His legs were bloody and smashed,” said the cousin, who was known by his courtesy name, “Wu.”
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour after the crash.
The animal that killed the man was not a dog nor was it his nephew.
A market manager reported to The Evening News that the pig was kept in a cage to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
It seems that the family of Yuan and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, pigs can attack people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a hog was trapped in a tractor by a cow.
After a group of pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba declared to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but blood can act as a “trigger”.
They're just playing.
They are like children, very curious.
What to do is to respect them.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, heavy rainfall is expected in the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa caused winds of 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. (Eastern time) on Sunday and was located about 620 km (360 mi) southwest of Eugenia (Mexico).
The expected date of the arrival of the ship is Sunday, March 31.
While southeast of the Pacific Ocean are starting to form low pressure areas, which are moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday, a tropical storm will start to push the intense tropical rainfall in a northwest direction, towards the southwest of the United States.
Rain will fall more than 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain hits the low pressure system, heavy rainfall will be expected in the southwestern United States.
Between 2 and 10 inches of rain will cause flooding, mudslides, landslides, and possible landslides.
Tropical storms will cause heavy rainfall of 5–8 cm/hr in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Forecasters expect between 5 and 10 inches of rain in the southwest, especially in the major part of Arizona.
Because of the dispersed nature of the tropical rains, it is possible that flash floods will occur quickly and quickly worsen.
For this threat of torrential tropical rains, it is advised not to venture into the desert.
The heavy rains could turn rivers into rivers and storms will cause winds and dust clouds.
The low pressure system that is approaching the coast of Southern California will produce heavy rainfall in specific areas.
Moderate to heavy rainfall could cause up to two inches of rain, which could cause small mudslides and make roads slippery.
The first heavy rains of the rainy season in the region would be expected to begin in the first week of June.
Some tropical storms may scatter some showers over Arizona on Sunday and Monday, before rain begins to fall on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be some intense temperature changes in the United States because of the Arctic cooling and the tropics warming.
At times, this can lead to changes in temperature in short distances.
An example of these differences is what will happen in the entire United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of nearly 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and between St. Louis and Des Moines.
The summer heat will slowly subside and return to normal.
In a large part of the central and eastern United States, warm weather is expected to begin in October, with temperatures ranging from 26 °C in the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
Tuesday, temperatures could reach 26 °C, 12 °C above the average.
Our forecast for long-term weather for the eastern United States indicates high chances of warm weather during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing
More than 20 million people watched the shocking testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of rape in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political situation continued to be deadlocked and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest Friday's news: a design by Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her and tried to strip her naked in a party at an undergraduate college.
I am absolutely convinced that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20 million people have seen the video.
The company counted the average viewership for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not available immediately for broadcast on other channels, such as PBS, CNN and Fox Business Network.
The company also has a problem with the number of people who see something in the office.
It is a very different kind of audience.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, was the number one cable news network, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a 24-hour period.
ABC was in second place, with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in the Friday's show.
After the Republican moderate office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the morning of Friday, January 6, 2018, cameras from CNN and CBS captured how protesters shouted at him when he tried to climb into an elevator to attend a hearing on the Judiciary Committee.
While receiving these reproaches, they were simultaneously being broadcast live on CNN.
I was looking at you, and I was thinking, “How can I be so blind to this?”
“Do you believe that he is telling the truth to the country?”
You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator closed, he would be giving more information in his testimony before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
Cable and broadcast television networks aired everything live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Senate to be voted on.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the following week, which had been requested by some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part by conversations he had had with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
The decision of Flake was crucial, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
The president Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh.
May accuses critics of 'political' criticism of the EU's Brexit deal
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “doing politics” with the future of Britain and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, he insisted on his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for the brexit, saying that a proposal for the UK and the EU to charge tariffs on each other was “totally absurd”.
Dyteon Simpson is arrested as suspect in the murder of Wayde
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a public video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene of the crime and said they had DNA evidence on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted shooting Wayde.
The court has established a $350,000 bond, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge East District Court Judge published a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a gunshot wound to the head.
The department acknowledges the merits of the Fugitive Unit of the Louisiana State Police, the Criminal Investigation Laboratory of the Louisiana State University, and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's Director of Athletics, appreciated the police's diligence and search for justice.
Simpson was 20 years old.
The player, who was more than two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had a mean score of 5.6 and 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was “devastated” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
These are the things that always trouble people.
A volcano in Mexico City throws ash
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has been deposited in the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexican residents to stay away from the volcano after it showed activity and released 183 gases and ash in 24 hours.
The center recorded several earthquakes and earthquakes.
In social media, photos on Facebook and Twitter showed thin coat of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City's Xochimilco district.
Geophysicists have observed a greater earthquake activity at the volcano, located 72 km south of Mexico City, since a 7.1 earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", is active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists as they marched through Barcelona
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after anti-independence protesters clashed with police as tens of thousands of people took to the streets in a pro-independence protest.
A group of separatists who had been blocking the road were thrown eggs and powder at by angry mobs of protesters, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which normally are filled with tourists.
There were also violent clashes afterwards and police used batons.
During several hours, the separatist groups, with slogans such as “neither forgiveness nor forgiveness” clashed with unionist protesters, shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions are still high in this region one year after the illegal referendum, considered unlawful by Madrid but celebrated by separatists.
The voters chose for a large majority for independence, although turnout was low, as those who were against secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured in the course of the police trying to prevent the voting in polling stations in the whole region, where violent clashes broke out.
The groups who supported independence camped overnight to prevent a rally in support of the National Police.
The protest march continued, but the route was changed.
Narcis Termes, 68, a retired electrician who was at the protest, said he had no hope that Catalonia would break away from Spain.
The year last year we had one of our best years.
I saw my parents cry of joy at the news that they could now vote, but now we are stuck.
Despite achieving a narrow victory in the regional elections of December, pro-Catalanist parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, either in exile or in jail, are waiting for trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest on his phone, said the protest had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
The situation is getting more tense.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament in the upcoming elections in May.
To be a candidate for election to the European Parliament is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression by the Spanish Government.
Londonderry: men arrested for driving a car into a house
Three men, of 33, 34 and 39 years, have been arrested after repeatedly hitting a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday evening in Ballynagard Crescent.
The inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage had been caused to the access points and the building itself.
It is possible that a sniper has shot the car with a bow and arrow.
A tackle by the Livingston team gives them a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
The first goal by Dolly Menga for Livingston secured victory
A Livingston promoted impressed Rangers as Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager.
The Dolly Menga attack marked the difference. The Hibs team moved up a place, with the Hearts in second place.
This season, the Gerrards have yet to win any away games and the next match is against Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points ahead.
Before, the Rangers receive Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, the Livingston has extended its winning streak to six games. Holt, the interim coach, has not yet tasted defeat since he took over from Kenny Miler in late March.
Livingston is not a good candidate for the job.
The Holt team had to have gone ahead earlier than they did, causing a lot of problems for the Rangers by their direct play.
Scott Robinson overcame the defence, but his shot went wide. Alan Lithgow then missed the shot after he had run in to a Halkett cross.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with free kicks.
So it was as the goal scored that day.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston looked for a way through, with a Declan Gallagher and Robinson combination for Menga, who scored from the centre of the area.
In the first half, the Rangers were dominant in possession, but could not break the defence of the host, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was quite calm.
The game continued until the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a stoppage.
Allan McGregor, goalkeeper of the Rangers rejected a shot by Scott Pittman and Lithgow was far away from another one.
In the area of Livingston, passes were constantly being made, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were denied, one after a tackle on the substitute Glenn Middleton and another after a hand.
“Fantastic” from the Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the stadium
A great and rewarding performance and result.
The unanimous opinion is that they did a great job in making a game that was on the rise.
His style of play and his squad hasn't changed much since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt's recruitment of players from his arrival.
I had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was enormously effective and directed a well-organised defence, while Joe Worrall and Connor Goldston kept the two Connors on the edge of the penalty area all game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good moments with Gerrard, they were short.
They lacked materialising the plays, as they only managed to get into the opponent's half once, which is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Turkey has received a mixed reception in Berlin
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring the alliance ties between NATO allies.
The two leaders discussed human rights, press freedom and the accession of Turkey to the European Union.
After the prayer, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city welcomes the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police said security concerns were the reason for the police to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered outside to see their president.
There were also hundreds of protesters, mostly Kurds, who were outraged by Erdogan's policies and the decision of Germany to welcome him in the country.
These manifestations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, received as a hero by some Germans and considered an autocrat by others.
Crash in Deptford: A cyclist dies after collision with a car
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended by paramedics, but he died on the spot.
The accident occurred after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene in Childers Street, about two kilometres from the site of the accident on Saturday.
Police said they were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted.
Prison for six police officers after riots
Six prison officers have been injured in a prison of high security for men, according to the prison authority.
The riots started in the Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, at 9:30 on Sunday and continue.
A specialist team of a elite unit (called the Tornado) is handling the riots, in which eight inmates are involved and which are taking place in a prison.
The agents received assistance for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: "A specialist prisoner handling team has been deployed to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the crew have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we have made it clear that those responsible will be brought to justice.
The prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the director of the prison received medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In October last year, agents of the riot police were sent to the prison to deal with a serious incident in which prisoners had attacked the prison staff with billiard balls.
The hurricane threatens to strike the Phoenix metropolitan area, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding
It is unusual for a tropical cyclone to make landfall in Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa hit the southwestern desert, with the potential for flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for flash flooding in the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The expected date for the arrival of the hurricane is Tuesday, October 31.
The Phoenix Weather Service said only ten tropical cyclones had maintained their tropical storm status or depression status in a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix from 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina was approaching 65 km (40 mi) from the border of Arizona.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center forecast from 5 to 10 inch (130 to 250 mm) of heavy rainfall, with a maximum of 15 inches (38 cm) in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim.
It is likely that between 2 and 5 inches of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 inches in isolated areas, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In areas where there is no risk of flash flooding, the rains of Rosa are a blessing, as they are a relief from drought.
Although a flood is a serious matter, it is likely that some of the flooding is beneficial because of the drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported by weather.com.
First, the hurricane will strike the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a powerful hurricane with maximum winds of 136 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm is now moving into the Pacific Ocean, and is losing strength.
The system is expected to make landfall in Mexico on the evening of Monday.
There is a possibility of heavy rainfall in some areas of Mexico, which could lead to flooding.
“Se expects a torrential rainfall of between 7 and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 cm”, as reported by weather.com.
After that, Rosa will move northward to Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the border of Arizona at the first hours of Monday morning. Then, she will move southwestward through Utah to the last hour of Tuesday.
“The greatest threat to the remains of Rosa is the heavy rainfall from a tropical cyclone in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the southwestern part of the U.S. Sahara.”
It is expected that these heavy rains will cause flash floods and mudslides, and also landslides in the mountains.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects in an attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, towards 4:00 on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he is now “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon Police said.
The agents have called on anyone who may have recorded the incident to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the anger and the rage of the Democratic Party”
“Voting for the judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the tactics of the Democratic Party, which is the party of the disgraceful and dishonorable”, said Trump in a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered “the misery and anger” of the Democratic Party during the entire confirmation process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying vehemently and emotionally charged the Christine Blasey Ford allegation that he had sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.
The prosecution also submitted a statement by Ford, which was translated into Spanish.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, Americans saw the cunning, courage and bravery of Justice Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our time, a jurist with a record of unparalleled public service,” said to his supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's nomination by saying that Republicans should be ready to support him.
Five weeks to an election that is going to be important to the world.
I don't present myself, but I am here.
“So I’ve been going from place to place, trying to find the right person.
Trump claimed that Democrats are on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
The first vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court is expected to be held no later than Friday, reported a high-level Republican Party official to CNN.
About 1,000 people have died in a series of earthquakes and a tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the enormous waves that were ravaging the shores of Sulawesi, as reported by the local authorities.
Centenars of people gathered on the beach in Palu on Friday evening to celebrate a festival when waves of up to six metres high came ashore at dusk, destroying everything in their path.
The earthquake occurred after a 7.5 earthquake.
“When people were warned of a tsunami, they were still at the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB, in Indonesian), in a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it carried everything that was on land, houses, boats, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the open sea, everything that was on the open sea, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was on the
Some people climbed to the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,000 people were evacuated to 24 shelters.
The aerial photographs taken by the UNHCR showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, bridges and other buildings, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The earthquake struck the coast on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in a region with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT, for its acronym in Indonesian) released a statement that the energy released by the great earthquake of Friday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which rests on a long and narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that thousands of homes, shopping centers, and hotels had been destroyed.
According to the UN, some bodies of those killed in the collapsed buildings were found.
Nugroho said the number of deaths and damage could be higher along the 300 km coastline to the north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter.
The communications were completely paralyzed and there was no information about Donggala.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be worse.
On Saturday, the news agency received many criticisms for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the waves had already reached the coast when the warning was issued.
In a video captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the last floor of a building is heard warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, destroying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications in the area around Palu, making coordination of rescue efforts difficult.
The army started sending cargo planes with food and other essentials from Jakarta and other cities, but the people need food and other essentials.
The airport reopened only for relief operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the shelters on Sunday.
The number of deaths from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami is estimated at 800.
It is a very bad thing.
Although the World Vision staff in Donggala have arrived safely to Palu, where they are sheltered under tents in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating picture of their way to the city, said Mr. Doseba.
They said they had seen many houses destroyed.
It is a very bad thing.
Even as the groups of aid workers were putting the machinery in motion, some people were lamenting that there was not enough room for them to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, only foreign funds, supplies and personnel can be used to help with disaster relief operations if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
And yet, it is still not clear what will happen to the children.
It is still a disaster at a provincial level, said Aulia Arriani, the deputy director of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the Government declares a disaster, we can start to provide assistance, but it has not happened yet.”
After the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of those still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the devastating stories written by natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the national paragliding team of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing paraglidists for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia in September.
Other students who were trapped in the hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were students of Mr. Mandagi.
I have a lot of experience in the field of paragliding, and I carry my own emotional load.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed, he had sent desperate messages to the paragliding competitors at the festival in the beach.
However, the messages were marked with two checks instead of the usual one.
I think that it means that the messages were not delivered.
Robbers steal $26,000 from a bank in Newport
On Friday morning, a robbery occurred at a Brink ATM in Newport on the Levee, where a cashier was charging a machine, and he was reported to have taken 26,750 USD, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied a bank ATM in the centre of the amusement park and was preparing to charge it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man ran behind the cashier and stole a briefcase containing the money for the reloading fund.
According to the report, there were several witnesses who saw the suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved.
Anyone with information about the person's identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Kanye West
Kanye West will be changing his name to Ye.
Announced Saturday: “The person previously known as Kanye West”.
He has been called Ye for a long time, and he has used it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change arrives before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
Suspended Ariana Grande's performance because of 'emotional reasons'.
He also said that the word had a religious significance to him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’”, she said while speaking about the title of the album with Big Boy on radio.
I am you, we are you.
He was Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, and he is now Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
It is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, Jay-Z, has used his name in all caps or in all caps without a hyphen.
The Mexican president promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected President of Mexico, has pledged never to use the army against the civilian population, as he approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloodshed in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador pledged to never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.
On 2 October 1968, the army fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people.
President López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing them with monthly stipends.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
United States should double the funding for I. A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional of artificial intelligence.
The comments arise after the United States Government's announcements, even when, in general, the United States does not have an official I. A. policy.
China has also presented its plan last year: its goal is to be the number 1 in innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I. A. research would be a good start, given that most other countries are far behind the United States. We have our sights set on the next advance in the field of I. A.”, says Lee.
Double the funding means double the chances of the next major achievement in the United States, as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most important I. A. companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University, where he developed a computer chess system that beat the best American chess player. Later, he was executive vice president of Microsoft Research and president of the Google China subsidiary.
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) awarded recognition to the following robotics competitions, as the next step in the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be, which would allow for the next generation of visionary innovators.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to secure government grants, said Lee.
China is not China; the leaders are being taken by the corporations
In the last few years, Google, Facebook, and other technology companies have hired a number of notable graduates from universities to work for them.
The United States should also consider changing its immigration policy to encourage more immigration to the United States.
I think that doctors should be given permanent residency cards automatically,” said Dr. A.
The Chinese Council of Science and Technology for the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan was presented in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds scientists from universities and other government agencies, but the quality of academic research in China is lower than in the United States, said Lee.
In January of this year, the Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic sectors.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in AI Next.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in scientific research.
While the U.S. legislation that created the National Security AI Commission has not yet been implemented, it has led to a number of new initiatives.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change their country's name
The people of North Macedonia voted on Sunday to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”, a gesture that would resolve decades of conflict with Greece, which had blocked its EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbour North Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the European Union.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on a new name, but the opposition nationalists claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Ivanov has said he would not vote in the referendum and a campaign of boycott has cast doubt on whether the referendum will be valid.
The ballot paper asked the following question: "Do you approve of the question: 'Do you approve of the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cyprus on the establishment of a European Union Agency for Cyprus?'?"
Opponents of the name change, including the first Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a price worth paying to make Macedonia one of the countries that arise from the breakup of Yugoslavia, which is trying to gain access to bodies such as the European Union and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live with freedom in the shelter of the European Union, which means a safer life for all.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to be decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in the Parliament.
The Electoral Commission declared that, at 1:00 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary election, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
I have come to vote for my children, my place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, the first Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their ballot in the referendum on a name change in Macedonia that would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of tents planted by those who were to boycott the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads high, not by the back door.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and join the Euro-Asian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says Macedonia's membership in NATO would bring in foreign investment, which is needed to help the country's economy.
“I believe that the majority of the citizens will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens support the EU and NATO.
He said that a positive result would be a confirmation of our future.
In a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Studies, 30–43% of voters were expected to participate in the referendum, which is a lower turnout than the required turnout.
Another poll by Macedonian TV revealed that 57% of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote for the bill.
A referendum is considered successful if the turnout is at least 50% of the eligible voters.
If the plan fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
This is Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, evades the whole defence to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defence in the City's 2-0 win at the City of Manchester Stadium.
It was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The midfielder received a pass in the middle of the field.
Running through three defenders before entering the open ground.
Then he was surrounded by four green shirts.
Heavily out-jumped by a defender before he could even cross the halfway line.
He made a pass to the left, where was Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who then hit the ball with his right foot to deny the goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-footed shot that reached the right side of the net.
“Agüero has some issues with his foot”, said Pep Guardiola, City manager, to the press.
We would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That was what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal in that minute.
Sterling was the first to score, but it was the Spurs who took the lead.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball in the Brighton territory.
He made a good pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave some touches before Sterling went to the second stroke.
The striker from the Sky blues scored the goal just before the goal line.
The City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruffle the feathers of the Rockies
With the National League eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force a second opening.
Still, the always competitive Scherzer is looking forward to pitching Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Dodgers, in the West Division of the National League, can beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wild card spot after beating the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but still chase their first division title.
“Although we don’t have anything to lose, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver audience will be cheering and that the other team will probably play at the highest level they’ve played this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but it seems that they are inclined to keep Scherzer in the game.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start on Thursday, will be on the sidelines for the rest of the week.
The Washington tore through the season with a record of 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 entries.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, by speaking of the importance of the Republican Party's participation in mid-term elections.
In November, we are at the crossroads of our life.
Five weeks before the most important election of our lives are up, we are still in the dark about the outcome.
It is one of the most important. I am not present, but I am a race, so I am going from place to place fighting for great candidates.
We have a terrible radical democratic group, it is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, they see malice, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to pass over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control. And we won’t give it to them.
Democrats are committed to a mission of resistance and obstruction.
“We have seen this last four days”, said, saying that Democrats were “very angry, very bad, very false”.
Mr. Senator Feinstein was referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was heckled by the crowd.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
What's that?
No, I don't know, I hope you'll give me an answer.
The Labour Party now covers a broad spectrum of views.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When my local Momentum activists voted to censure me, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a long line of Labour MPs who are told that they are not welcome, and only because they say what they think.
Mr. Ryan, I am very concerned about the anti-Semitism that is rising in Europe.
In my view, the motion to censure me was a political attack on me.
I was opposed to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to Europe.
We want to make sure that our meetings are inclusive and productive.
I have been a member of the Labour Party for eight years, and that is exactly what they have been the Friday night meetings of the General Committee.
I regrettably, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a more kind and gentler policy is now forgotten, if it ever was.
It is clear that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged in terms of whether the leaders of the party consider it acceptable or not.
This began after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he shared a similar political vision started to expect him to change radically and to adopt positions with which he had never been in agreement, whether on national security or on the single market of the European Union.
Always when I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on the internet, demanding my removal, accusing me of the policies of the centre, and saying I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced it.
I am certainly lucky to be more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as their comments tend to be political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who are continually subjected to sexist and racist abuse, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era is the normalization of insult.
The week before, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that broad range of opinions and with each motion “of censure” or each change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
Over the last two years, I have received many counsels that I should keep my head down and not make a lot of noise.
I don't want to get involved in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party in high school, I was motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government of my school, which left my classroom in a state of utter ruin.
I have never hidden my political views, and I have never hidden my political views.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to have ignored my political views or areas in which I was not in agreement with the current leaders.
Only one thing I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday is that I don't understand these efforts to lose time and energy on my loyalty to the Leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a no-deal Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the electorate, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any opportunism will prevent me from acting as I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: A victory for the underdog
Two late goals in the last game of the match may have decided the final result, but Ayr deserved to win the game.
Now the top team is the only team undefeated in the league.
At the end, it was his defensive skill and his ability to take advantage of opportunities that gave the team a victory.
We have been tested in all the parties and we have been undefeated, so I am happy to be here.
Robyn Christie, from the Melrose, said: “The Ayr should be recognized for the opportunities it gave me.”
The 14th minute try by Grant Anderson, converted by Frazier Climo, gave the Ayr a lead; but a yellow card to Rory Hughes, a loaned Warrior for the match, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the disadvantage of the opposition and Jason Baggot scored a try that was not converted.
Clima extended the lead with a penalty. Before half time, he scored a try and converted it himself, leaving the score 17-5 at half time.
However, the second half started well for the Melrose, but the half-time score was reduced to five points.
After a long break for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, and resuming the game, Ayr led with a try by McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of having a man more than the opposition with a penalty try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a great deal of pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when Struan Hutchinson was booked for a tackle on Climo without the ball, from the sideline, MacPherson scored a try when the maul was advancing.
Climate converted, as he had been doing since the restart of the game, after Kyle Rowe received a ball from David Armstrong on a kick and sent Gregor Henry to the touchline to score the fifth try for the home side.
The protagonist of the game wants to move into the restaurant business.
Kieran Ford, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restaurant business after being appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years old is Jack Jarvis in the BBC's long-running comedy show, which he co-writes with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, the director of Adriftmorn Limited is Mr.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, but a source from the Scottish Sun reported that Kiernan was interested in the “booming” Glasgow restaurant market.

From the Titicaca to the Amazon, the bases show the motto: The sea belongs to the sea,
The recovery of the stolen goods is a duty.
In all Bolivia, a land without sea, yet they still remember vividly the lost coastline to Chile in a bloody nineteenth century dispute over the resources that took place in the nineteenth century, and the desire to return to navigating the Pacific Ocean.
The hope is that the court will reach a decision by October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and calm, and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision.”
Many Bolivians will watch the verdict of the International Court of Justice in large screens across the country, hoping that the court will rule in Bolivia’s favour and grant it the right to a sea-level outlet to the Pacific Ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is battling for re-election in the next year's elections, has much to say about the resolution of Monday.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would not change much if it did.
The United Nations Organization has no power to determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's final judgment came only six months after the end of the case's oral arguments indicates that the case was not complicated, said Chilean lawyer Paz Zárate.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years have been a time of delay.
“The problem of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration”, said Zárate.
The United States also welcomed the decision of the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution on the situation in the Western Sahara, which was adopted by consensus.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk about it, but it will be difficult to continue talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at the International Court of Justice, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered a “new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutually beneficial results.”
Morales also denied that he was using the maritime issue as a political mule.
Bolivia never will give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind us.”
North Korea says it will not disarm unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Minister of North Korea, says North Korea will never be the first to disarm if it cannot trust Washington.
President Boutros Boutros-Ghali spoke before the United Nations General Assembly.
Instó the United States to fulfil its promises made in a summit in Singapore.
His comments arrive at a time when Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State of the United States, appears to be about to restart nuclear talks with North Korea, which have been suspended for more than three months.
The UN Security Council has adopted resolutions on the Korean question, but the United States has consistently opposed them.
Washington is skeptical of North Korea's commitment to disarmament, and Pyongyang is reluctant to make any significant disarmament moves.
Kim and President Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the sincerity of Pyongyang's willingness to give up its nuclear arsenal.
Pyongyang is expected to host a summit in the coming month to prepare for the upcoming inter-Korean summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest huge hats that are about to land in a shopping mall near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or to protect yourself from the sun, you can't miss this one.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a large collection of bizarre hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, shining the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Spanish: 
The most remarkable piece of Valentino's collection was a broad-brimmed hat with feathers attached to the sides of the models' heads.
Other large accessories included a snake, a wand with jewels, and a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled the look of Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
A team of scuba gear, snorkel and diving equipment, including diving masks and diving goggles, was on display.
If you like fashion, you're in luck.
The hunters of style predict that hats of this size will be seen on the streets.
The big hats are back with a hat from “La Bomba”, with a 60 cm winged hat used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that created this huge beach bag presented yet another great creation at the runway: a beach bag as big as the model in swimsuit.
The rafia bag, decorated with feathers and with a white leather strap, was the main item in the La Riviera collection for the Paris Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2019 season.
As Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m expecting bigger beach bags and huge beach hats in the street shops next summer. 
’s design has had a big impact, and it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental for citizens of the world.
Scotland's independent schools have a long record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the exams that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes achieved in sport, the arts, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these independent schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SISC, by its acronym in English), are committed to delivering the best level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further study and to prepare them for careers in the world they will occupy.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a curriculum, the modern languages are still popular and desired in schools.
As you know, Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his own language, he will understand you.
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you can't just rely on English.
We have seen that the recent results of the examinations have been very high, and the English language is in the top three in the tables.
In total, 68% of students studying foreign languages achieved an A grade.
The data from 74 SCIS centres showed that 72% of students achieved an A in Chinese, while 72% of students studying German, 69% of students studying French and 63% of students studying Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support the teaching of languages as a fundamental skill that children and young people will need in the future.
In the past, languages were considered to be at the same level as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Skills Commission revealed that, of the reasons given by employers about the difficulties they encountered in recruiting skills, 17% were attributed to language skills.
The language skills are becoming increasingly important for the future of our children.
The increasing demand for English skills is driving the need for English language skills to be taught in schools.
Independent of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because of the language skills they have acquired through this course.
The ability to communicate with people from other countries will enable them to catch up with the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4000 adult UK residents in 2013, 75% of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation.
The importance of language teaching in today's children's education is now a well-known fact.
If they know several languages, especially those of the developing countries, children will be better equipped to find quality jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on modern languages such as English, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Any child who attends a private school will have the opportunity to choose from several languages taught by specialized teachers in this area.
Independent schools in Scotland devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
In these times, it is clear that, in a globalised world, the importance of languages is vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Languages are not just a means of communication, but also a means of learning and understanding.
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It is necessary to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The fans who have been waiting to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers are about to be disappointed.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will play in the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the exact length of the game is still to be determined.
It will be more than one and less than 48,” said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The LA Times' Mike Trudell tweeted that it was likely that James would play a few minutes.
After a weekend of training last week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason schedule.
In this stage of my career, I don’t need to play any pre-season games.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, channel de YouTube
President Trump starts campaigning in West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies planned by President Trump for the next week, including stops in Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy pending, Trump is attempting to secure support for the next mid-term election, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are deposed in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia and where can I watch it?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 pm
You can watch it live on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on the week's hearings on the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, which were marred by the allegations of sexual misconduct and have left a Senate vote on his confirmation pending for as much as a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the primary objective of these rallies is to help Republican candidates to take on the Democratic Party in the November elections.
The campaign of President Trump's next five rallies are meant to "inspire and encourage volunteers and supporters while the Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that he will travel to as many states as possible during the campaign,” said a campaign spokesman who declined to be named.
The event is scheduled to be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, West Virginia, this evening.
The second time this month, President Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, who is lagging in the polls.
“It is a good sign that Mr. Morrisey has to be pushed by the president to be in the polls”, said Simon Haeder, a political science professor at West Virginia University, to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows courage and determination to keep the hope alive for the Sunday singles matches.
After three singles matches, the foursomes on the final day of the Cup may be the cup's best.
The pendulum swinging stick is a completely invented concept, but players believe in it, more so in competitions like this.
Then, where is the drive now?
“They were six points ahead of us and now they’re four points ahead of us, so I think that’s a small push.”
Europe has a clear advantage, by a margin of four points.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have a little wind in their sails and plenty of reasons to be cheerful, among other things because of the pairing of Spieth and Thomas, who played together all day and achieved three points each.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee and preaches with the example.
The loud guttural screams of celebration rose in volume as the round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the match at 4-all.
The putt that gave them the win was received with a shout similar to that of the team that believed the Americans were out.
“What to do next is to redouble our efforts and concentrate on the party.”
That's what they did.
18 holes to leave a mark.
Only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The odd couple from Europe have four straight wins and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only pair who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That streak and the way in which his energy flows with the crowded audience shows that these are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, the two at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Simpson despatched Sergio García, the hero of the morning four-ball, to the back of the field.
A double bogey and two bogeys in the first nine holes sent the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole that they could not escape.
But Sunday there will be no help for the holes.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch because you can see the interactions between the partners, the counsel that is given and the counsel that is not given, and how a strategy can change in a matter of seconds.
Europe has played better as a team and has a great lead going into the final round, but this four-ball session also showed that the U.S. team is willing to fight, something that some Americans doubted.
Europe is leading the race to the World Cup
Europe has a good lead after the last day of the Ryder Cup, after the fourball and foursomes matches, with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two wins over Tiger Woods, who was struggling, trailing by four points.
Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a team from the United States that made many errors during the fourballs of the morning, which ended 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, but did not manage to reduce the deficit.
The American Jim Furyk needs to win eight of the 12 matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four consecutive points. And Molinari, who received the nickname of “Molliwood” after a stellar weekend, is the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, his magnificent partnership with Reed served to beat the dejected Woods and the American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a score of 5-4.
Woods, who in the two matches of the weekend had not been too impressive, had occasional bursts of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the fourballs in the morning, returned to being the Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a score 2-1.
Although the day was calm and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe was not all it seemed.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as the reference for the Americans, scoring two points each.
They achieved a stunning upset victory over Ian Poulter and Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only two teams have recovered from a four-point deficit in the singles, but Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, is the only one who can keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it is not possible to disarm unilaterally if it does not have confidence in the United States.
On Saturday, the Foreign Affairs Minister of North Korea reported to the United Nations that the continued sanctions would deepen North Korea's mistrust of the United States and that there was no prospect of North Korea relinquishing its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho made a statement before the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea had taken “important steps in good faith” in the past year, including the cessation of nuclear testing and the destruction of nuclear facilities, and pledging to uphold the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
However, there was no response from the United States.
“If we do not have faith in the United States, we cannot have faith in our own security.
Although Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea against Washington's refusal to grant a “phased” nuclear disarmament, his statement is important, as it does not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first North Korean leader meeting with an American president in June, when Kim committed to working towards the “peaceful and nuclear-free development of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said North Korea must give up its nuclear weapons.
The United States has also resisted calls for a tougher stance against North Korea.
“The United States have insisted on nuclear disarmament first and have increased pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve their objective of achieving a peaceful end to the war, even though they objected to a declaration of cessation of hostilities.
The idea that sanctions can make us kneel is a fantasy of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions is deepening our distrust.
The UN Secretary-General did not mention any second meeting between Kim Jong-un and Trump, which was announced with bombo and platerettes by the American leader at the United Nations.
Instead of that, the Foreign Minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea had been the party interested in the nuclear disarmament on the peninsula of Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the peninsula of Korea would not be in a stalemate like this.”
Even so, the tone of the speech of the year past was radically different from the speech of the previous year, when she said that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles toward American soil after the “evil” Trump, in a suicidal mission, called North Korean “rocket man”.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who the year before threatened to destroy North Korea completely, praised Kim for his courage in pushing for the North Korean nuclear disarmament, but said that much more work was still to be done and that it was necessary to continue to apply sanctions until North Korea had fully disarmed.
We have no fixed timetable.
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its recent advances.
However, as the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, reported to the Security Council on Thursday, “the imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without default until we achieve a fully verified and fully-nuclear-free nuclear-weapons-free world.”
The Security Council has imposed unanimous sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic and nuclear weapons programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang in the coming months to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times in 2019, but his latest visit was not a success.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had been progress, but hours later, North Korea denounced the demands as those of a mobster.
In a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in June, North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear weapons facility and nuclear reactor if the United States imposed sanctions.
He said that Kim had told him that the measures he sought were those that the United States had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Students from Harvard University are taking a course on how to sleep well.
Thanks to a new course taught at Harvard University, all students are now sleeping more in an attempt to fight against the growing culture of studying all night drinking coffee.
A teacher discovered that students at the number one university in the world don't know how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist in the Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
A girl came up to me and asked me why I hadn't told her about this last year.
He had never heard of the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains the basic concepts of good sleep habits and how they contribute to academic and sporting success, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the medical school's health services, said the university decided to add the course after discovering that students were rarely asleep during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive activities.
In a section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, and also of the impact of lack of sleep on sporting performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to bed.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cancer.
Then, a mascot icon encourages students to think about their daily routines.
We know that it won't change the behavior of students instantaneously.
We believe that they have the right to know, as everyone else has the right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco.
He said that the culture of “passing the night in bed” still existed and added that the modern technology and the pressure on students was increasing, which meant that the problem of sleep deprivation was growing.
Sleeping enough and a good sleep is the secret weapon of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gain weight, as sleep deprivation leads to hunger, so they want to eat everything all the time.
Raymond So, a California-born 19-year-old, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after having attended one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He was inspired by the course to open up the campus to the outside world.
The following step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program before they join the institute.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students think of putting an alarm for bed and another for awakening, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic devices and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm, so they would have difficulty falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: The goal by Gerrard knocks the men down
The Rangers suffered a second episode of depression when the Dolly Menga-led team was beaten 1-0 by Livingston.
The Ibrox boys wanted to get their first away win since February, when they beat St Johnstone 4-1, but the team of Gary Holt beat the Hearts for the second time in 18 games as his manager, leaving the Hearts top of the Premiership ladder.
The attack on Menga occurred at half time and the Rangers' poor performance was not up to the task.
Now, the Rangers drop to sixth place, the Livingston climb to third place, by goal difference.
May the Rangers may have more problems, as Calum Spence had to be helped off the field after he was hit in the head by a thrown object from the visitors' end.
Gerrard changed eight of the starting players who won the Ayr match, entering the semi-finals of the League Cup.
Holt also took 11 Livingston players who were on the bench for the last week's game against Hearts and would have been delighted by the way his organised team kept the opposition at bay all game long.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but the Livingston took better advantage of theirs.
They should have marked the two minutes mark when Menga passed to Scott Pittman who was left unmarked in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder's shot went wide.
Keaghan Jacobs threw a deep free kick for the captain Craig Halket, but Alan Lithgow could only manage to send it wide.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction on their part.
No doubt about that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request for a penalty.
The Rangers scored two goals in the first half, but former Celtic goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only required to deal with a header from Lassana Coulibaly and a dull free kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by the Livingston was a surprise, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers were unable to capitalize on a free kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher scored, keeping calm and passing the ball to Scott Robinson who scored.
During the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an immediate impact, as Kelly was brought down by him.
Yet, even though the Livingston continued to play the type of game that they enjoyed, Lithgow and Halkett cleared a pass after another.
The Holts could have made more profit in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to deny Jacobs a goal before Lithgow headed in the corner.
The Rangers' substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson did nothing.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: 30 September 1882, today 136 years, and counting...
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which since then has become a symbol of science, also became a symbol of pop culture, as in the movie “The Bells of Coronado”, from 1950, with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the dual roles of vaqueros scientists:
What is this?
Rogers: "A Geiger counter is used to detect radioactive material.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: “It’s like a radio!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them.
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
The protein is injected into the bloodstream and is then transported to the tumor cells.
A study of a vaccine for breast cancer is generating promising results in patients with breast cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory to make them “see” a common protein found in many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
The professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promote the growth of different types of cancer”, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West was seen wearing a MAGA hat on SNL after he appeared on the show.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was booed by the studio audience after a rambling performance in which he praised President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he began to despise Democrats and endorsed Trump.
I often talk to a white person and ask him why he likes Trump.
I don’t care about racism. I’ve been here for a long time.
SNL started the program with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the star of Hollywood mocks the declaration of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee in relation to the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock's tirade against the host of "The Daily Show" was posted to YouTube.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West.
I also said to the audience that I had been very uncomfortable wearing that hat.
They were after me.
They told me to keep my hat on.
I was wrong.
And then they say I'm sleeping.
West continued: “Do you want to see me asleep?” and said that he was going to put on his superman's coat, which meant that no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.
His comments received booing from, at least, two audiences and SNL members seemed to be embarrassed, as reported by Variety. One person said: “The studio was silent”.
West had been invited to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was surprised when he appeared on stage in a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of conservative leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “One of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU for your resistance against the mob”.
Karen Hunter, a host on a TV show, tweeted that West was “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful”.
But I decide not to award someone (buying his music or his clothes, or supporting his art) who I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology.
He is free.
We also have a plan to have a new building built.
Before the show, rapper Kanye West announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to “the person previously known as Kanye West”.
It is not the first artist to change his name, following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the legendary musician, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Trial of a murder charge for attempted murder
A man of 45 years has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, as reported by the police.
The accused is expected to appear in court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Hugh Jackman, the star of "Game of Thrones", attacks the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the fantasy drama series of the HBO, Game of Thrones.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the hero male, saying that those screen roles often transmitted to young men that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes something went wrong and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he finds it “very important” to address the issue.
“I think it is important that we look at the masculinity issue.
What have we been teaching men while they were growing up, thinking of the problems they are now facing?
Kit believes that television can have a part of the responsibility for the rising male toxic masculinity due to the characters in the show.
What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think it is one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something is wrong with the education of young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones when the series concludes in summer, saying he was “tired of battlefields and horses”.
In November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's True West, a play about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
I think it's great to know my wife.
I met my wife on the show, so I know my future family and my life is going to change from now on.
Rose was the love interest of Jon Snow, the main character in the fantasy drama series "Game of Thrones".
The couple married in June 2018 in the family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new HIV infections
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of HIV-positive persons.
There are more than 820,000 people affected by the disease, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, there were 40,000 new cases of HIV infection.
Most of these were contracted through sexual transmission, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread quickly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV from this practice has been reduced to a large extent, the authorities said in a conference in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the gay community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community still faces discrimination.
A cause of the conservative values of the country, studies have calculated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with men will marry women.
Many of the diseases are spread through unprotected sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked any information on Republican Senators and asserts that it is “dangerous and conspiracy theories”
Representative Maxine Waters criticized Saturday the accusation that a member of her staff had published personal information of three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about legislators.
The Democratic Party of California's candidate for California's 5th congressional district, Democrat Linda Sánchez, said that the allegations were "stirred up by the right-wing media and the Republican Party" (en español: "Las acusaciones contra el candidato demócrata del 5.° distrito de California, Linda Sánchez, fueron impulsadas por los comentaristas de extrema derecha y los sitios web de extrema derecha").
“Lies, lies and more lies”, commented Waters on Twitter.
According to the allegations, the information published included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee, from Utah,
On Thursday, an unknown person in the Capitol published information on the Internet during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
The conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was associated with Waters &apos; office, and made public the personal information of a Waters &apos; employee.
This accusation is completely false and a complete lie.
“The member of my personal whose personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not the source of the leak.
This allegation is completely false and a complete lie.
The statement by Waters sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Disavows this information”, wrote Fleischer.
It suggests that temperance is necessary to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
Do not rebel against God.
The accuser should not question the motives of the accused.
You should be calm and calm.
It seems that Fleischer was trying to compare the reaction to Kavanaugh's appearance with the Democratic Party's criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during his testimony.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
It is very serious, is very serious.
In his statement, Mr. Waters said his office had warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about the fraudulent activities.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice and that they are held accountable.

Ahora se ha convertido en una tradición buscar guiños al Brexit en cualquier película nueva con un enfoque británico. Parece que esto es lo que corresponde hacer con esta nueva entrega de la franquicia paródica de acción y comedia Johnny English, que empezó en 2003 con Johnny English y volvió a la vida en 2011 con Johnny English Returns.
Is this a joke?
En cualquier caso, el incompetente Johnny English, con sus ojos saltones y su rostro inexpresivo, ha renovado su licencia para meter la pata por segunda vez. Solo su nombre ya da pistas de que, más que nada, se trata de una creación cómica pensada para territorios cinematográficos de habla no inglesa.
Yes, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions of glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a splash of that guy who played a single note in the theme of Carros de fuego at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games.
The film also features a mysterious international man who was played by Atkinson in the long-running Barclaycard TV commercials.
There are two good moments in the film.
I loved watching Johnny English get in a medieval helicopter and crash into the ship's hull.
The Atkinson gift for comedy is clearly visible, but the humour is short and rather silly, especially as the genre of serious films like 007 and Mission: Impossible adds humour without problems.
The humour seems more directed at children than at adults, and I find the absurd adventures of Johnny English to be more funny than funny.
Now, the repeated argument that Britain is in trouble is a commonplace.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network of Britain, revealing the identities of all its active agents in service to the sadly small role of a minor player.
It is the last straw for the first minister, a pompous and over-the-top character who is now seeing how her popularity is sinking: Emma Thompson delivers her best performance as the character, but the script does not allow much room for her to work.
His intelligence advisers informed him that, as all active spies are in danger, he must call on a retired spy.
That's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong one, he's the wrong
Spanish: 
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain's job, a role that is not fully appreciated.
So, the bad guys who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of His Majesty's Government return to action, with the beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the first minister is falling into the dangerous arms of a charming multimillionaire from the world of technology, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their absurd adventures: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a French elegant restaurant, hide in the luxurious andate of Volta; English also becomes a total anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Definitively, they went all out in the last scene, but, no matter how loud and loudly they played the part, the whole thing still sounds a bit like a child's play.
A fairly regular product.
Al igual que con las otras películas de Johnny English, no pude evitar preguntarme si la industria cinematográfica británica no podría darle a Rowan Atkinson un papel que haga auténtica justicia a su talento.
The Labour Party denies that it is planning to introduce a weekly working week of four days.
The Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan that would see workers work four days a week, but would pay them five.
According to the party, the owners of the companies should allocate the savings obtained from AI technology to workers, giving them a day off.
The employees would have three days' holiday.
According to sources, the idea would fit into the economic and political plans and agenda of the party's economic and political agenda.
This change to a week of four days has received the support of the labor unions, as it is a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told me: We expect a review of the directive by the end of the year.
"It is not possible to achieve a day-to-day work week of four days in one go, but the week of four working days is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate in favour of the worker, as well as in the industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this type of idea, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day week in its election campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party supports the decision.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The weekend work week is not part of the party's policy and it is not being discussed at this time".
The Shadow Treasury Minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to present his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from anonymous directors and "squeezed" directors who were "taking advantage" of their positions.
The shadow minister also included in his plans the idea that current shareholders of water companies would not be repaid for their shares, as a government of the Labour Party would apply deductions for irregularities perceived.
He also confirmed his intention to include employees on the board of directors of private companies and create inclusive employee ownership funds in which 10% of shares in private companies should be held by employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to £500 per person.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak on FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh
The investigation by the FBI into the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week the final vote on his confirmation as a justice of the Supreme Court and, in addition, raises the question of whether the results that are concluded might influence a Republican senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asks two Republican senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could be used to change their minds.
President Kennedy was more open than his South Carolinian counterpart.
It's clear, of course.
I supported the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the whole thing had happened, when I heard the allegation and asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, and uncompromising.
The vote of Graham, however, seems to be unchangeable.
I have already made a decision on the matter of Brett Kavanaugh and would not hesitate to overturn the allegations.
"Mrs. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it tautly", Graham said.
No one has confirmed that the person named by the witnesses has been present.
36 years ago.
It is always the same, no new thing here.
What is the Global Citizen Festival? What is the Global Citizen Festival?
Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together a stellar lineup of artists in support of a major global cause: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will move to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival began in 2012, and is a continuation of the Poverty Project, an international campaign that aims to end poverty by raising awareness of the issue and encouraging action.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the concert (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), the concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other thing that serves to raise awareness of your goal to end poverty.
The Global Citizen has achieved a lot in the past 12 years.
Do we have to give a free concert to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of the 'clicker' attitude, which is the belief that we are making a real difference by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million supporters' actions in support of more than 19 million objectives.
The campaign has also led to the adoption of a number of new targets and targets for action plans, including a pledge to reduce the number of deaths from maternal, newborn and child mortality rates by half by 2030.
In the first half of 2018, the group has committed 390 commitments and announced or announced a number of other actions, including at least 10 billion USD, and has already raised more than $10 billion.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on 649 million people in the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and implementers with its headquarters in the UK, united with the common commitment of "helping children grow and develop with all their potential". With this end in mind, they have proposed to provide Rwanda with 35 million $ to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thank you for your support, the UK government, donors, national and international partners like you, we can mark a small historic milestone in the history of social injustice in malnutrition.
The group also claimed to have carried out more than 5000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and the government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
We have a question about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food supply.
A partner of Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult road and, at times, we will fall and we will get up again.
But they have already achieved this before, and they will achieve it again.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will be hosting in New York this year, which will be presented by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to block exports of Russian energy to Cuba - Department of the Interior
"In the event of necessary action, Washington could call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking the markets, including the Middle East, revealed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that the alliance with Russia, in particular where it operates on the basis of the legitimate government, is merely a pretext for the expansion of its markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southern supplier to Europe."
The Government of the Republic of Korea has also indicated that it would like to see the United Nations Security Council adopt a resolution on the issue.
"The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to guarantee that the seaways remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that energy does not end up in the market.
Zinke spoke to people who attended a workshop organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that is described as the "voice of the consumer energy" in the United States.
He also said that the United States and Russia were still negotiating over the issue of Iran's nuclear programme.
"The alternative economic in Iran and Russia consists, basically, in using and replacing fossil fuels", he said, adding that Russia only knows how to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These assertions are made when the Trump administration has been trying to export natural gas liquified to Europe and to relieve Russia from its role as the cheapest source of gas for European consumers.
To that end, the administration Trump, including the president himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to abandon the unprofitable Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has consistently insisted on the project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is valued at 11 billion $ and is intended to double the capacity of the current gas pipeline to 110 billion m3.
The Kremlin denies that the United States is trying to block the bill because it is aimed at the Russian economy.
"I believe that all of us share the idea that energy cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said the Energy Minister of Russia, Aleksandr Novak, after meeting with Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow last September.
The American position has been met with opposition from Germany, who has expressed its dissatisfaction with the project.
The German industry leader, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has asked the U.S. to not intervene in European energy policy or in bilateral energy agreements with Moscow.
"It is a major problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Vladimir Putin.
Senator Warren will analyze carefully the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Senator Warren
Senator Warren said she would consider running for president after the midterm election.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of a referendum on the issue.
It is time for women to get to Washington to mend the broken government and to have women sit on the top of the political table.
"After the 6 November, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a public meeting and stated that he was taking the country "wrong"
I am concerned about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren spoke without hesitation about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from Friday last week, Warren said: "It is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote.
On Thursday, a poll was published in which a majority of Warren's own voters did not believe he should run for president in 2020.
A 58% of Massachusetts voters said they should not have Senator Kerry run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
About 32% of respondents supported her candidacy.
In the survey, the support for former governor Deval Patrick was 38% and the opposition was 48%.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would announce his decision on January 1, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin
Spanish: 
The man was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"My son's situation is well known to the other families who have suffered the effects of PTSD and other injuries sustained by our soldiers.
Palin spoke of this as the great taboo of which no one wants to talk about, and commented on her son and other veterans of war who seemed to be "returning with a different attitude, hardened, asking if there really is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all other members of the army, have given to their country".
On Monday, a man was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, charged with a domestic violence incident and possession of drugs or alcohol while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the effort to revise the immigration policy
18 States and the District of Columbia support a court challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia met in Washington on Friday to show their support for a refugee applicant who is facing the current immigration policy, reported NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" that was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) against the federal policy.
He said that his partner and his children, who are members of a violent street gang, abused her, but the US immigration officials denied his request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers who represent these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations that face generalized problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA, by its English name) that had granted asylum to domestic violence victims.
The United States District Court Judge, Karl Racine, made a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of international law, federal and state law."
"According to federal law, all asylum applications must be decided on the merits of the particular facts and circumstances of the case, and this exception violates that principle", is included in the amicus curiae brief.
The attorneys also pointed out that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the economy of the United States by saying that immigrants often become entrepreneurs and become a necessity for the economy.
The United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to deny asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Persons seeking asylum can apply if they have left their home countries because of persecution or threats to their life, religion, nationality or political opinion," Sessions said when announcing the directive on June 11, 2017.
Asylum never was created as a means to address all the problems, nor even all the problems, that people face daily.
Desperate efforts to rescue survivors from Palu while the number of dead rises to more than 1,000
For survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"The situation is very tense", Mrs. Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, was trying to comfort her baby with fever in a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
Each minute ambulances bring in more bodies.
The water supply is scarce.
Some residents have returned to their homes to rebuild their belongings amongst the few that are still standing.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals are also damaged as a result of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and a shoulder, lay outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where they were treated outside the building because of the continuous earthquakes, also very strong.
I couldn't stop crying when I was describing the violent earthquake that I was living in with my wife and daughter.
We had no time to get away.
I was trapped in the rubble of the wall that collapsed, I believe.
I heard my wife call for help and then a silence.
What has happened to her and my daughter?
I hope you're well.
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "propaganda"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement promoting the benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, referred to the China Daily's payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, the largest-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the upcoming election to the United States Congress.
The accusation that President Trump made against China for interfering in the U.S. elections marked a new phase in a campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
Governments of foreign countries frequently publish trade promotion announcements, but the current trade war between China and the United States has led to a significant increase in tariffs on imports from both sides.
The tariffs that China imposed on exports to the United States that were in place at the beginning of the trade war were intended to fall on the shoulders of the exporters of the Republican Party, who supported Trump, according to experts in both China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa Governor, said that Beijing had harmed American farmers, farmers and businesses.
According to Branstad in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register Sunday, China is intensifying its pressure on the press by publishing ads in our free press.
"To spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and press freedom.
"But in the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few dissenting voices and no reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people have on the troubling trajectory of the country's economy, as the media are firmly under the pressure of the Communist Party of China.
One of the most prominent newspapers in China, however, refused to publish the article.
Republicans are split on whether to support impeachment of Trump
As many Republicans of renown are closing ranks behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of allegations of sexual assault, and experts warn that such a backlash could occur if women voted in the midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed their desire to continue the vote.
"In this type of cases, it is impossible to go back", said Professor Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, in an article that was published on Saturday.
Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) doubted that the last attempt by Senator Flake to position himself in favor of the FBI's investigation would calm voters' anger.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they won't forget it in November or in November and in November", said Senator Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, in an interview with the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, protesters who gathered outside the Senate chanted "November is coming!" (¡noviembre llegará pronto!) as the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"Democrats are exhilarated by the enthusiasm and motivation of the Republicans", said political analyst Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan analyst.
The impact of the decision is already being felt.
But it could be even greater, especially among women in the suburbs and young women, who tend to be more apathetic about politics than their male counterparts.
Even before the public testimony of Ford, which detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court justice, analysts said a backlash could occur if the Republicans went ahead with confirmation.
"This is a big mess for the Republican Party", said former GOP chairman Michael Steele, according to NBC News.
"It's not just a vote on the committee or the final vote, it's also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they've treated her.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, but they are a few more on the side of Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll finds that 41% of respondents believe the statement by Ford is definitive or probable, while 35% believe it is definitive or probable.
About half of respondents (45%) said they believed Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30% said he had lied.
The FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford, and, at least, those of another victim, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee last week and said that Kavanaugh raped her when she was 17 years old.
Ramírez said that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her genitals at a party when she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the legendary technology legend, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to that data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Sir Tim Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to "dominate the world".
It's got to be now.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid's technology to enable users to create their own personal data warehouse online or a POD.
It can contain tasks, task lists, task schedules, task library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a browser and at the same time.
There is something that is unique about online storage of personal data.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's chief executive officer, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills necessary to make Solid reach everyone.
As of now, the company is formed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM purchased, some of the developers who were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers of technology devices around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change in their business models at once.
We won't ask permission.
In a blog post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to "provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the World Wide Web when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate over net neutrality.
Even though he is no longer the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am extremely optimistic about the next web era.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
Only one Anglican clergyman who won the Victoria Cross during the First World War was honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Captain Bernard Vann received the Croix de Guerre on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper shot him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "a special symbolic significance" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the intense fire of artillery and guns".
After running to the firing line, with the greatest courage, he advanced the line before reaching a single cannon with one hand and shot down three of the detachment.
Colonel Vann was killed by a sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I can never reach his height, but they were very alerting.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposed a floral wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a great honour for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is shown when he is given a large number of supporters".
The MMA fans were awake all night long to watch Bellator 206, but only watched Peppa Pig
Imagine that you're all night awake to see Bellator 206 to let you see the main event.
The San Jose Cartel had 13 fights, six of which were included in the main card, and in the United Kingdom it was going to be broadcast live on Channel 5.
At 6:00am, just as Rory and Gegard were getting ready to fight, the viewers in the UK were stunned when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some did not surprise themselves after having to stay up all night to watch the fight.
A fan of the show said the change was a joke.
"There is a government regulation that governs the content that is broadcast from 6 am and this wasn't appropriate, so they had to change to a programming for children's schedule", said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when we asked him about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the pig", "Peppa the
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said the company would be changing its program to include British viewers in the next edition.
I think it would be a good idea to broadcast the proceedings.
But it is 6 o'clock on Sunday morning, so we wouldn't be able to do it until Monday morning, which would be Monday for them.
We are looking at how to do it.
I believe that when the schedule was changed, there were a lot of negative messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not a government problem, it was a family problem.
I promise you that next time it won't happen again.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is the usual number we have offered. We tried to offer more than usual to the fans and we were happy with it.
It is a very unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was afraid to be gay
Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to the rest of the world because of his homosexuality, but this was what motivated him to become a champion.
At the age of 24, he realized that not all kids were like him.
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention was to transmit hope to others.
He also said he had become more appreciative of the importance of winning in the Olympics.
The host of the popular children's show, Kirsty Young, is absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne, Daley, who was shown to be a marginalised child, commented that he felt "inferior" because "he was not accepted socially to like children and girls".
He said: "I have always been aware of my inferiority and being different. He said: "I have always been aware of my inferiority and being different.
I wanted to show that he was something, he said, so he didn't disappoint me when he finally came out.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games of this year in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he told it because he was happy to be free, without threats, and he wanted to pass it on to others.
The three-time world champion also said he was surprised to fall in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married a man 20 years her senior, but she said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you live so much so young and your father dies of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you have.
The couple had a son in June who they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their perspective had changed.
"If I had been asked the year ago, all the answers would have been 'I have to win a gold medal'."
But there are things more important than the Olympic medals.
My gold medal is, without a doubt, a great achievement.
His son is called Robert, and he was born in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I was unable to tell him I would not be able to be in the front row.
"I had his hand between mine and mine when he died and I wasn't sure until that moment when he died that he wasn't invincible.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"In that moment I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: to compete in the pool in front of my family and friends, it was the best thing I had ever dreamed of.
This was also the inspiration for his first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which he sang during the preparation phase for the Olympic Games.

Mickelson, in shape, was out of the tournament on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson will establish a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad tale.
Mickelson, who was playing in the tournament for the 12th time, was beaten by Furyk in the fourballs and foursomes on the final day.
Instead of being in the centre of the action, as many times he has been for the United States, the five times champion of major tournaments has had to conform himself with watching and, in some cases, trying to improve his game on the course and then, in other cases, trying to correct the affliction.
Never the most direct of drivers, even in the height of his career, the player is not in his best shape for the course at Le Golf National, where the rough is constantly punishing with errant shots.
Y, if the field is not already too difficult, Mickelson, in the ninth round of Sunday's Open, will face the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12th hole, started the round with a stunning comeback, the Mickelson shot could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, but could say little more.
"He understood perfectly what he was doing today, he gave me a palm on the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has made a lot of contributions to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't expect to play two matches.
I thought we would be more, but that's how it was and that's how it is.
He wants to be here, like the rest of us.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of most Ryder Cup matches played.
It could be the last of a long line of Ryder Cups that had never matched his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, although Furyk said that his presence brought many more intangibles to the team.
He is funny, sarcastic, and funny.
I think the kids love him. He's a great coach.
It is a great deal more than just a game.
The captain is aware that the leadership is about to disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you have a substantial lead in the last days of the Ryder Cup, you can easily become a challenge.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a Seve Ballesteros-led American team held a five-point lead over the Spaniards, but the Americans were eventually overtaken by the Spaniards by a margin of only 14½-13½.
"You keep reminding me that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we did it in Brookline and we won, but we lost by a little bit.
The history will teach us all that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Go out and do it.
It doesn't end until the scores are in.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win the trophy, and that is our only goal.
I say it all the time, I'm always talking about the 12 players on our team, but I'm very aware of what's going on on the other side where the best players in the world are.
I'm proud of what they've done on the golf course.
Today is a new day.
What is to come is a time of individual efforts and achievements.
It's great to share things with a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone you put a lot of pressure on yourself.
That is the message to send to players, to extract the best from themselves.
Now it is time to leave the company of your partner and to go on with your own.
Bjorn, his Jim Furyk counterpart will try to have his players do better individually than they did as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who each added three points of four.
The same Furyk has been in both extremes in the last two of those great tournaments and has been part of the team that won in Brookline and then lost when Europe took place the "Miracle of Medinah".
I remember every word he said to us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, was able to motivate his players on the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we have to start as strong as we did in Brookline, as you saw in the last game.
When we all move in the same direction, the pressure is on the intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and we made them feel that we were going to do something magical tomorrow.
We gave Thomas the task of leading the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European golfers in the second half of the list.
I went with this group of boys because I think they cover the whole course.
The new German warship, delayed again
The new German frigate was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but construction has been delayed due to problems with the systems and the increasing cost of the project, reported local media.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigates class, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The ship should have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but problems arose after the ship was handed over.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful gun, an anti-aircraft missile system, and some stealth technology, like radar, infrared, and acoustic signals that are very low.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, the continuing delays have caused the navy to become outdated when they are finally commissioned, the paper said.
The unfortunate F125 frigate occupied headlines last year when the German Navy refused to put the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that a ship has been returned to a shipyard after being delivered.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors: half the number of sailors in the former Bremen class frigates.
The ship also has an excessive displacement, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The hardware was defective, and the training of the crew was also a problem.
It is believed that the total value of the project is €2.2 billion ($2.7 billion), not €1.2 billion ($1.7 billion).
The problems that are attributed to the new frigates are of special relevance in light of recent warnings about the reduction of naval power in Germany.
In the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Bundestag's defence committee, recognized that the navy was "struggling to deploy ships".
The official said that the problem has been worsening over time, because old ships have been scrapped, but no new ships have been built.
The German ships were not able to join the Navy.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTH) sponsored a survey of the state of the art in the United States.
This new study, which has been carried out in a Scottish Highland state, seeks to discover how bat species use the landscape in their search for food.
The data collected will help to clarify the behavior of only flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bat and Daubenton’s brown long-eared bat, as well as the brown long-eared marsh bat and brown long-eared brown bat in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special microphones will be placed in strategic locations in the property to track bat activity during the breeding season.
The NHS will also deploy mobile detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds recorded to discover the frequency of calls from bats and what species make them.
A report and map of the habitat will be produced, and a detailed image of the environment and its behaviour will be created.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, expects the results to reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they use them.
The information collected will be used to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of shrubland and how to maintain the forests for bat species and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affects their nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and electrical cables can also be a threat to them, as is the use of insecticide and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
The blind cave rats are not blind
but they are not as good as their eyes, which are better suited to daylight.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to locate obstacles and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in all of England, takes the bat-related topic very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys, inspections of nests and, on occasion, rescue operations.
The organization has also opened the first and only reserve dedicated to the Scottish bat in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bat.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says the area is the ideal place for them.
Here, in Threave, we have a fantastic bat cave.
We have old buildings, many mature trees and suitable habitat.
However, there are still many things that are unknown about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to develop.
It emphasizes the importance of verifying whether there are bats before undertaking maintenance work in properties, as it could be unintentionally destroying a breeding colony and killing 400 females and young, which would result in the destruction of a whole local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and other species about which we have not yet learnt much.
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape, while his lawyers are pursuing charges against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has cataloged the allegations of rape as "fake news", and says he wants to be known by his real name.
The lawyers have been instructed to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the interview.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping a woman called Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of having paid 375,000 $ to hide the incident, as reported by Spiegel on Friday.
With a live Instagram video that has already amassed 142 million followers after being published a few hours after the news, Ronaldo, 33, has called the report "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false.
They want to use my name for their own gain.
It's the same old story.
They want to be famous by mentioning me, but I can't help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine.
La firma de abogados de Ronaldo está preparando una demanda contra Spiegel por las acusaciones que aparecen en un reportaje que consideran inadmisible en el ámbito de la privacidad, según informa Reuters.
Christian Schertz said that the player will seek damages for moral damage, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in the last few years.
According to reports, the incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub, it was alleged that Ronaldo and Mayorga went to Ronaldo's room and there he raped him anally, according to the records in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo was kneeling after the alleged incident and told him that he was 99 percent a good guy and that the one percent he wasn't was a "one percent" he hadn't been good enough.
The couple confirmed that the sex was consensual, but that it was not forced.
Mayorga also says he went to the police and took photos of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside of court because he feared reprisals and was concerned about being "humiliated in public".
The woman, 34, says she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When Ronaldo was allegedly attacked, he was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has changed to Juventus, a big Italian club for a contract of 100 million €.
Brexit: the UK would regret losing car makers
The UK would regret it for life if it lost its position as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, said Secretary of Industry Greg Clark.
It was "very concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston factory would be temporarily suspended.
We need a deal.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of customs delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit would result in the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced 150 000 cars in 2010, of which 90% were exported to the European Union.
"I think if Britain breaks away from the EU in March, there will be production hiccups at our plant", said Marvin Cooke, director general of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears about the UK leaving the EU without a deal, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, is planning to close its Oxford plant one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the automotive industry are the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
The production line of Toyota is based on the just in time production method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the 29th of March the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal, there could be a border blockade that could lead to shortages and supply problems.
To Toyota it would be impossible to accommodate the equivalent of more than one day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in such a case, production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan, which sets out the future relations with the EU, is "calibrated precisely to avoid those controls at border crossings.
We need a deal. We want the best deal we can to get out of this one, and we have to take full advantage of the opportunity.
"Toyota, among other things, has to be able to continue with the success of its supply chain".
Toyota has not been able to say for how long it would stop production, but warned that the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately reduce its profitability.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite shop steward at the plant, said his members were becoming increasingly concerned: "As jobs are lost, they never recover".
We have put in place a clear and precise plan to address the future relations with the EU.
The Trump-Putin meeting could be delayed, according to the White House
The meeting of high risk with U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed another week, as the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump's ties to Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The excitement over whether or not Attorney General Sessions would be fired and, in that case, whether or not the Mueller investigation would be compromised has been fueling the gossip in Washington for months.
In the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with President Trump with a microphone he had brought with him to discuss the 25th amendment.
The United States has not been able to prove that the allegations are true.
However, on Monday, the president went to the White House, where he was greeted by President Bush.
In his place, a meeting with President Trump was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to dismiss Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the audience of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, President Trump requested the FBI investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh, which would delay the vote on his nomination.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared on Fox News Sunday Morning.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "We have not yet decided on a date, but it could be this week or it could be delayed, depending on what is going on with the Supreme Court.
We will be deciding on it on the spot and I will be keeping you informed as I do with the press.
Some journalists would refute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
What was the reason for the decision to send you to the hospital?
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to a dislike of television journalists who act with grandiloquence, but said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they fanfarron".
She said that direct contact between Mr. Trump and the press would increase.
"The president conducts more question and answer sessions than any other president before him", said, and cited no evidence to support it.
Press conferences will continue, said Sanders, but if the press has the option to ask directly to the president of the United States, I think it is much better than to have me ask them.
We've tried it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so we're trying to do it again.
Trump is known to respond to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public or press conferences with dignitaries.
The press conferences with him are rare.
This week, in New York, the president demonstrated why he was so, where he appeared in a silly and, at times, bizarre way before the journalists gathered there.
The Secretary of State for Health Scotland wrote to staff at the NHS Scotland about their fears of the consequences of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the staff at the HHS Scotland to express her gratitude for their work and wishes them to continue with them after Brexit.
Jane Freeman MP sent a letter six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of EU citizenship applications for members of the public working in the public sector that are not under the control of the central government.
Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the withdrawal process have continued, and the expected decisions were taken this autumn.
However, the UK government has also intensified preparations for a possible outcome in which there would be no agreement.
I know that it must be very confusing for you.
I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each of you, regardless of your nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries contribute valuable expertise and skills that enhance the work of health services, which benefits patients and communities to which we serve.
Scotland is your home and we are delighted to have you back.
Christopher Abercrombie is being operated on after suffering a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee State Tigers football player was operated on after suffering a head injury in a game against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ.
The Tennessee State head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred before halftime.
He came to the band and fell there.
The trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him in a stretcher and examined him in depth.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there were no details on the type of injury or the amount of damage caused.
Sophomore guard Abercrombie, who is playing his first season with Tennessee State, is a redshirt sophomore.
He made five tackles on Saturday before the game, which is a total of 18 in the whole season.
To foreigners, a capital gains tax rate of 20% is levied on the sale of real property in the UK.
To foreigners, a higher transmission tax will be levied when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to provide shelter for the homeless
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters
The increase in the land tax on land transactions will be imposed on those who do not pay income tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120m a year to support homeless people
The additional money raised by the increase in the land transmission tax in the UK will be used to fund social housing for homeless people, announced today by Theresa May.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralise the success that is enjoying Jeremy Corbyn with his promises to provide affordable housing for young voters and to target the highest-earning earners.
The transmission tax on land will be raised to encourage the government to combat the problem of homelessness on the streets.
The recargo, which is included in the current transmission tax, was also introduced in two years on second-hand houses and the "buy-to-let" system, and could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120m a year from the new tax.
13% of new build properties in London are bought by people who are not resident in the UK, which increases the price of new homes and makes it difficult for first time home buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the more affluent areas of the country (especially in the capital) have become ghost cities as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in the estate tax to help young people buy their first home.
Accused the big builders of maintaining very high prices for land without intending to give it any use and called on the Honourable Mrs. May to eliminate the housing quota for affordable housing to solve the "vergonzoso problema de la vivienda" in Britain.
The Leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has announced a series of attractive reforms for housing, including controls on renting and evictions and the end of evictions without a cause.
It also proposes to grant local authorities more power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said last year I said I would devote my first year as PM to restoring the British dream of improving the life of every new generation.
That is why we are working to address the housing crisis.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not possible that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes at a lower price than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult to achieve for many people and the humiliation of sleeping on the street is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The manager of Sunderland says his "primary objective" is to become a manager of Scotland.
The Scottish, 42, is delighted by the prospect of revitalising the club he helped to found, which is now in third place in the third tier of English football, three points behind the top club.
Having been relegated from the Premier League last season, St Mirren returned to the Premiership this summer after a season away.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a T-shirt.
But I grew up watching Scotland play Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and that's something I still want to go back to.
This opportunity only becomes reality if I can lead a successful club.
Among the predecessors of Ross as leader of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he did not feel any fear when he passed to such established names in a bigger club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"In this moment, my success is measured by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Because the structure and facilities of this club correspond to those of the Premier League, it is not surprising that the club has been given the nickname "The Premier League of the North".
It is not easy to achieve, but I would like to be able to say that I have achieved my goal when I can return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has been with the club for three years as a coach, having previously been an assistant at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months as a coach at the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to recover from relegation to the third division and helped St. Mirren to win the league championship in the following season.
Ross has been more comfortable than ever before during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real juncture.
I always believed that the direction was the best thing for me, much more than playing.
It was a good job, and I could make a lot of money with it, and I had some fun doing it.
But playing can be very tough.
You have to face many things each week.
I still feel stress and pressure from my job; however, I am feeling better.
I always wanted to train and now I have achieved it, it is the time of my life, I feel like I am in my life, I have been feeling better than ever.

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The heat wave has pushed up food prices in Britain's pubs, but the pressure is now on the fast food chains.
The pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while the restaurants’ profits dropped by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup still kept the pattern of the month of June, in which pubs increased by 2.8% their profits, but restaurants have fallen even more.
The retail sales of new cars fell by 1.8% in June, compared to a 0.3% drop in June.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly alcoholic beverages had their best month, with most restaurants experiencing a decline in profits.
The pubs that primarily serve food also suffered from the heat, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems people only want to drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of alcoholic beverages increased by 6.6% in the month, while food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, the analysts of hospitality and leisure at RSM said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since April.
The time and the impact of social and sporting events are still the most important factors in the market for out-of-home activities.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are struggling, although the 4.8 % decline in sales from the previous year will be particularly painful in view of the continuing pressure on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food service operators and the weather is telling us that the mild temperatures we have had in August will provide relief.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7% in July, reflecting the slower decline in new brand launches.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees the sales in the UK's restaurant, bar and pub sector, data is collected and analysed from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion and is the market reference value.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media
One in five children (some even 11-year-olds) have secret accounts on social media and teachers and parents are unaware of it
The survey, conducted by the World Bank, revealed a growth in the number of fake accounts on Instagram
The news media have made the news.
About 20% of students said they had a "main account"
One in five children (some even 11-year-olds) create a Facebook account to hide from parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth in the number of fake accounts on Instagram, a popular social media platform.
The news media have aggravated the sexual harassment allegations.
About 20% of the students said they had a "main account" and 20% had other private accounts.

The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mr. Mike Buchanan, Director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel that they can create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be a member of the board of the Scottish Athletics federation as a non-executive director.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from her international experience in the past decade.
"She is recognised and respected in the whole community of athletics in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that the athletics in Scotland will benefit from having her on its board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I like to be the spokesperson for athletes and hope to be able to help develop sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, has been a regular on the BBC, and is now a familiar face on the BBC.
I suffered a stroke last month.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was a tough job, but I managed to overcome it, and I am now back to full health.
Thank you for the messages and words of support!
The advertisement for the breastfeeding cow was met with criticism.
A breastfeeding company has divided opinion in the public sphere with a TV commercial where they compare breastfeeding mothers to cows.
To mark the launch of what is claimed to be the first silent breast pump in the world, the consumer technology company Elvie published an advertisement inspired by a video with a somewhat ironic tune.
Four real women dance in a hay barn full of hay, with the following lyrics: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "I'm not a cow, but I have my breasts".
The choir is saying: "Ordénalas, ordénalas, estoy ordeñándolas, estoy ordeñando a mis vacas".
However, the post was removed from Facebook after a few hours.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from people who say it has brought to light the horrors of the dairy industry.
A very unfortunate decision to announce cows to market.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them after they give birth.
The breast pump Elvie is discreetly worn in a nursing suit (Elvie/Mother).
Another mother said: "It was traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, why not use them to announce a breast milk extractor for mothers who do stay at home?
Another comment was: “How absurd.”
However, other people defended the announcement, such as a woman who said it was “hilarious”.
I think it is a great idea.
If I were a breastfeeding mother, I would certainly have one.
I used the bomb, I felt like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I don't give it more thought.
It is a genius product, I like it.
Another person was commenting: “It was a funny ad directed at breastfeeding mothers (in some workplaces or public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The following is a translation of the Spanish version of the statement.
At the end of the video, the women are shown dancing with the discreetly placed bombs in their brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who use the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly worn inside the breastfeeding breasts, enabling mothers to move, hold onto their babies, and even walk outside with the breast pump on.
Ana Balarin, Member and ECD of Mother, says: “The Elvie Pump is a product that deserved a bold and provocative launch.
We wanted to show the parallel between cow and milk cow, and what we wanted to do was to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and its challenges, while also demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom that comes with the new breast pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has been used in the media.
During London Fashion Week, a mother with two children walked the runway for the designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Centenars of illegal immigrants are being held in a Texas border camp
The number of illegal immigrants detained has experienced a dramatic increase, despite the monthly flow of illegal immigrants into the border area having remained at a level that is usually.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors, who were also illegal immigrants in their day, feared that the proposal to welcome a child would put their own immigration status in jeopardy.
This risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that all potential sponsors and other family members of the child's would be required to submit their fingerprints and data would be shared with immigration agencies.
The week before, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration official, testified before Congress that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had arrested hundreds of illegal aliens who had requested to sponsor children.
The agency confirmed that only a small percentage of those arrested had criminal records.
Around 80% of sponsors or their relatives are illegal immigrants, and a large part of them are criminals.
We are still pursuing these people.
In their efforts to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear before the court in a maximum of one month from the time of their arrest, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule.
Many of them will testify by video conferencing, rather than in person, before an immigration judge to defend their legal status.
Those who are not considered suitable for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to workers at the shelters and the system reports that have recently appeared, as long as they are held under detention, there is a greater chance that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the advocates, these concerns increase as the facilities get larger, such as the Tornillo facility where it is more likely that, because of its size, the indicators of distress in these children will be overlooked.
Additionally, the transfer to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends is likely to cause them to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder.
Syria requests that the occupation forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moalem also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the eight-year-old Syrian war.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces in Syria were illegally present in Syria under the pretext of combating terrorism and that the issue would be dealt with accordingly.
The UN Security Council must withdraw immediately and without conditions.
Moualem stressed that the “terrorist war in Syria is practically over” and that more than 360,000 people have died there since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said that Syria would continue to fight in this holy war until we have cleared all Syrian territories from terrorist groups and any foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily providing training and advising Arab and Kurdish forces who are fighting against the Assad government.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country devastated by war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were right for them to return and blamed “some western countries” for “irrational fears” that kept refugees from returning to the country.
We have requested international and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of refugees.
“They are politicizing a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they would not help rebuild Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition has been reached.
The UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold was an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major Syrian-Russian attack on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, has been clear that the agreement had clearly defined terms and expressed the hope that the military action will be focussed on the jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, is expected to convene shortly a new UN-committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a new constitution for post-war Syria and to lay the groundwork for free and fair elections.
Mr. Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be limited to reviewing the current constitution's articles and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, even if many liberal observers expect a quick end to his presidency.
This would be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!
The audience is still very much alive.
Since 2014, the ratings for the top-rated news programs on CNN and MSNBC have more than doubled to 1.05 million and more than tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in its primetime slot, compared with 1.7 million viewers in the same time slot four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's “Rachel Maddow” show has surpassed cable's top news programs with 3.5 million viewers for its main evening news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction that we haven’t yet understood”, says Neal Baer, the producer of “Designated Survivor”, a dramatic series on a secretary who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran playwright and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
I remember a trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why?
Because it makes me laugh, that’s why I like it.
The chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
It is obvious that the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the outcome of the case Roe v. Wade, the possibility of immigrant families to gather or the health of the global economy.
Undoubtedly, the most important thing is to unplug the wires.
However, the information exceeds the limits when you realize that you have spent six hours watching a panel of experts debate the use of “deep background” sources that Woodward used in his book “Fear”, the leather vest of Paul Manafort (“a pride of over-reaching,” in words of The Washington Post) and the horrific descriptions of Stormy Daniels of the anatomy of Trump.
I have no intention of seeing Super Mario again.

The money flows into the election of the House of Representatives' half-term elections
It is not a surprise that money is pouring into the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the congressional redistricting with two candidates seeking reelection for the same seat.
This Pittsburgh district, which was redrawn recently, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th Pennsylvania district, a district that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a campaign financing battle between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the National Republican Committee (NRC).
The name of Lamb was very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won by 20 points.
Democrats have a slight advantage over the Republicans.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but later backtracked.
The diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight refusal from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the management team of the Trump Organization was evicted.
The State Department officials decided to return the ambassadors to the United States of America's diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of recent decisions to recognize Taiwan.
But only El Salvador, which had already received a grant of around 140 million U.S. dollars from the United States, was sanctioned for, among other things, drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial and visa restrictions, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the talks continued, officials from the United States and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar conference held the year before, which was viewed as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, the top officials in the administration had made clear that their intention was that the conference should continue, and that any sanctions against El Salvador would be dropped.
Vice President Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October and is seen as a sign of the administration's importance of the meeting.
The three American diplomats returned to the United States, Canada and Panama without new threats or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House denied commenting on the details of the debate described by the three US diplomats, including two ambassadors, who agreed to keep the discussions confidential.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst, who also spoke anonymously.
The study of history
The next step would be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, of which there are compelling public records.
It is also believed that Mueller is investigating whether the Trump campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If the House changes hands, Trump will be forced to answer to that chamber, just as he is preparing to run for re-election, and perhaps also to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional clauses, and with it I don't suggest that the Trump fall is inevitable, nor the equivalents in Europe.
We will have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the war.
In 1938, German officers were ready to give a coup d&apos;etat against Hitler. Only a resistance from the West and support for Czechoslovaks in Munich would have been enough.
We failed and we lost the chance to avoid the carnage that followed.
The history of the world has been shaped by these turning points, and the march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will happen if Trump fires the U.S. attorney general, the man who controls the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been seen as a good choice for the job since this newspaper reported that he had suggested secretly to the president that he was unfit to hold the office.
Rosenstein said that the Times' explanation is wrong.
“How will we respond if the new F.B.I. request for Brett Kavanaugh’s investigation is incomplete or unfair, or if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony, and if he is acquitted of these charges?
We also have to consider the possibility of voting on the midterm elections in the House of Representatives.
If we fail these tests, we will find ourselves in a long winter of political instability.
But I learned a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my house as an ambassador.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Shabbat candles on the same table where an eagle was painted.
With that heritage, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday against Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify in the Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that the result can be used as a springboard for bigger things.
We managed to get a good point, as Villarreal is a good team.
We started the game believing we could do something and we ended up with a draw.
Maybe we could have won, but we couldn't have achieved victory at the end, but we could have achieved a draw.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went all out and were the best team.
We'll have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve a win, but it will be a tough game because they got a good result in the last game. But, with our supporters behind us, I am sure we will be able to progress and obtain a positive result.
The year last year was a tough one for me with injuries and club changes, but now I feel that everything will be alright.
The team is feeling great, the kids are enjoying themselves and they are having a great training.
I have the hope that we can overcome the past season and move on to the next chapter.
The fear of retirement is keeping some women awake at night
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their families.
About half of those who participated in the Nationwide Study said they spoke with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they spoke to their children about the topic.
“People want to be cared for by a relative, but they are not talking about the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare your family to look after you if you don't tell them with enough time.
Work with your healthcare provider and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as that can be a factor in the cost.
Incorpore a his financial advisor, as he can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Sus options for long-term care can include a traditional insurance policy, a life insurance policy with cash value, or you can self-insure yourself with your own savings.
Find your way to the legal battles: be ahead of the law.
Be responsible for obtaining a medical power of attorney to appoint a trusted person to oversee his or her medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals are compliant with his or her wishes if he or she cannot communicate.
You can also prepare a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
Select a trusted person to take financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become disabled.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer the questions about medicines and allergies?
Further details should be included in a written plan to ensure that the system is always ready.
“It is not just the finances that are at stake: what about the doctors?” asks Martin.
What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to plan everything out.
Shoot a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They shot a man with a rifle while he was walking home after dark.
The victim, a man of around 40 years, was shot in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police described the shooting as an "accidental" shooting.
The victim did not see the assailant.
The injuries are not fatal and the police have made a plea for witnesses.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu on Friday, officials said.
With communications blocked, officials of assistance have not been able to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, a northern area that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay in the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency is a regency that extends along more than 300 kilometers (190 miles) of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a lower administrative unit below the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by earthquakes several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a massive tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west coast of Dongola in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area with a high earthquake risk.
The following is a list of earthquakes and earthquakes in recent years.
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of Aceh province in North Sumatra, Indonesia, on 26 December 2004, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coast.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in March and April.
There were hundreds of deaths on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A major earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the south of Java, the island with the largest population in Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that killed more than 700 people.
2009: A major earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
There were more than 1,100 deaths.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres high that destroyed hundreds of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing panic and destruction to remember the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of earthquakes of great magnitude that caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many buildings and tens of thousands of tourists were evacuated.
The elder son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, and a resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a state police report published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known victim tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
A Palin was detained in pretrial detention in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held with a $500 non-guaranteed bond, reported KTUU.
He was presented before the court on Saturday, where he was acquitted "definitively" when asked to give a statement.
Palin is charged with three misdemeanor crimes, which carry a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a misdemeanor offense of Class B, with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, Todd Palin was accused of assaulting his father.
Mrs. Palin called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and of possessing a firearm in a drunken state, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend said that he had been punched in the face.
Various veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking the violent behavior of her son to posttraumatic stress disorder arising from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A major earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power grid and telecommunications networks have all collapsed and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just outside the Sulawesi earthquake center, which is located in the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos on the internet that show the moment of impact.
Centenars of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit.
The United States Attorney's Office seeks the death penalty for terrorism suspects
The New York State Attorney General is seeking the death penalty for suspected terrorist Sayfullo Saipov, who was charged with eight murders in the city of New York.
Saipov, 30, alleged to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October 18th bicycle attack on the West Side of Manhattan's Fifth Avenue.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight people and caused serious bodily injury, according to the request for a death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death sentence, as per the document.
About a month after the shooting, a grand jury federal filed a 22-count indictment against Saipov for eight counts of murder and one count of terrorism.
The attack required a plan and premeditated planning, according to the prosecution, which described the man's "atrocious and depraved" plan.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.”
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been 10 years since the last time the South Bronx District in New York City prosecuted a death penalty case.
Khalid Barnes, the accused, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time that a federal death penalty was carried out in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electrocution on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he was feeling good about what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told investigators that he had been inspired by watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also requested that the flag of ISIS be flown in his room at the hospital.
The court has found that the defendant is not guilty of the charges against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defender lawyers who represent Saipov, said he was “deeply disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea with a mandatory sentence of life without possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved.”
The defense team had requested that the death penalty be denied.
MPs say NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage promised to mobilise the people's army today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to feel the heat of the Eurosceptics, while one of the MPs for Theresa May suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would have already left the EU if Farage had been Foreign Secretary.
But the challenge facing the First Minister Theresa May to reconcile divided Tory ranks has highlighted even more when a group of Conservative MPs in favour of remaining in the European Union have joined a protest against the Brexit in the city.
The PM is fighting to keep the Chequers deal in place, under fire from both the Leave campaigners and the EU’s opponents.
The allies insisted on reaching a compromise with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and chaos.
The MP said in the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given a role in the talks with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have already left.
Member of Parliament for Wellingborough, Mr. Sturgeon, said: “I will defend the Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.”
We have fought in wars to be subservient to others.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejected suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British public has changed its mind and wants to stay in the European Union is completely false.”
The Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the protest, where she said to the media: "First Minister, listen to the people.
The public at large does not like the plan, the opposition does not support it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually get out and vote for us first.
Forget about Chequers and start listening to the newly released Spanish version.
The first ministers retain their posts when they make their promises.
Farage said that it would be necessary to make the heat feel to politicians if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
Now it is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to say to them that we will not let them out”.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: “Let our political class, who are about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.”
“We will mobilise the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory with the Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom”.
Meanwhile, supporters of the Remain campaign marched through Birmingham's city centre before the rally in the city centre.
Some Tory activists waving Tory flags after the group's presentation this weekend.
Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for their security problems at the opening of the conference.
“These are the same people who say they can implement computer systems and all the technology to Canada Plus Plus, to harmonious border, to free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total hoax.
There is no good Brexit.
Warren considers all options for the presidency.
Senator Warren says she will consider all options after the election.
The Boston Globe reports that Democratic Governor Deval Patrick spoke at a city council meeting in the west side of the state.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the state representative, who was co-chair of the campaign of Massachusetts for Trump in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation that Warren will challenge Trump in 2020.
The event in the afternoon of Saturday in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with the voters using the municipal format since he took office.
A question was asked to the assembly as to whether he was interested in running for the presidency.
Warren said that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that it would be wise for there to be a woman in the highest office.
A sus 17 años, el jugador del LSU Sims fue arrestado por el asesinato con arma de fuego de un compañero de equipo.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced this Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department arrested Dyteon Simpson, 20, in a news conference at 11:00 am.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead in a drive-by shooting in the early hours of Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury that eventually led to his death”, said Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, 247sports.
Wayde was to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Simpson, a native of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, played 32 games in the 2010–11 season, starting in 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Hamilton overtakes Vettel for the World Drivers' Championship after team orders handed him the win
Since the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes would have a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and almost forgotten Hamilton by defending his position in the first two laps.
Vettel was the first to enter the pits and let Hamilton lead the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came with force a lap later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a close action with the wheels almost touching that made the Ferrari driver reluctant to give way after a double movement to defend himself after a third corner incident.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on this day, started from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap.
After leading a large part of the race, he led the race until he ran out of fuel and was overtaken by Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered the pits at the 44th lap, but could not increase his pace in the last eight laps.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job on Sunday.
The team has done a great job in finding a perfect mate.
That was a bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she did not leak the Christine Blasey Ford letter in which she accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he did say that what was going on in the Senate showed that there was “bad, repugnant and false people”.
“Only one thing that could happen and what is happening these last days in the Senate, is when you see the rage, when you see people who are bad, repulsive and false.
“When you read the publications and the leak, and then they say “But I did not do it.
I did not do it.
Do you remember?
Did you filter it?
Did you filter the document? - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not leak it.
Okay, wait a minute.
We have filtered it out, but we have not edited it.
A Feinstein sent the letter in which Ford detailed the allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was leaked to the press in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I did not hide the allegations of the Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, as reported by The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I did so.”
But his refusal to accept the invitation seemed to have been a poor choice.
I don’t know, but I think he didn’t do it, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.
Continuing with his defense of the nominee of the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations against the nominee to their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see evil and repulsion, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday in the Elite League by beating the Belfast Giants 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants took a two-goal lead through goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the lead with a one-run lead in the fourth quarter, but Dwyer restored the Giants' lead with a two-run shot in the ninth.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lundvall's two goals secured their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast last night.
The fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the three previous games.
The first goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute (3:35) with an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In the first period, the team was very enthusiastic, and Sullivan returned the team to the game in the 13th minute before Marquardt assisted on Cownie's goal in the 15th minute.
Dwyer secured a lead before halftime when he scored his second goal in the first half.
The home team re-grouped and Bouchard scored once again in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Corcoran helped Dundee lead for the first time in the game at half time and secured the win with the fifth goal in their favour as the game drew to a close.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, play host to Milton Keynes in their next match.
A pilot dies in a plane crash in the aftermath of the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after saving a plane that was about to crash.
Over 800 people died and many were missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, causing a massive tsunami.
The strong earthquakes are still raging and many are trapped in the rubble in Palu.
Despite the other passengers fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu control tower.
She remained firm in her decision to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321 could take off safely.
After the tower controller jumped out of the traffic control tower, he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian aviation minister, Yohanes Sirait, said the decision to cancel the search for the missing plane was a "stupid" decision, reporting the Associated Press.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter arrived.
Our hearts break when we hear this.
While the death toll is yet to be determined, the authorities fear that the number of dead could reach several thousand people. The national disaster management agency says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the rubble and it was not possible to reach out to a lot of people.
A wave of six metres has devastated Palu, which is holding a memorial service on Sunday.
The supplies and equipment are being flown in by military and commercial aircraft.
Mrs. Kusuma, a mother of 35, said to Sky News: “Each minute comes a ambulance with more bodies.”
Water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "We are trying to help all possible survivors, but we don't know what they will find there"
This is a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.
President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the army: “All you have to do is work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are they ready?
Indonesia had been struck by earthquakes in the early months of this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after an air crash in Micronesia
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lake in the Pacific Ocean, now says that a man is missing after having said that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the aircraft safely.
The Government of the Solomon Islands said on Saturday that it was unable to give information on a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond to the requests for more details about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Ships from the local island were used to help rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the sea while attempting to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities said they had transferred seven people to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital and all were in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lake before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had landed.
The American passenger, Mr. Bill Jaynes, said that the plane landed low.
That is a good thing to say.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers had made it to the emergency exits, but that they had to jump from the plane to escape the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were frightened and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said its sailors who were working on a dock also helped in the rescue by using a boat inflatable to carry people ashore before the plane sank some 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
The data on the aviation safety net indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned at the stake
The prosecution finished its opening arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of murdering a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst from the United States Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained how he used the mobile phone records to tie the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received the location data of several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting earlier statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford sat on the bench on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis said the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Tellis said he was lying, because his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records showed that they met only a week before.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis removed all contact information, messages and calls from Chambers' phone.
“He erased her from his life”, said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be completed by noon on the same day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-Hop Consciousness?
A trio of hip-hop artists want to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of hip-hop.
The High Breed, de Bristol, claims that hip hop has drifted from its original political and social messages.
They want to return to their roots and make hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing after posting a racist tweet
A New York nanny sued a couple for wrongful dismissal after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was being treated as a “negro”.
The couple denies that it is racist and compares it to a case of extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her shock at discovering that the new day care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO OTHER BLACK PERSON”, wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to his husband, he sent it to Maurice twice.
After being told of his mistake, a disgruntled Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, saying that his former nanny, an African American, had done a poor job and that he was looking for a Filipina nanny.
Mr. Maurice received his pay for a day's work and sent it home.
Mr. Maurice is now suing the employer for compensation for the six-month position Maurice had been hired for, but without a contract.
“I want to show them that things are not always done that way”, he said to The Post on Friday and added that “I know it’s a case of discrimination”.
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable thing to do, as they feared she would not be able to trust them again after she had insulted them.
My wife sent me a note that I could not accept.
She is not racist.
We are not racists,” said husband Joel Plasco.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone who has been rude to you, even though it was an accident?
Do you have a newborn baby?
Hello!
Comparing the demand as an “extortion”, Plasco said his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a “very difficult” situation.
Do you plan to go with someone else?
It is not that it is a very decent thing to do.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion has already begun to criticise the couple for their behaviour and their logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, so they decided to use a talking bear instead.
Karen Jankel, daughter of Bond, who was born after the book was accepted, said: “It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before its publication.
It is very funny to know what we know now about the success of Paddington.
After saying that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he inspired himself to write for children's books, trusted that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something “agridulce” after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family”, said that her father was very proud of his son’s success.
He was a very quiet man and he didn't like to show off.
But Paddington was so proud of his son, that he was proud of him, even though he was not really his own achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
At landing, her daughter was transferred to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to succeed.”
“I received a call from Nad to say that she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it.
I said to him: "I love you, dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him to keep his heart beating slowly and depleted his system.
She had died before she was old and everything was fading.
I could sit there and wait and watch it all happen, knowing that it was happening.
I couldn't howl, cry or moan because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to be firm.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering for the loss of her daughter, embarked on the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was about to endure.
No one knew it.
I fell to my knees and cried all the time.
It was difficult to explain, but I felt a profound sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved him.
Women in mourning put cards on bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from jumping off.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and numbers of which people can call to request help.
Tyler, the son of the Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day.
Davis, 45, and living in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
All knew him by his smile.
Always said that his smile brightened any place.
However, he left work before he died, as he was in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
I am concerned that it may have negative repercussions.
Davis created the cards to make sure people know that there are people you can call and talk to, even if they are a friend.
Don't be afraid to speak up, you have to speak up.
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Davies' friend since a long time, lost her partner Mark, her partner with whom she had been living for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
He didn't say he was depressed or anything like that.
About a week before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas Day came to a low point on Christmas Day.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they must overcome it: "He left a big emptiness in the family.
He is deeply saddened by the death of his father.
But we must continue to fight.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is hanging by a thread.
“I thought we could get something like what I was asking (a limited-time, scope-limited investigation), perhaps we could bring a little bit of unity,” said Sen. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “splitting up” in the middle of a partisan freeze.
Why did the Republicans in Congress not want to investigate the FBI's handling of the Watergate scandal?
The refusal of the request is due to the chronology.
Five weeks from the midterm elections, November 6, are left. If the Republicans have a bad showing, their efforts to secure the election of the man they want for the Supreme Court will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife, who was the personal secretary to the President.
What happens when the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of defectors from North Korea falls as the UN Security Council meets
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 desertions in 2012, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that border controls between North Korea and China, and high fees charged by traffickers were the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public statement on the issue.
Most of the deserters from the north who have been offered South Korean citizenship have accepted it.
Syria says that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the refugees flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China believes that illegal immigrants are illegal immigrants rather than refugees.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in war, have improved considerably in the last months.
At the beginning of this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have discussions on the nuclear disarmament talks.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between the president of the United States Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work towards a free of nuclear weapons-free Korea.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
“Without the trust of the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally.
Nancy Pelosi calls the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader of the House, said that the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a “histrionic” and that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Mrs. Pelosi made these comments in an interview with the Austin Tribune Festival.
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted in that way, they would have said she was a histrion,” said Pelosi on Thursday as Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh served up emotion to deny the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when she was a teenager.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming and choking while he spoke of his childhood and his years of high school.
In the committee, also condemned explicitly the Democrats, accusing them of “grotesque and clearly coordinated defamation” of Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 presidential election.
Senator Pelosi said that, in her opinion, the testimony of Kavanaugh showed that he was not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, because he showed partisan bias against Democrats.
I think he has himself disqualified himself by making those statements and the way he has pursued the Clinton case.
Pelosi put her objections when asked if she would challenge Kavanaugh in the case he was confirmed and if Democrats obtained a majority in the House.
“Only one thing: if he is lying to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court in which he is now sitting.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh sentences against the Affordable Care Act or the Case Roe against Wade, which she considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a non-impartial person to go to court and expect us to find everything is fine.”
And women have to take the initiative.
It is a diatribe, and it is a long one, and it is not easy to stop it.
We cry when we angered.
I don’t think it’s so unusual, does that sound like a lot of fun?
She followed talking: “I was helped by a woman who was an executive in some company and she told me that she too cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was speaking: “Maybe you think I am sad because I am crying.
I'm not happy.
And then I went to the kitchen and cooked a meal.
I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed because they are a natural and normal part of grief.
One of the clearest memories I have from my first job, in a man-dominated office, was once when I was crying with an unexpressed rage. A woman older, a manager who always had a slight fear of me, grabbed me by the nape of my neck and pulled me up the stairs.
Don't let them see you cry.
You don't know what angry you are.
They think you are sad because you have been cornered.
Patricia Schroeder, who then was a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up in an extramarital affair aboard a cruise ship called Monkey Business by which he had to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea that she should run for the presidency.
It wasn't premeditated, but it was a very good idea.
There were seven candidates in the race and the last one needed was a woman.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
The campaign was already well under way, so he was left behind in the fundraising race, so he was not going to enter the race again until he had raised two million dollars.
It was a lost cause.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave $1000 to the men, she only received $250.
Do they think I have a discount?
When she delivered her speech announcing that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise funds and to win delegates, and rage at sexism).
It would have been logical to have thought that he had a nervous breakdown.
You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember I thought, what will be written on my tombstone?
Does she cry?
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit China
The first round of trade war between the United States and China was loud and unexpected, and although the battle is still ongoing, a breakdown between the countries could benefit Beijing, say experts.
President Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning in early 2017 by imposing tariffs on Chinese solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant new tax increase this week was a 200,000 million dollar (150,000 million pounds) tax on imports, which is expected to double the tax burden on half of the goods entering from China.
Beijing has taken retaliatory measures, applying a five to ten percent duty on U.S. products for a total value of $60 billion.
China has committed to matching the U.S.'s attacks, and it is unlikely that China will soon be willing to relax its policy.
To make China backtrack would mean Washington would have to give up on its demands, but publicly submitting to China would be too shameful for the president Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say Beijing is playing its cards well, and if it plays them well, the war trade wars could help China to long-term prosperity.
“The prospect of a quick decision in Washington or Beijing that can lead to a slide into a deep recession in either country is much more dangerous than the public has realized so far,” said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to send home refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria is ready to accept voluntary repatriation of refugees and requests assistance for reconstruction of the country devastated by a seven-year war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Moualem said the conditions in the country were improving.
The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure than it was before the war.
The government is repairing the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to flee the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their lives and their means of livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that, since the beginning of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
The Syrian government appreciated the assistance offered by the United Nations.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe is making the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats in Europe since the last time it won the Ryder Cup in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish team captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for much of the tournament, threw his ball into the water at the par-3 16th hole, admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was the only player to achieve a 5-0-0 in all his rounds, one of only four players to do so since the current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell to the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson fell to No. 2 Ian Poulter in a one-sided final round.
Spanish: 
I don't cry, but I'm crying now.
It has been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to have been able to recover the cup.
It is a team achievement for the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help.
Now the torch is handed over to his compatriot John Rahm, who already beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods in a singles match.
I feel a tremendous amount of pride to have beaten Tiger Woods, as I have watched him grow up.
Woods lost four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his career of the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the all-time great players, who has won 14 major titles, placing him behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight hard to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a superb level of golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk talked about the disappointing performance of his team: "I'm very proud of these guys, they never gave up.
There was a time when we were warming up for the upcoming meeting.
But we lost it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
The team played a good game.
We will gather, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will continue on.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now we have to bend our heads.
We have been overtaken.
Red tide: Drought in the Gulf of Mexico is beginning to subside
The new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission) shows a reduction in the concentrations of red tide in areas of the Bay of Tampa.
According to the FWC, there are reports of irregular bloom conditions in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which suggests a decline in concentrations.
The bloom of the red tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from the county of Pinellas in the north to the county of Lee in the south.
There are irregular parcels of land in the county of Hillsborough, but there are fewer than in the week before.
The fisherman's wife was also infected with the disease.
During the week of June 1, 2010, there have been reported concentrations in the following counties: Pinellas County and its coast, low concentrations in the Hillsborough County coast, high concentrations in the Hillsborough County coast, low concentrations in the Manatee County coast, high concentrations in the Manatee County coast, high concentrations in the Sarasota County coast, high concentrations in the Charlotte County coast, high concentrations in the Lee County coast, and low concentrations in the Collier County coast.
The following is a list of the most common diseases reported in the United States in the past year.
There have been no reported cases of respiratory irritation in the northwest Florida area during the past week.
