The Members of the Welsh Assembly (AMs) are concerned that they will look like "muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for short).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the House from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Member of the House of Commons said that his group was concerned that it would be "Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: twp means twat and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that his group was "disappointed" and has suggested alternatives.
A Conservative member of the Welsh Assembly stated that his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the leap from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Commission on the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any element of the descriptive name of Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
The 2017 Act of the National Assembly for Wales gave the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed widespread support for a devolved Parliament for Wales.
On the question of the title of Members of the European Parliament, the Commission opted for Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but MWP was the preferred option in a public consultation.
The options suggested by the Members of the Assembly are being considered, but the fight for consensus could prove to be a headache for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to send the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes related to the operation of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
The Members of the Assembly will have the final say on how the legislation should be named when they decide on the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the country's name change
Voters will be asked on Sunday whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with the country neighbour, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent for the difficulties of Harlem churches
“Historically, older people I have spoken to say that there was a pub and a church on every corner,” he says.
There is no longer any question of either/or.
He said that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
People now socialize in other ways.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods to which people go regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "at some point, they will come back to square one."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who would not help the sanctuaries that remained in the neighbourhood.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, and so they will accelerate the closing of these churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the AME in 1870 and St. Martin in 1880.
The original white Methodist congregation was founded in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped there acquired the building.
A black congregation took over the leadership of San Martín, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks.
In 1939, a fire had left the building severely damaged and, while the congregation of Father Johnson was planning for its reconstruction, they also ordered the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martín, was proud to call them "the poor man's campaigns."
In July, the expert who struck the gong called it &quot; a cultural treasure &quot; and &quot; an irreplaceable historical instrument &quot;.
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church carillon, the largest in the world, 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather commented that St. Martin was not replaced.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the diocese.
The parish council, the lay governing body of the parish, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was &quot; trying to pass the costs &quot; on to the parish council, although the council had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiger shark injures 13-year-old boy while diving for abalone in California
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for abalone on Saturday, the first day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, so he swam over with a group to rescue him.
Hammel commented that he initially thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then realized he was screaming because he had been bitten.
Hammel noted that the boy had a broken collarbone.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark,” he added.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain, Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area some weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there were more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's beauty plans are driving the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's has acquired Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist employees in their style and beauty aisles.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at £2.8 billion and growing at a faster rate than fashion and home sales, the largest beauty halls in the country will be trialled in 11 stores and, if successful, rolled out to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space on shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique range with a majority of products that are animal-friendly, something that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be trialling its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second of which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift towards buying small amounts of food in local shops every day force supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said that the chain's stores will look more like shopping malls as it tries to compete with discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points into hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat outlets since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is believed that this has driven food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a disagreement over how to split the proceeds from the Boots pharmacy sales in their supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of 281 Sainsbury's pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will be participating in the scheme, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, commented: &quot; We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to make them more appealing to our customers.
We have also invested in a dedicated team of advisers who will be available to offer advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to meet all needs, and a comfortable environment and convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is “furious” after Holly Willoughby breaks a 11 million pound deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, was “furious” after television presenter Holly Willoughby broke an agreement worth £11 million with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the latest fashion and accessories.
This business had compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby, 37, announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks &amp; Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the TV presenter admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for her Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting at her corporate headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was set to double Willoughby's fortune of around £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain for one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Truly, it was Holly's main priority.
It was to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
Their decision to leave left everyone involved completely stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters, ready to be put on sale.
The experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of pounds due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and sails to clothing, and possibly delay its launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 and Jones, who is 52, joined as president in March.
The couple were on holiday together and Jones has a 40 % stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become the face of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that “no business was discussed last night.”
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some might consider &quot; too presidential &quot; and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his mock-newsman voice.
“I have not given up anything.”
Kim is interested in meeting again with Trump after Trump praised the first meeting in Singapore as a great step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world’s leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country has not seen an “adequate response” from the United States to its first steps towards denuclearization.
The United States, on the other hand, continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's speech was much more optimistic than the one he gave during his rally.
We get on well with North Korea.
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: the end of missile tests, help in freeing hostages and bringing the remains of American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
It is very easy to be president, but instead of 10 000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we would have 200 people here, he said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
It is regrettable that in many cases they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a little.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palu, it is still not certain that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations could be allowed to provide assistance.
Given that the land in Indonesia is constantly shifting, the country is still woefully unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami sirens in Palu, even with an advance warning, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
Traveling from one island of Indonesia to another is a major challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate the logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has made the upgrading of Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is facing re-election next year.
It must also contend with the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, equals the mark against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at something like 27 metres from the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot and then kicked it.
The action was sent over the area and headed towards the upper right corner of the network.
The ball then passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap, and fell into the net.
Sturridge was attempting to get into position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible.
I saw Kante coming and gave him a nudge. I didn't think about it too much, I just fired.
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues's mediapunta made a pass to Mateo Kovacic in that move, before turning and playing a pass into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle.
After that, he made a nice tour of the area that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and he shot the ball into the net with his left foot, with a kick that Alisson Becker, from Liverpool, could not stop.
Liverpool plays Napoli on Wednesday, 15:00, in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Indonesian emergency agency on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday, which sent waves up to six metres high, according to the spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested by the police as a suspect in the murder of a woman who was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7.55 a.m. on Grayson Mews, in John Street, leading to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect in her murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
I would also recommend to any person, especially taxi drivers, who may have been able to capture something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.
A spokesman for Merseyside Police has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found on the inside of a property.
Some people who knew the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have informed that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives at 5 Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police say nobody can enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to discover what had happened.
Residents are informed that they will be allowed to return in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was found crying at the scene.
It is always the same story.
At 2 p.m., there were two police cars inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents were standing guard inside the cordon, monitoring the floor block.
Any person with information is requested to send an e-mail to DM @MerPolCC, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or register at 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell statue at Parliament becomes latest commemorative success with'rewriting history'
The ban would be poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious artefacts in England by its puritanical fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestions of Mr Crick as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure from the Palace of Westminster would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
It may be necessary to sacrifice the wrong Cromwell in order to avenge the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, a century earlier.
The magnificent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a testament to the opinion of the nineteenth century and to the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: 'Many people consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, the monarchy.
If the description is completely accurate, it is a matter for further debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure that represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of commemoration and celebration.
A pig killer attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a livestock dealer at a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He apparently travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 cows at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby shed was open.
He said that there was a great pig with blood on its snout.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig had been killed by the farmer.
The legs of my cousin were bleeding and broken, he said, and his name is Wu.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was kept in a pen to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
It appears that the family of Yuan and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although it is rare, pigs have attacked people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms had cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it away.
After pigs ate a pig farmer in Oregon in 2012, a pig farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to do harm.
What we need to do is to have the appropriate respect for them,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rain across the south-west of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern Mexican coast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the northern part of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa produced winds of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, from Sunday morning (Eastern time) to Monday morning (Eastern time) and was located about 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, a low pressure system is moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States, and a tropical storm is expected to develop by Monday, pushing heavy tropical rains northward towards the south-west United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain hits the low pressure system that is approaching, there will be heavy rain in the south-west for the next few days.
Between 2 and 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, mud flows and possible rock slides in the desert.
Tropical storm conditions are expected to produce rainfall rates of 5 to 8 cm per hour in specific areas, especially in portions of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in the greater part of Arizona.
Due to the nature of tropical rain, sudden and rapid flooding is possible.
In view of the threat of tropical rain, it is not recommended to go walking in the desert.
Heavy rains could turn the guns into rivers and storms could cause localised winds and dust clouds.
The approaching low pressure systems will bring heavy rain to parts of the south coast of California.
Heavy rainfalls of up to 2 cm may cause small flows of debris and make the roads slippery.
This would be the first heavy rain in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before becoming widespread by late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intense temperature changes will be observed in the United States in October as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
Sometimes, this means drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences will be seen across the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 g between Kansas City, Missouri and, Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the coming days, the summer heat will attempt to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures generally in the 80s from the South to parts of the north-east.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures could reach 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term outlook indicates above-normal temperatures for the eastern United States for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony
More than 20 million people watched the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the policy remained stalled and the media interrupted their regular programming to report the latest developments of Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona senator Jeff Blake to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while she was drunk and that he tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 per cent certain that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who saw the Nielsen report on Friday would have seen it.
The company counted the average audience for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels that retransmitted the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has some problems in calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a hearing similar to that of a football match in the playoffs or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh, led the pack, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had $3.1 million, NBC had $2.94 million, MSNBC had $2.89 million and CNN had $2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the hearing, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in the Friday drama.
After the Republican moderate office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing.
While receiving these criticisms, relayed live on CNN, he appeared to be abashed.
A woman looked me straight in the eye.
“Do you think he is telling the truth?”
He went on: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a press release and, before the doors of the lift closed, he would have more to say in his appearance before the Committee.
The cable and broadcast networks were all broadcasting everything live hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to nominate Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake took his decision.
The decision to call for an investigation was critical, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without it.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of "playing politics"
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, is due to arrive at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his own in the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to pay the other side’s tariffs was “completely absurd.”
Wayde murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player's death
A suspect has been arrested in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say that he admitted to having shot Wayde.
A bond of USD 350,000 has been established, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head that entered the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the police in the area for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade declared that his team is “devastated” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
These are the things that people always worry about, said Wade.
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
Ceniza from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighbourhoods south of Mexico City.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre registered several tremors and shakes.
The images showed layers of ash covering the windscreens of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have observed increased activity at the volcano, 72 km south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo," has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after anti-riot police clashed with pro-independence demonstrators as thousands of people took to the streets in opposition to the polarised first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and dust at the police, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in the hours that followed and the police used batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans such as "Neither forget nor forgive," faced off against unionists, who chanted "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatists celebrate.
The independence vote was won by a landslide, although the turnout was low, as many people who were against independence boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to stop the vote at polling stations throughout the region, where there were violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration went ahead, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost all hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year was one of our best years.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck in a jam.”
Despite winning a narrow victory in the regional elections in December, the pro-Kyrgyzstan parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
“It is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
Running for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government.
Londonderry: men arrested for crashing car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly crashing a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday at 19:30 on Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was caused to the accesses and the building itself.
At some point, the car may have been shot at with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Livingston secured victory with the first goal from Dolly Menga
A Livingston promotion impressed the Rangers into their second defeat for Steven Gerrard as manager of the club in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference. Gary Holt's goal put Hibs in second place.
This season, Gerrard &apos; s team have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table by eight points.
Previously, Rangers received Rapid Vienna on a Thursday in the Europa League.
While Livingston extended its winning streak to six games in the division, Holt, the team's head coach, has yet to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses out on opportunities in front of a powerful visitor
The Holt equipment had to have been in place much earlier, causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers with their direct approach.
Scott Robinson beat the defence, but his shot was deflected by Alan Lithgow after he had gone in for a header from Craig Halkett's cross in front of goal.
The host team let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-hogging.
That was how the decisive blow was struck.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston looked for an opening, with a combination of Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that time, Rangers were in control, but they were unable to get past the host and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, who was quite relaxed.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stoppage of play.
Allan McGregor, Rangers goalkeeper, blocked a Scott Pittman shot with his foot and Livingston missed another chance.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly being cleared, but two penalty claims were turned down, one for a Halkett handball and one for a Glenn Middleton substitute.
Livingston &apos; s &quot; Phenomenon &quot;
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A Livingston performance and result.
The general consensus is that they did a great job and exceeded expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and their personnel have hardly changed since their promotion, but this is largely down to Holt for the way he has bolstered the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was immense and led a magnificently organised defence, while Menga kept Joe Worrall and Joe Goldson on their toes at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good moments with Gerrard, they were short-lived.
They failed to execute the plays, as they only managed to get into the Rangers' half once, which is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received a mixed welcome in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday 29 September during breakfast for the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police cited security concerns to prevent 25 000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also spoke out against both his policies and the decision of the German government to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist killed after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, heading south towards the city, at 1015.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended to by the paramedics, but he died there and then.
The accident occurred after another cyclist was killed after being hit by a vehicle that drove off in Childers Street, about two kilometres from the site of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been blocked and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in disturbances
Six prison officials have been injured in a brawl in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison administration.
The disturbances began at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 9.30 a.m. on Sunday and are still continuing.
A special team of elite officers (known as “Tornado”) is in charge of monitoring the disturbances, which involve eight inmates and affect one wing.
The agents received assistance for minor injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: "Specialist staff from the prison have been deployed to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence and make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in prison.
Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, prison guards were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which inmates attacked prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep through the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona, southern Nevada and eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix commented on Twitter that “only 10 hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within 321 km of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of rain, with up to 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be 2 to 5 mm, with 10 mm possible in isolated areas, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places where there is no risk of flash floods, Rosa rains are a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, part of this torrential rain may be beneficial due to the current drought conditions in the south-west.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 % of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which is expected to become a hurricane by Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is now moving away from the Pacific, and is losing strength.
It is expected that the storm will hit Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rains are expected in parts of Mexico, which are at risk of flooding.
Weather.com reports that &quot; heavy rain is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm &quot;.
Rosa will then move northward as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression early Tuesday morning.
The main danger of Rosa or its remains is heavy rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora and south-west United States.
These storms are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects in a murder attempt after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he is &quot; stable &quot;.
Two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and the anger” of the Democratic Party
Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democrats' ruthless and nasty tactics, Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has “been through the mud and the muck” of the confirmation process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this allegation.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, “Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the courage” of Kavanaugh.
Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most successful legalists of our day, a jurist with an admirable record of service to the public.
The president made indirect references to the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not standing, but I am running the race.
That is why I go from one place to another, fighting for great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats are engaged in a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that hit the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres came ashore in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When a tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, everything on land, said Nugroho.
He added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, bridges that had collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The BPPT has informed the public that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is situated at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant," saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage could be higher along 300 km of coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications &quot; were completely down and there was no information &quot; from Donggala, he said.
More than 300 000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse.
The agency was heavily criticised for failing to inform of the tsunami that struck Palu, although the agency claims that the waves had already reached the coast by the time the alert was issued.
In a video shot by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard warning people on the street below that a tsunami is approaching.
In minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout in the area around Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The airport in the city has been reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a visit scheduled to the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala have arrived safely in Palu, where they are sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastated landscape on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
He said that they had seen many houses destroyed.
This is very bad.
Even as the aid groups were putting the wheels in motion, some people were complaining that experienced aid workers were not being allowed into Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign financing, supplies and personnel can be used if the site is declared a national disaster area.
And that has not yet happened.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the Government says that it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but it has not happened yet.
Friends and family of the missing still hoped for a miracle that would bring some light to the stories of the natural disasters.
A small child was pulled from a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had been held earlier that month in Indonesia.
Some of the students who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“Based on my experience in the world of paragliding, I carry my own emotional baggage,” he said.
The hotel manager, Mr Gendon, recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the parapente community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were taking part in the beach festival.
However, their messages only showed a grey mark of verification, not two blue ones.
I believe that this means that the messages were not delivered.
Thieves stole $26,750 from an automated teller machine at Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, a Brink employee was robbed of $26,750 while refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM machine located in the entertainment centre and was preparing to reload it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man “came running up behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money that was to be reloaded.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person with information on the identities of the deceased should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West will now be known as Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, who is 41, has been known as Ye for some time now, as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
She was replaced by the creator of the programme, who cited "emotional reasons" for her cancellation.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name, West had said previously that the word had a religious importance for him.
I think it is the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West said earlier this year while talking about the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, means we.
It went from being Kanye, which means 'the only one', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without guion.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador pledged in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the student movements of the left were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly stipends to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I. A.
As China is becoming more active in AI, the United States should double its investment in AI research, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by several parts of the US Government, including when the US does not have an official I. A. strategy.
While China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
Duplicating the budget for I. A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the United States, says Lee.
Double the funding means double the chances of the next great I. A. achievement in the U. S., as Lee declared in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book &quot; AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order &quot; was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China &apos; s most important I. A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on a system at Carnegie Mellon University that defeated the best American player of Othello. He was subsequently an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
He acknowledged previous competitions run by the US Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
It is not China that is taking the leaders; it is the corporations.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent academics to work on I. A.
He commented that changes in US migration policy could also help to intensify US efforts in Iraq.
I think that doctors in I. A. should be given permanent residence cards automatically.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
The United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center in January 2012, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence in February 2012.
In addition, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 million per year in research on I. A.
Meanwhile, the United States has been unable to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its candidacy for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents maintain that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Slav population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50 % required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum question was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies like the EU and NATO.
I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, to live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all.
Although the vote will not be legally binding, many Members have said that they will respect the result of the vote as decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared that, at 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, the turnout was only 16 %, compared with 34 % in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopie.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents set up by those who were boycotting the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not by the back door.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, they can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that joining NATO would bring the investment Macedonia so desperately needs, with an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
I believe that the great majority will be in favour, as more than 80 % of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said that a positive result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Studies suggested that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which would fall short of the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57 per cent of those polled intended to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 % said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50 % plus one.
If this fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, evades the whole Brighton defence to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling scored in the 2-0 win for Manchester City over Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian midfielder received a yellow card at the start of the match.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking into open country.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded one defence before outrunning several more on the Brighton seafront.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who struck it with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan with a shot that went to the right side of the goal.
“Agüero has some problems with his ankle,” Pep Guardiola, City's manager, told the press.
We are talking about 55 to 60 minutes of play.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave Sky Blue the initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton goal.
He made a lovely pass to Leroy Sane on the left flank.
Sane gave Sterling a few touches before directing him to the second mast.
The Sky blues forward launched the ball into the box just before he was offside.
The City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday, 12:55 p.m. CET at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies' party
With the Nationals out of the playoff picture, there was no reason to force another opening.
However, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Los Angeles Dodgers, who defeated the Scherzer-led Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can go out there with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I have faced this year.
Why would anyone not want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it seems they are leaning towards leaving Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, had a practice session on Thursday and would return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The record of the Washington wizard is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 appearances.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation, his nomination to the Supreme Court, in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
Everything we have done is at stake in November.
There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is one of the most important. I do not stand for election, but I do go from one place to another, fighting for great candidates.
He went on: "We have this terrible group of radical democrats, they are now in power.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, and this is seen as meanness and malice.
They do not care who they hurt or step on to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control.
The Democrats, he said, were engaged in a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
“We have seen it these last four days,” he said, saying that the Democrats “were furious, were bad, were horrible and were false.”
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the Senate nominating the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Did you remember his answer?
Do you want to filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, ¿qué?
No, no mmm, I hope for a reply. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.
The Labour Party now encompasses a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour Members of Parliament to be told that I am not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way to being categorically anti-Semitic.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not being in agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
He was at odds with the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, for Europe. It was ironic that he was at odds with leaders on issues on which he had been at odds with previous leaders.
As the Labour Party East Nottingham East branch notice stated, "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a &quot; kinder and gentler &quot; policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever was applied at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to change his mind radically and to adopt positions with which he would never have been comfortable, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my removal, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one to have experienced this.
I am indeed fortunate to be in a position where I can afford to be more generous than some of my colleagues.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every motion for censure or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice to keep my head down and not make a fuss, and that I would be better off.
But I have not gone into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student at secondary school, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my school building literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to have been unaware of my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday that I do not understand these people's desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The message is not to Momentum, but to the electorate, be they Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal and no opportunism will stop me from acting in what I believe to be best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr invincible at the top
Two late goals may have decided the outcome, but Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Premiership match.
They are currently the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was the superior defence and ability to make the most of opportunities that gave the local team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
“We have been tested in all the ways and we are still standing, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, commented: "The Ayr deserves the recognition, they took the opportunities better than us."
The Grant Anderson try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, on loan from Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opposition and Jason Baggot managed to convert a penalty that was not converted.
Ayr took the lead in the first half with a penalty kick, and the score was 17-5 to Ayr at half-time.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be stretchered off, and, when the game resumed, Ayr took the lead with a Stafford McDowall try converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed them to get one more man with a Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals were recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Climo by Struan Hutchinson for pleasing Climo without the ball, from the line-out, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
The weather was, as it had been for most of the game, against them, after Kyle Rowe had received the ball from David Armstrong and sent it into the corner for Gregor Henry to head home for the fifth time from close range.
Still Game star Ford Kiernan wants to move into the catering business
Ford Kieran, who played the role of Jack in Still Game, appears to be determined to move into the catering business after being named as the new director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC programme, which he writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, it is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “booming Glasgow restaurant scene.”
“The sea is ours”: a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The naval headquarters in La Paz is monitored by sailors.
Blue flags are flown on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: &quot; The sea is ours by right,
It is a duty to recover it.
In Bolivia, a land without a sea, they still remember vividly the lost coast that was the scene of a bloody conflict over resources in the nineteenth century, and the longing to return to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia expects a ruling from the International Court of Justice by 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impulse, the spirit of unity and calm and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate for Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is locked in a controversial re-election battle next year, also has much to say about the resolution.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favour and that the situation would not change much if it did.
The UN agency with headquarters in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling came only six months after the final arguments indicated that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
The problem of access to the sea has been seized upon by the current Bolivian administration.
In addition, he suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue the conversation after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, rejected the idea that the court was unusually quick to make decisions.
On Monday, Bolivia will offer "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 years of mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
Bolivia would never renounce its right to access to the Pacific Ocean.
The resolution is an opportunity to look back and see what we need to leave behind.
North Korea says it will not give up nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly.
He urged the United States to live up to the pledges made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong U, which have been stalled for more than three months.
He said that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that would end the Korean War were a &quot; pipe dream &quot;.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without some meaningful movement on the part of Pyongyang.
Both Kim and the US president, Donald Trump, want to hold another summit.
There is widespread scepticism about whether Pyongyang will give up an arsenal that it probably regards as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the mandarins.
The latest Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of enormous hats that are about to land in a street shop near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large items included pineapples with jewels, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of outlandish masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-on lips and bore more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a full scuba kit, including mask and snorkel, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you are in luck.
Predictions are that the huge hats will start to appear in shops.
The big hats are back, with a wide-brimmed hat with a 60 cm-long brim, worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand behind this impractical hat that flooded social media also presented another creation on the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini.
The Jacquemus La Riviera orange-brown raffia bag, decorated with white leather straps and a white leather handle, was the main piece of the La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets. Since the designer has had such a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: linguistic skills are essential for citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the examinations that is further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for short), are striving to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for their place in the world.
As a sector that can design and implement a curriculum adapted to the needs of the modern world, modern languages are still popular and in demand in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he will listen to you.
If you speak to them in their language, you reach their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if one wants to establish relations and build trust with people from other countries, one cannot rely solely on English.
If we look at the results of the recent examinations, we can see that the languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
Overall, 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from 74 centres that are part of the SCIS, showed that 72 % of the students who studied Chinese obtained an A, while 72 % of the students who studied German, 69 % of the students who studied French and 63 % of the students who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that children and young people will need in the future without a doubt.
Languages are now considered to be on a par with the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 % of employers cited language skills as a barrier to filling jobs.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable for preparing young people for their future careers.
The opportunities for employment that require language skills are increasing, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career path someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people in foreign countries will give that person an automatic advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 % of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and 15 % spoke only French.
Investing in language education is therefore important for children today.
If children know several languages, especially those of developing economies, they will be better equipped to find better jobs.
In Scotland, different colleges will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more traditional modern languages, while others will teach the more important languages for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child's interests, independent schools will always offer a choice of several languages taught by specialist staff.
Independent schools in Scotland focus all their efforts on providing an environment of learning that prepares children for life and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future holds.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered &quot; skills for international communication &quot;.
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
One must do one's best.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent College Council.
LeBron James makes his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for LeBron James to make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Luke Walton, the Lakers &apos; head coach, has announced that James will play in the season opener against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
However, it is still unclear how many minutes the match will last.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton commented on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play a few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' preseason schedule.
In this stage of my career, I do not need pre-season friendlies to prepare myself.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump campaign events scheduled for next week, including stops in Trump-supporting places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his nominee for the Supreme Court in the balance, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the House of Representatives when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 this Saturday, 29 September 2018.
The event can be viewed online via a live YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to comment on the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings this week, which were marred by allegations of sexual misconduct and have left a Senate vote on confirmation on hold for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the republicans who are facing the November elections to gain momentum.
The Trump campaign has announced that the five rallies next week will "energize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House," according to Reuters.
The control of the Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the campaign, said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named.
The event scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage in Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday visit will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
For Morrisey, it is not good news that the president has to come and push him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows that it is prepared to fight to keep the flame of hope alive for the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be just what Ryder Cup needs.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept in sport, but the players really believe in it, even in competitions like this.
So where do you think the impetus is now?
We were six points ahead and now they are four points ahead, so I guess that is a little bit of a momentum shift.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points for twelve more on the board.
As Spieth points out, the Americans have plenty of reasons to be cheerful and plenty of reasons to be optimistic, not least the fact that Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day and managed to score three points between them.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and preaches by example.
The guttural cries of celebration rose in volume as they made their way around, introducing a vital putt for the fourth match when he and Thomas were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the win in the 15 was received with a similar yell, one that conveyed that they still believe that the American team is not out of it.
What is needed is a redoubling of efforts and a concentration on the task at hand.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes for tracks.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe are four of a kind and nothing can go wrong.
Moliwood was the only pair that did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
The way they play and the way they play with the crowd make them the players to beat on Sunday, and there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
It is preferable to have two holes dug in different locations.
It is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson paired up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A Spaniard and a Swede were buried in a hole in the ninth and tenth holes, respectively, and they were unable to get out.
But there will be no help on Sunday to get out of the holes.
The foursomes and foursomes are fascinating to watch because of the interplay between the partners, the advice that is given and the advice that is not given, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team is not afraid to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good lead going into the final day of the Ryder Cup, after the foursomes and fourballs were won 10-6 over the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the field with two wins over Tiger Woods, who was struggling, four points ahead in the Le Golf National standings.
Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many errors during the foursomes in the morning, which ended 3-1.
The United States fought back in the foursomes, winning two matches, but did not close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their formidable partnership helped to beat a despondent Woods and the American rookie Bryson DeChambeau by a convincing 5-4.
Woods, who has been in and out of the two parties this weekend, has had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 foursomes and fourballs, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the fourballs in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and number three players respectively, 2-1.
Although the weather was pleasant and calm in the south-west of Paris, Europe was not having an easy time of it.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference point for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They won a thrilling 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has recovered from a four-point deficit in the singles only twice, and Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to retain it.
Although they were the second best for two days, it seems that a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is "no possibility" of unilateral disarmament if they do not have confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Mr. Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that North Korea had adopted &quot; important good-will measures &quot; over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received any similar response from the United States.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances there is no possibility of us unilaterally disarming.
Although Ri repeated the well-known complaints of North Korea about Washington &apos; s resistance to a &quot; phased &quot; denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an American president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official goal of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can renounce them.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States has insisted on denuclearization first and has increased the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its coercive purpose, even objecting to a declaration of the end of the war.
The idea that sanctions can make us crawl on our knees is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our mistrust.
He made no mention of a second Trump-Kim summit, which was announced by the US President at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae, adding: "If South Korea had been the interested party in the denuclearization of the peninsula instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's, when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles towards US soil after "malignant" Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim "rocket man".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years, five years, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: &quot; The Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and fully enforced until we realize the final and fully verified denuclearization of North Korea &quot;.
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had been progress, but within hours North Korea had denounced its "demands as those of a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied “corresponding measures.”
He said that Kim had told him that the “measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep
Thanks to a new course that is being taught this year at Harvard University, all students are sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of all-night studying with caffeine.
A professor at the top university in the world discovered that students there often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The motivation for setting up the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she had only just found out about this now, in her final year.
He said that nobody had ever spoken to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course, which was introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos; s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only a few hours a week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a routine for going to bed.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After that, an icon of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that students will not change their behaviour overnight.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as everyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco.
He said that the culture of &quot; pulling an all-nighter &quot; still existed and added that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good night's sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
The next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by screens and LED lights, which can disrupt circadian rhythms, and thus make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another home defeat, when the attack of Dolly Menga saw the disjointed team of Steven Gerrard lose 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to get their first away win since February 4-1 against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard's team for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga's attack came just minutes before half-time and Rangers' poor shape was never going to be enough.
The Rangers dropped to sixth, Livingston to third, behind Hibernian by the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as judge of the line Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after allegedly being hit by an object from the visiting end.
Gerrard swapped eight of the players who won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt took 11 Livingston players off the pitch last week and would have been delighted with the way his organised team suffocated their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have marked the two minutes of the start, when Menga made a pass for Scott Pittman that went between the defence, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent him out.
Keaghan Jacobs took a deep breath to fire at Captain Craig Halket, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to fire it out the long barrel.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their chances in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored his request.
The Rangers got two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly was hardly troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute was a surprise, nobody can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
The Rangers were unable to cope with a deep ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to score.
In the rest period, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an immediate impact, as Morelos took over the ball and Kelly came out of his line to block it.
Livingston still kept the visitors exactly where he liked them, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing a path long enough for him to drive through.
Holt could have had the edge in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow got a head of steam on a corner that didn't come off.
The Rangers substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a confrontation with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the &quot; Sunday Morning &quot;, 30 September 1882, and containing... the future physical Johannes Wilhelm &quot; Hans &quot; Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that culminated in the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film &quot; The Singing Cowboy &quot;, with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of scientists.
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, it is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was 63 years old.
The invention that bears his name is still alive and well.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” a common protein in many cancers and re-target them.
A trial of the vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory to make them &quot; see &quot; a common protein called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, as explained by Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West went on a rant in favour of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
The flight did not go well.
Kanye West was booed at Saturday Night Live after a rambling performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the message Make America Great Again, he began to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often get asked by white people how I can like Trump when he is racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have left the United States a long time ago.
SNL began the program with a sketch of Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee testimony regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the footage was not broadcast, Chris Rock posted the video of West's tirade on social media.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West said that he had been harassed backstage for wearing that hat.
They messed with me.
They told me not to go out with my hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I am dreaming, &quot; he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: 'I'm going to put my superman cape on, because that means nobody can tell me what to do. 'Do you want the world to move forward?'
Try with love.”
His comments were booed by the audience on at least two occasions and the members of SNL appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety, which reported that one person said: "The study was completely shut down."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West shocked many when he came out on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
I choose not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free to do so.
We also”, he added.
Before the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
This is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Lion, Prince, and many others have changed their names to a symbol and then to an artist.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear before the Magistrates Court in Belfast on Monday.
The tax office will check the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31 years old, has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that those screen roles often transmitted to young men that they had to be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that “something went wrong” and questioned how to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he thinks it &quot; quite important &quot; to address this issue.
I think it is very important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?
What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they now face?
Kit believes that television can have a part to play in the rise of toxic masculinity due to its male-dominated characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the street that makes young people feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any spin-offs or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "sick of battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his wife Rose is the best thing he got out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so in that sense it gave me my future family and my life from now on.
Rose represented Ygritte, the object of Kit, Jon Snow, &apos; s love in the series, which won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 % more new cases
China has announced an increase of 14 % in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820 000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Some 40 000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of these were infected through sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
HIV has traditionally been spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV through this route has been reduced to a very small number, as declared by Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100 000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGTB community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community faces much discrimination.
Because of the country &apos; s conservative values, studies have calculated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the infections are due to the failure to use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican senators and calls the allegations "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three United States Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about legislators.
The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles said the accusations were being pushed by commentators and websites on the "far right."
“Lies, damned lies and statistics”, said Waters in a tweet.
The information published included the addresses and phone numbers of the United States senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The filtering was done at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identified the origin of the postings was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not responsible for the leak of this information.
This allegation is completely unfounded and a complete lie.
Waters's declaration drew immediate criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer denied this information with anger.
This suggests that the necessary temperance for membership in Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not get angry.
Do not rebel.
The accuser's motives must not be questioned.
The person must remain calm and composed.
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of seeming too angry during his Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is challenging Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If that is true, it is very serious.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations.”
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against my staff.
Johnny English: Again in action. The Rowan Atkinson spoof is outdone
It has become a tradition to look for guinness in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what to do with this new Johnny English franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-parodying about how clearly ridiculous we are be the new opportunity for the nation to export?
Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and blank expression, has been given a licence to make a fool of himself for a second time.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that sort of thing that touched on the subject of Cars 2 at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It was originally based on the mysterious man traveller and international represented years ago by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television adverts, causing chaos in its wake.
There are two or three good moments in this last delivery.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter in full medieval armour while the rotors were smashing into the hull.
The humour is quite obvious, but it is rather superfluous and unnecessary, especially now that franchises such as 007 and Mission: Impossible are adding comic ingredients without any problems.
The humour seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and I find Johnny English's absurd mishaps not as clever and funny as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
The repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network, revealing the identities of all active agents to the consternation of the agent on duty, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
The first minister is a pompous and cornered figure, and her political popularity is sinking fast: Emma Thompson gives a good performance as this character, which is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for working with it.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That has to be the bumbling Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, although he also gives informal lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy school like James Bond.
English is summoned to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old pal Bough, represented once again by Ben Miller.
Bough is a married man with a submariner wife, a role he does not exploit enough with Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Service of Her Majesty return to action, with the beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
While the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous garrisons of a multimillionaire tech mogul who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; and English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR helmet to familiarise himself with the interior of the house of Volta.
The final sequence was definitely overdone, but the whole thing still has a rather childish feel to it.
A product that is quite common.
As with the other Johnny English films, I could not help wondering if the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan to make Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to think of a radical plan with which Britons would work four days a week, but would be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the owners of companies to allocate the savings made possible by AI to the workers, giving them an extra day off.
The employees would thus enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
The idea &quot; would fit &quot; into the party &apos; s plans and economic agenda.
This change to a four-day week has the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As one senior Labour Party figure commented to The Sunday Times: A review of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
The four-day week is definitely a matter for the future, but the party is working towards it as part of a general industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this type of idea, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, not all Labour MPs support this decision.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not part of the party's policy and will not be discussed at this stage."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to take back powers from "shadow directors" and "cronies" of public utilities.
One of the minister's shadow plans is to allow existing shareholders in water companies to recoup their entire stake, as a Labour government could make deductions to cover the irregularities.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10 % of shares in private sector companies would be allocated to employees, with dividends of up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice by at least a week and raises the question of whether the results could influence any Republican senator who might ultimately decide to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could produce information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
Of course, said Kennedy.
I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after all this had happened, after the allegation had come out, and I asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, determined.
Mr Graham's vote, however, seems to be immovable.
I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people she names has been able to confirm this.
It was 36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive roster of stars in support of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, the seventh edition of the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather at Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real objective: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively engaged in fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they can afford a VIP ticket), concert-goers have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other action that raises awareness of their goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of reaching its goal?
The idea of rewarding with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to take action or not; it is called "clicktivism," which is the position we take when we think we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or tweeting.
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in support of a wide range of objectives.
These actions have led to commitments and policies worth more than US$ 37 billion from world leaders, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guarantees have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
The Power of Nutrition is a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom with a shared commitment to "help children grow and reach their full potential." To that end, the partnership has proposed to provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda following more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
Thanks to the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens partners like you, we can make a small dent in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for "The Power of Nutrition," to a crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we believe can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
It will be a long and hard road and, in many cases, we will stumble and fall.
But, as they succeeded in the past in the movements for human rights and against apartheid, we shall succeed together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will have at the New York event this year, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of energy exports from Russia - Department of the Interior
In the event of a need, Washington could call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up the Middle East, as well as the entire world, according to US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the alliance with Russia with Syria, in particular where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is just a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are there in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier of last resort in Europe.
There are also official sources and methods of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to guarantee that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that the energy does not end up on the market.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as "the consumer voice in energy."
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and found that they are, in fact, the same.
The alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to make use of and replace fuels," he warned, "and Russia knows only one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to push its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to take the Russian option off the table for European consumers.
The Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, is trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted on the Nord Stream 2 project, which is worth $11 billion and is intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, being purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington &apos; s fierce opposition to the project is motivated only by economic considerations and is a further example of unfair competition.
I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The United States position has been met with a rejection by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry association BDI has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a major problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider running for president in 2020, she says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a visit to the Holyoke, Massachusetts, City Hall, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and to finally have women in leadership," he said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider standing for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a speech at City Hall and said he was "taking the country down the wrong path."
I am really concerned about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren spoke candidly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the election."
A majority of Warren voters, however, do not believe that he should run for re-election in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said that Senator Brown should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
A 32 per cent of the respondents supported his candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for 2020 of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a decision on it officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke of Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
The situation that my son is going through, because of everything that has happened since he returned, is known very well by the families that suffer the effects of the TEPT and other wounds that our soldiers return with, &quot; he said to the crowd that gathered in a rally in favour of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that nobody wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other veterans of war who "come home with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there is really that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a domestic violence complaint and possession of a firearm under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy to the new United States policy that denies asylum to domestic violence and gang victims.
Representatives from all 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a "friendly letter" to Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum-seeker who is facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" that was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against the federal policy has not been revealed.
He said that his "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but the US officials denied his request for asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The attorneys representing these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum claims to the United States, as nations that face widespread problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA, for its acronym in English) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in the United States.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, made statements on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to the Federal Asylum Act, all asylum applications must be decided on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application and this exception to the principle is in breach of that.
The lawyers also stated in their brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is bad for the US economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide a needed workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to domestic violence and gang violence victims in June.
The Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, announced this directive on 11 June.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, let alone all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to rescue in Palu as the death toll mounts in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly dire.
The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in a relief centre in the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulances arrive every minute with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their homes to search for whatever belongings they have left, in an effort to salvage what they can.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals, which were already overburdened, are now overwhelmed.
Some of the injured; including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continued strong tremors.
He could not help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he had been through while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We did not have time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the rubble, I think," Haris told Associated Press. "He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then there was a long silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope that is all right."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper by a Chinese official newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
The China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely read newspaper in Iowa, was mentioned by President Donald Trump on Wednesday, after he accused China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, something China denies vehemently.
The accusation that Beijing tried to influence the US elections marked a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led to increased tariff levels on both sides.
The Chinese retaliatory tariffs that were first applied to the United States in the early days of the trade war were designed to hit the states that supported the Republican Party of Donald Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is intensifying that pressure with advertisements in our free press."
In an attempt to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of free speech and press to try to place an advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
In contrast, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China can have on the worrying trajectory that the economy of their country is taking, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party.
One of China &apos; s most relevant newspapers had declined to publish the article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts say that the Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are rallying behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of numerous sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash could occur, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this have been very intense and many Republicans have said that they want to move forward with the vote.
In this type of matter, it is not possible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in an article published by The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the latest attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself as a supporter of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm disgruntled voters on this issue.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget tomorrow, or in November," said senior adviser and national spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre, of the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters outside the Senate chanted "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) as the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is off the charts," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, at the news site.
People say that the impact is already very significant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even higher, especially among indecisive women from the outskirts and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote, even though they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had warned that a confirmation vote could backfire.
This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as reported by NBC News earlier this week.
It is not just a question of the committee vote and the final vote, or even whether they sit on the bench with Kavanaugh; it is also how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who are on Kavanaugh's side.
In a new YouGov poll, 41 % of respondents said they believed Ford's testimony, while 35 % said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 % said they thought it was likely or certain that Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30 % said the same of Ford.
The FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when he was at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the legend of the technology. A company that is based on the open-source Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "to rule the world."
It has to be now," said the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid technology to allow users to create their own "online personal data store" or POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique to online data storage is that the user is in complete control of who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data."
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's chief executive officer, John Bruce, is to bring together resources, processes and skills to enable Solid to reach everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers on staff who were working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce a radical change where all their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
We are not going to ask for permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web site created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Even though Berners-Lee is launching Inrupt, he will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," he added.
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only English clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War was honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a marksman shot him four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren found a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered 100 years to the day after the battle that earned his grandfather the medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a dense fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and artillery."
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage," pushed the line forward to a single cannon and shot three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions his grandfather took were "so great that I will never be able to match them, but they were very inspiring."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "an honour for him to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is shown when he is given such a strong backing."
MMA fans stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 only to miss the main event.
The San José billboard had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was to be broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, the United Kingdom viewers were stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning to see the fight.
A Twitter user described the change to the cartoon as "a joke gone too far."
There is a government regulation that governs what is broadcast after 6 p.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when we asked him about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig", yes".
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they are going to modify the programme to include British viewers in the next editions.
When I think about the option of a live broadcast, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are looking into this.
When the programming was changed, we received a great deal of feedback, and not all of it was friendly.
We are trying to sort it out, because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not a problem of the government.
I can promise that the next time it will not happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is the usual number we have been doing. We tried to give more than usual to make the fans happy and we were successful.
This is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but that was what motivated him to become a success.
At 24, she told us that she did not realise until she got to secondary school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first episode of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that her intention in talking about gay rights was to "give hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to put less importance on winning at the Olympics.
The presenter of this legendary programme, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first Laverne, Daley, who was himself a marginalised child, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest of his peers because "society did not accept liking boys and girls".
He said: "Until today, that sense of inferiority and difference has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," so he did not disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent face of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games held in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he told his story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass on that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion declared that for him, too, it was a surprise to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year to an Oscar winner who is 20 years his senior, although he specified that the age difference had never been an issue.
When you live as long as I have, it is hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have been about 'having to win a gold medal'."
But there are more important things than gold medals.
My gold medal is, without doubt, Robbie."
His son is called Robert, after his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I was unable to tell him that I could not be in the first row.
He had his hand on my chest when he stopped breathing and it was only then that I realised that he was not invincible.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
I knew then that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to compete in the pool in front of my friends in the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This was also the inspiration for her first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied her in the run-up to the Olympics.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he is to avoid becoming a sad statistic.
Mickelson, who was playing in the event that is held every two years to break a record for 12 times, was beaten by Captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the centre of the action, as he has been so often for the United States, the five-time major champion had to be content with cheering on at some moments and, at others, trying to perfect his game in the field and thus be able to rectify what ails him.
The driver is not in the best of form, even at the height of his career, and the rough at Le Golf National is a constant source of trouble for him.
And if the field is not already daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth hole of Sunday's match, faces the brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points down after the first 12 individual matches, had started strongly, Mickelson's match could have been decisive.
Furyk trusted his companion, and he could say no more.
He understood perfectly the role he had to play today, patted me on the back and said he would be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams before and this week.
I did not imagine that I was playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that is how it turned out and that is how we thought it would be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break the record of Nick Faldo for the most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a long line of Ryder Cups that never equalled his individual brand of excellence.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, although Furyk said his presence added many more intangibles to the team.
He is fun, sarcastic, clever, likes to mock others; he is a great asset to have on the team.
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as a support this week; it was fun.
It adds much more than just play."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows only too well that, even with a substantial lead in the last few days of the Ryder Cup, he can easily turn into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 Ryder Cup at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to win by a margin of one point, 14½-13½.
You keep reminding me that we won a great tournament at Valderrama; we also won at Brookline and lost, we won at Valderrama and lost, but by a whisker," said Bjorn, pictured, after the 2018 generation won 5-3 on Friday and led by 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone else that this equipment is not yet finished.
You have to give it your all tomorrow.
Just go there and do what you have to do.
The points are not redeemed until the points are in the account.
We have a goal to achieve, and that is to win this trophy, and that is all we have to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where there are the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players had done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is now prevailing are individual actions and this is different.
It is great to share what is happening with a fellow golfer when things are going well, but when things are not going well, you are really tested.
The message to the players is to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now it is time to leave your partner behind and go and get the best out of yourself.
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be trying to get his players to play better individually than they did as a pair, with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas the exceptions, who added three points to four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the spectrum in recent major championships, being part of the winning team at Brookline and then losing when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
He remembered every word," he said when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-importants tomorrow, but we have to get off to a good start as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure is on those intermediaries.
We defined our strategy and made them feel like we were going to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the field.
I chose this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole route," Bjorn said about his individual choices.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate was to have been ordered in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era vessels, but will not be delivered until at least 2015 due to defective systems and escalating costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a statement by the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the handover of the ship delayed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that it will include a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and a few technologies of invisibility, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures that are very low.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, up to two years away from the home port.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to enable Germany to project its power into the far reaches of the world) will already be out of date when they start to operate, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to an outfitter after delivery.
The reasons for the return were not known, but German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the ship virtually unusable if sent to a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly serious, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors: half the number of personnel that had been on the old Bremen-class frigates.
The ship is also overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the whole project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is estimated that the amount has reached 3.1 billion euros (4.2 billion dollars), instead of the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that are being attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction in the German navy.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy was "running out of ships that can be deployed."
The problem has been getting worse over time, because the old ships have been decommissioned, but not replaced with new ones.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new research, carried out in a Scottish Highlands state, aims to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The information gathered will hopefully shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as the brown long-eared bat and Daubenton's bat of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in strategic locations on the property to track the activities of the bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using handheld detectors.
The experts will analyse the sounds picked up in the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the bats and what species make them.
A report and map of the habitat will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how they use them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affects their nesting and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and electric cables can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemicals in building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind,
Because of their nocturnal habits, their hearing is more useful than their eyesight in finding their prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocation to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who carry out regular surveys, inspections of nests and, on occasion, rescues.
The organization has also opened the first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
Here, at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats."
We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
However, there are still many things that are unknown about bats, and the work that we are doing here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance work on properties, as a colony of bats could be unintentionally destroyed and 400 females and young could be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species on which we do not know how their populations are evolving.
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations while his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labelled the rape allegations as "fake news," and says that people are "trying to get their name in the paper" at his expense.
His lawyers have been instructed to file a complaint with the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the statements.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping a woman from the United States, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of having been paid 375 000 $ to cover up the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already been viewed 142 million times hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, called the report "fake news."
No, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball, looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to make a name for themselves by mentioning me, but I can't help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," he added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations in what they call "an unacceptable intrusion into privacy," according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player &apos; s room and there, Ronaldo allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good boy" and that he had let him down by the "one per cent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "terrified of reprisals" and worried about "being humiliated in public."
The woman, who is 34 years old, is trying to cancel the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a big club in Italian football, for a fee of 100 million euros.
Brexit: the UK would regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.
He said it was "disconcerting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit could result in the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 per cent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production bottlenecks in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, general manager of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade; these include Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car industry are the problems that could arise in the event of a no-deal Brexit in the car industry.
The Toyota production line is based on the just-in-time (JIT) method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there could be a disruption at the border that, according to the sector, could cause delays and the shortage of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than one day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, which sets out the future relationship with the EU, is "tuned precisely to avoid these checks at the border."
We need an agreement. We need to get the best deal that will not only get us through this moment but will take advantage of the opportunity.
The evidence from Toyota and many other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a tremendously successful supply chain.
Toyota has not been able to say for how long it will be shut down, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the plant for 24 years and is Unite's site convener, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "From my experience, once those jobs are lost, they are never recovered."
A government spokesman said: "We have a clear and convincing plan in place for our future relations with the EU."
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, according to White House
The meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which was scheduled for Monday, could be postponed for another week, as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, links between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Expectations that Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thus compromise Mueller's independence have fuelled gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had taped his conversations with Trump with a microphone he was wearing to try to get rid of the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
However, on Monday he went to the White House, where it was reported that he was about to resign.
Instead, he announced a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testifying.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, the press secretary for Trump, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be another, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court."
We will decide on this as we go along and inform the press as we do.
Some journalists would dispute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the shortage of press coverage was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who acted with grandiloquence, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they do grandiloquence."
She suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President holds more question-and-answer sessions than any other President before him, and he cites these numbers without proof.
The press briefings will continue, he said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly the President of the United States, I think that is much better than asking me."
We have tried to do this many times and you have seen us do this many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
Indeed, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why that was so, where he made an unorthodox and sometimes bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish NHS Chief Executive writes to EU workers in the NHS Scotland about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working in the HSS of Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and its wish for them to continue with them post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of applications for EU citizenship for those working in public services that are not devolved to the Scottish Parliament.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit that was expected this autumn have continued.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know that this must be very confusing for you.
I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, to the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without doubt, your home and we would love to continue to have you as part of our team.
Christion Abercrombie is being operated on for a head wound.
Christion Abercrombie, a player on the Tennessee State Tigers, was taken to the hospital for emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday, when the Tigers lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tennesseean reported.
The Tennessee State trainer, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the injury occurred just before the break.
He came to the band and collapsed there and then.
Both trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie along the line before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operation.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury or damage" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with a total of 18 for the season.
Foreigners will be liable for a higher stamp duty when they purchase a property in the UK.
Foreigners will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to provide shelter for the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the land transaction tax will be payable by those who are not already paying tax in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year that will be spent on the homeless.
The extra money raised from the increase in stamp duty on foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May said today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralise the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his pledges to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to target those with higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp duty on property will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivise the government policy to tackle begging on the streets.
The levy, which is a supplement to the current stamp duty, including the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, could reach up to 3 %.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new-build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, which causes prices to rise and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's most expensive areas (especially the capital) have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping land prices artificially high by buying up land without any intention of building on it and urged Mrs. May to remove the "shameful" housing benefit cap to solve the "shameful" housing crisis in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, including rent controls and the end of no-fault evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more power to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: 'Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, should be able to buy houses more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of sleeping on the street is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to run Scotland"
The Sunderland coachman says his "primary objective" is to become Scotland's coachman at some point.
The Scot, 42, is excited about the prospect of reviving the club from the north-east, which currently occupies third place in the League One (the third tier of English football), three points behind the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only managed to get a B" hat", he told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father and it has always made me want to go back.
This opportunity will only become a reality if I manage to run a club successfully."
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no fear when he moved to such established names in a big club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, success for me is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
The structure and facilities of this club are certainly on a par with those of the Premier League," he said.
It is not easy to get, but I would consider myself successful only when I can return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after being an assistant at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the Hearts technical department.
He helped the Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and made St. Mirren go from being on the brink of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled that the Alloa was a "real crossroads" in his career.
I always thought that direction was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, but I was good at it, I could make a living from it and I enjoyed some great moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work; however, I feel well in the direction I am heading.
I have always wanted to train and now I have managed to do it, it is the time of my adult life in which I have felt better, without a doubt.
The interview can be heard in full on Sportsound on Monday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the best time to have a pint is at 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The heatwave of summer has boosted sales in British pubs that are struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
The sales of pubs and bars rose by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased their sales by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants have even fallen a little more.
The 1.8% fall in the restaurant trade in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their best month, compared to most restaurants, where they made the most profit.
Pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered from the heat, although not as badly as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to go out to drink.
Sales in bars and pubs rose by 6.6 per cent during the month, while sales of meals fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, the leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in sales in the market for leisure activities away from home.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared with last year will be especially painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering industry and time will tell whether the cooler temperatures of August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in branded openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, data is collected and analysed from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £900 million and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media sites, away from their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret accounts on social media sites that their parents and teachers are unaware of, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted among 20 000 secondary school pupils, revealed a growth in the number of fake Instagram pages.
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit content will be published.
20% of pupils have a "main" account that they show their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) have social media accounts that hide them from adults.
A survey of 20 000 secondary school pupils revealed the rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit content will be published.
About 20 per cent of the pupils said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents, while they also had other private accounts.
A mother who happened upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw an adolescent encouraging others to "rape" her.
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Federation board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on both track and field and the president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want to see sport benefit from his great experience over the past decade at international level.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish, UK and worldwide athletics community, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from her leadership.
Doyle said: "I like to be the mouthpiece for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics between the four golds he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischaemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or to what extent I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I have now fully recovered and am learning to walk again and doing exercises to regain my agility.
Thank you for your messages and words of encouragement!
The advertisement of the breast pump where mothers compare themselves to cows has divided opinion on the Internet.
A sacaleches company has divided opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To launch what in theory is the "world's first silent breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie posted an ad inspired by a video with a bit of irony showing mothers talking about the freedom they feel with the new breast pump.
Four women dance in a hay barn, with the words "Yes, I do it myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, these aren't udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Feed them, feed them, I am feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I am feeding my women."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has created a great deal of controversy.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it brings the "horrors" of the dairy sector to light.
A very unfortunate decision to put cows in the way of this product.
As with us, they have to be pregnant before they can produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after they have given birth," wrote one person.
The Elvie breastpump is discreetly attached to a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who do stay at home with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a ridiculous advertisement!"
However, other people defended the advertisement, including a woman who admitted that the song was “annoying.”
I think this is a great idea.
If it were still suckling, it would surely have one.
Using the pump, I felt like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit over the top, but I don't want to get into that.
It is a great product,” said one woman.
One person commented: "It is a funny advert aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The dairy sector is not praised or criticised in the advertisement.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who use a breast pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the breastpump, allowing users to move around, hold their babies and even go out into the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother partner and ECD, comments: &quot; The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minors discreetly relocated to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied minors detained has increased significantly, despite the fact that the monthly inflow at the border has remained at the usual levels.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be required to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at ICE, testified before Congress that ICE had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
Around 80% of sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
We are still pursuing these individuals,” said Albence.
In their eagerness to process juveniles more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum of one month from the time of arrest, as opposed to 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to the workers at the shelters.
Many will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for amparo will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the reports of the centres and the system, the longer the time spent in custody, the greater the likelihood of suffering from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Concerns are heightened in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that signs of distress by these children will be missed.
Furthermore, the transfer to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare emotionally and to say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma, which many are already suffering from.
Syria calls on the "occupation forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in his country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the matter would be dealt with accordingly.
They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism was practically over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people had died since 2011 and several million had been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any foreign illegal presence.”
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advice to the Syrian and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were in place for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "stoking irrational fears" that made them decide to stay outside the country.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns.
They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in Idlib, the last major rebel bastion, has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement has “clear time limits” and expressed the hope that the military action will focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), which will be “eliminated.”
Staffan de Mistura, un enviado especial de la ONU, espera convocar en breve las primeras reuniones de un nuevo comité compuesto por miembros del gobierno y de la oposición para redactar una constitución de posguerra para Siria y allanar el camino a unas elecciones.
Moualem set the conditions for Syrian participation in the committee, arguing that the panel should be restricted to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, he is impeached or disgraced prematurely.
This would be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!
There are no signs of fatigue among the audience.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC have doubled to 1.05 million and 1.6 million, respectively.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has surpassed the cable news channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for its top-rated nightly news programs.
Neal Baer, the creator of the ABC drama &quot; Designated Survivor &quot;, a series about a secretary of state who becomes president after a Capitol attack, says, &quot; It is an odd attraction that we still do not understand.
Writer Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club,” has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?
Scovell replied, &quot; Because it makes me laugh &quot;.
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information overload is such that you are left with the feeling that you have spent six hours listening to experts debating the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” the $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket of Paul Manafort (“an ostentatious display of wealth,” in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’s lurid descriptions of Trump’s anatomy.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
Offering something new every night is what makes it feel like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars,” when we talk about the alternating Trump and his daily plot twists (whether it be fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you want to keep up.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss last week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“Remember when we used to do all those crazy things and people said that was the end of Western civilization,” he says.
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows in the most adjusted mid-term elections of the Chamber of Representatives
It is no surprise that the money is flowing into the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a district in the Congress with two candidates seeking reelection to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure was recently redesigned, is represented by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another challenger for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding contest between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political experts have given the democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later reversed course.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Trump Organization evicted the Trump Organization team.
The State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of mission in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US aid 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the meetings progressed, the United States and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to stem emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, the high-level officials made it clear that their intention was to go ahead with the conference, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three Americans sent back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic returned safely to their countries without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of the special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also thought to be investigating the possibility that Trump's campaign was working in tandem with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that body, just as he is preparing to run for re-election, and perhaps ultimately to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs and buts, and I do not mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, or that his European equivalents are.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for Western powers to have stood up to him and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed to seize the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world revolves around these points of inflexion, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the news since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his inability to do the job.
Rosenstein says that The Times' explanation is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonesty?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will be in for a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury to Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans prevented him from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
We got a good result, because Villarreal is a good team.
We started the match believing we could get something and we ended up with nothing.
Perhaps we could have won the match, but the result was probably fair.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and were the better team.
We will have another great European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get all three points, but it will be a tough game because they did well in the previous match. But with the support of the public, I am sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be fine.
The equipment is in good condition, the boys are having a great time and we are getting a good workout.
I hope that we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.
The fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people spoke about this with their relatives.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the steps to have that conversation,” says Holly Snyder, Nationwide Life Insurance Company vice president.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options can be a factor in the cost.
Include your financial adviser in the conversion to your advisor, as he/she may also be able to help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Their options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover costs or self-insure with their own savings, as long as they have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: be prepared for legal battles.
Ensure that you have a power of attorney to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals follow your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
He can also prepare a notarial power of attorney for his finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father is having a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always at hand.
Not only the finances are at stake: 'What doctors do you have to see?' asks Martin.
What medicines is he taking?
Who will look after the dog?
It is necessary to plan everything.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the number expected to rise.
The communications blackout has prevented the assistance officers from obtaining any information from the regency of Donggala, a northern area of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The region, which is an administrative unit below the level of province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west coast of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
The following is a summary of some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 tsunami and earthquake.
This time, the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The Indonesian island of Lombok was hit by a series of major earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most on the island's northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin was booked into Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held without bond.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked to make a statement, the channel reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic assault complaint and possessing a firearm while intoxicated, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Several veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son &apos; s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communications networks have collapsed and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just to the side of the Sulawesi centre, which is in the north-east of Java, Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty only exceptionally for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out a bike lane attack on the West Side Highway in Manhattan last October, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
To justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" the eight victims and caused "serious bodily injury" "intentionally," in accordance with the notice of intent to seek a death sentence, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two officers face a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which is a charge often used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to the prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York has processed a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal execution in New York State was that of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This couple was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be flown in his hospital room, the police said.
He was acquitted of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are &quot; obviously disappointed &quot; with the decision by the prosecutor.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilty to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved.
Saipov's defence team had previously requested that the prosecutors not seek the death penalty.
Tory MP SAYS NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The UKIP leader Nigel Farage said that politicians should "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Nigel Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided ranks has been highlighted further by a group of Tories in favour of remaining in the EU joining a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers deal on track in the face of attacks from Brexiters, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force the Euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and 'chaos'.
Mr Bone said at Leave Means Leave's rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out of here by now.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: 'I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.'
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: "I say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public at large do not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: &quot; Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said to the Leave camp that they would have to "feel the heat" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
It is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
We are going to mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
While the favourable to the stayers made their way through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards reading "Tories Against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for the security problems they had with an application from the party during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be called a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will face off against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday was his thirty-sixth town hall meeting with voters using the town hall format since Trump took office.
A man was asked if he was planning to stand for the presidency.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes having a woman at the top.
A man was arrested for the murder of the LSU football player Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot and killed Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man in the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot dead near the campus of the Southern University at first light on Friday.
Wayde Sims was shot in the head and ultimately succumbed to his injuries, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and booked into East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98m player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
RUSSIAN GRAND PRIX: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the moment that Valtteri Bottas took the lead from Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the orders from Mercedes would play a big part in the race.
From the pit, Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of the picture by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting his team-mate to attack him.
Vettel was the first to go into the boxes and let Hamilton run in the slipstream, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out with a strong push and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a move with wheels almost touching that made the Ferrari driver give up the inside line at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished seventh in the first race.
He led a large part of the race while clinging to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
He finally got into boxes on lap 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to recover from Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman in letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job of finding a perfect match” said Hamilton.
That was a really bad sign of disrespect.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were people who were "bad, repugnant and false."
The only thing that could happen and is good about what is happening in the Senate these days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false.
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say “But I didn't do it.
I did not do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember to filter the document... - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not filter it out.”
Well, give me a minute.
We have not filtered it, we have not filtered it,” he said while imitating the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I did so.
But the president's refusal did not go down well with him, as he commented during his Saturday night speech: "I will tell you one thing: that was really bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.
Continuing with his defence of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they do not care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get the power and control,” said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the damage by beating the Belfast Giants 5-3 in the Elite League on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie earned the local split before Dwyer restored the Giants lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third defeat in a row for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast the previous Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
The first goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what was a very lively opening period, Sullivan returned the local team to the fray in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt came on to level the scores in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took advantage of the break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalised the score with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Dundee to give them the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and they secured the victory with the fifth goal of their team in the closing stages.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
A traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane from the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying in the process of ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to shake the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu control tower, which was being buffeted by strong winds.
The captain of the aircraft, who was in the cockpit, insisted on waiting for the Batik Air flight 6321 to take off safely.
The pilot jumped from the control tower when he thought the tower was about to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
The decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait, who was quoted by the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
Our hearts break when we hear this.
While the authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, the national disaster mitigation agency says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of victims is expected to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people have not been contacted.
Tsunamis up to six metres high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: &quot; Every minute an ambulance comes with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being plundered everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible to the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.
President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the Indonesian army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN asked.
Indonesia had been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in early 2018, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that a man has gone missing after the Air Niugini plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the sinking aircraft safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening, a male passenger had been unaccounted for.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The aircraft and the United States Navy said that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the aircraft had overshot the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane came in very low.
That is extremely good news, said Jaynes.
Jaynes and other passengers managed to swim through water up to their waists to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
The flight attendants were in a panic and were screaming, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that the sailors who were working on a nearby pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the PNG Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in PNG over the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its arguments in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the mobile phone records to track the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone records showed that Chambers had been using Sanford's phone during the time he said he was with Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford &apos; s truck that night, Sanford said he was &quot; lying, because my truck was in Nashville &quot;.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records showed that they were known only a week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers &apos; death, Tellis deleted Chambers &apos; messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale wiped her from his life.
The defence is due to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be in the hands of the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip hop moved away from its roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Acts like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny demands a couple to be fired after a text "racist"
A New York nanny is suing a couple for wrongful termination after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple deny being racist and compare the demand with a case of “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was shocked to discover that the new childminder, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON”, she wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After making his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired his former nanny, who was African-American, and hired a Filipino woman instead, according to the New York Post.
Mauritius received the pay for one day of work and sent it home via Uber.
Mauritius is now suing the couple for a compensation of $350 per day for the position of six months of work for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them that things are not done that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it is a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that the termination of Maurice &apos; s employment was the most reasonable course of action, as they feared that they could not trust her after she had offended them.
My wife had sent him something he did not want to see.
She is not racist.
We are not racist,” said Joel Plasco to Post.
“Would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have been rude to, even if it was an accident?
To your newborn?
¡Come on!”
Comparing the demand as “extortion,” Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to go with someone like that?
That is not a very decent thing to do,” the investment banker added.
Although the case is still pending, the public opinion has already denounced the couple on social media, criticising their behaviour and their logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers might not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new card
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the map: &quot; It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before publication.
It is good to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera man before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the children's book, had hoped his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "a bit bittersweet" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very quiet man and did not like to boast.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, though it was not really your achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although he was the creator and product of his own imagination, he always gave credit to the original Paddington Bear.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
On landing, she was immediately transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said that he called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to succeed.
I received a call from Nad to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did just that.
I said to him: "Tashi, I love you so much, darling."
I will be there soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were running out and his system was failing.
She had died prematurely and everything was going dark.
I was able to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not scream, shout or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand my ground.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was about to go through.
No one knew.
I bent my head and the tears kept falling.
It is difficult to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much she wanted him.”
Widows wear cards to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
He was known to everyone by his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any place.
However, he left his job before dying, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly concerned that it could have an impact."
Davis created the cards &quot; so people know there are people to talk to and people to talk to, even if it is a friend.
You have to talk about it, you have to speak out.
Ms. Humphreys, who is a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
He did not say he was depressed or anything like that.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.
He said that his death was a great shock to them, but they have to get over it: &quot; It leaves a big hole in the family.
We are devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
Mr. Flake said on Saturday that he thought that if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited investigation, of limited scope), then maybe we could bring a little unity to it, and he feared that the committee was &quot; going off the rails &quot; in the midst of a partisan standstill.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican allies not want the FBI investigation to proceed?
The refusal is due entirely to the timing.
There are only five weeks to go until the mid-term elections, and if the Republicans do badly, their attempts to get the man they want for the Supreme Court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife, Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The figures for North Korean deserters “fall” with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that 1,127 deserters were reported last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by people smugglers, had been the key factors.
No public comments have been made by Pyongyang on this issue.
Most of the deserters from the north are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most defectors flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified DMZ between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and, frequently, they are repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the historic June summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
Without the trust of the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House of Representatives, said that the nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was a "hysteric" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
I can't help but think if a woman had acted that way, they would have called her hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used the emotion of the moment to deny the allegations of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking up while talking about his family and his years of high school.
In the committee, he also condemned explicitly the Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated slanders" organized by disgruntled liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her view, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and the Democrats took control of the House.
I will say one thing: if he is not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he is not fit to be on the court he is on now.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, which is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
This is not the time for an hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine.
Women have to carry it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury, and she cannot let go without crying.
We cry when we are angry, as Ms. Steinem said 45 years ago.
I don't think that is so unusual, is it?
He continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was speaking: "Perhaps you think I am crying because I am sad."
No, I am not angry.”
And then he went back to what he was doing.
I thought that was great.
Tears are permitted as a way out for rage in part because they are not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once finding myself in tears with an inexpiable rage. A senior woman manager, a serious person with whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the collar and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
They have no idea that you are furious.
They think you are sad and will be glad because they think they have trapped you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business, which forced her to withdraw from the presidential race, she had a brainstorm that there was no reason why she should not run for president herself.
It was not a well-considered decision, he said with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they did not need another one.
Someone called us Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.”
As the campaign was already well under way, he was left behind in the fundraising, and promised that he would not enter the race unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost cause.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, gave him only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?”, he asked.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on capturing voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown, said Schroeder, recalling the reaction of the press.
You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was thinking that they would put something on my tombstone.
The word &quot; &quot; cried &quot; &quot; is missing.
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning in early 2018 when he imposed tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The escalation this week was with new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, which will add taxes to half of the goods that come into the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has retaliated with equivalent tariffs, applying 5-10 per cent duties on $60 billion worth of American products.
China has pledged to match the US attacks, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will back down soon.
To back down to Washington would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a rapid policy decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a crash landing in either country is in fact far more dangerous than has been recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, associate fellow at the Center for New American Security, who focuses on Asia.
Syria is ready to receive the refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and to seek help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has now lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country were improving.
The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave it because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept any conditional aid or aid from the countries that had promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup of 2018, defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive matches on European soil since its last Ryder Cup victory in Europe in 1993.
Europe reclaimed the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn managed to get the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, launched his ball into the water on the 16th hole, admitting defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to have ever recorded a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 against the lowest-ranked player in the European team, the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world number one, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio García, a veteran who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European player with the most wins in the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It has been a very hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have won the cup.
It is a team effort and I am very proud to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now it is the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a match play event.
I feel an incredible sense of pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, as I grew up watching him play.
Woods lost four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is an extraordinary statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf all weekend.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we were able to warm up the situation in Europe.
But we spoil it.
I would like to congratulate Mr Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Their 12 players have done a very good job.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
We must bow our heads.
We have been outdone.”
Update of the red tide: Decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, irregular bloom conditions are being reported in areas of the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting a reduction in concentrations.
The bloom of red tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from Pinellas County to Lee County.
There are some scattered parcels as far as 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
Red tides have also been detected in Pasco County.
During the past week, medium concentrations have been reported in Pinellas County and on its coast, medium concentrations between low and high on the coast of Hillsborough County, medium to high concentrations on the bottom in Manatee County, medium to high concentrations on the bottom in Sarasota County and its coast, medium to high concentrations on the bottom in Charlotte County, medium to high concentrations on the bottom in Lee County and on its coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwest corner of Florida during the past week.
