Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM, for Assembly Members in English) are concerned that they will appear "muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for its English initials).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Member of Parliament said that his party was concerned that "it would be left with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: Twp means "idiot" and pwp means "shit".
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that his group was "disappointed" and had suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member in Wales said his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the jump from Muppet to Muppet was "small".
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of Assembly Members will be a matter for the Assembly Members themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed strong support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of Parliament, the Committee preferred Members of Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the option MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
It appears that the Assembly Members are suggesting alternative options, but the fight to reach consensus could bring the Assembly President, Elin Jones, to a head, as she would have to send the bill on the changes through in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members and the design of the committee system.
The Assembly Members will have the final say on how the names should be called when the legislation is being debated.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will decide on Sunday whether their country will be called "Republic of Macedonia North".
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that its northern neighbour's name implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in Harlem
“Historically, the people I have spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
Today, there is neither one nor the other.
It was understandable that bars were disappearing.
“People socialize in a different way now,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods that people visit regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "in the end, they will return to the starting point".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks full of people who would not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore they will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.”
Two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation disappeared in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped in the building acquired it.
A black congregation took over the reins of St. Martin's, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were resisting hiring or promoting blacks.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while Father Johnson &apos; s congregation was planning for its reconstruction, they also ordered the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly called them "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who played the drum called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan noted that it was the first snare drum ever used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who played it at Riverside Church, a larger drum, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the church's lay leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the parish governing body, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was attempting to pass the costs to the parish council, although it had not been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiger shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for abalone in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the opening day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child calling for help, so he swam over with a group to rescue him.
Hammel said he initially thought he was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then realized he was "screaming that he had been bitten."
He had a broken collarbone, Hammel said as he reached the child.
Hammel said: "I told everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark."
The child was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain, Larry Giles, said in a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had upper torso injuries.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there were more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff in their beauty and style departments.
In order to significantly boost the beauty market in the United Kingdom, valued at £28 billion and growing at a rate faster than the decline in fashion and homewares sales, the largest beauty halls will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space that used to be reserved for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with similar areas to those of other stores, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range, with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift towards buying smaller amounts of food daily from local shops are forcing supermarkets to work harder to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that the stores would become more like shopping centres as the supermarket chain tried to combat discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and introduced Habitat stores since it bought the chains two years ago. It is believed that this has driven food sales and made the acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the chain of supermarkets to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a disagreement over how to divide the profits from the drugstore sales in its supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of 281 Sainsbury's pharmaceutical outlets to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will be participating in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers."
We have also invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to meet all needs. On the other hand, an attractive and convenient location makes us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million deal
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones was "furious" after Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the latest fashion and accessories at Truly.
This business had been compared to Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the girl of gold on television admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for her Truly fashion and accessories business.
The business had been compared to Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune of around £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Holly truly made this her number one priority."
It was to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
Their decision to withdraw left everyone involved completely stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a full warehouse of goods at Marlow HQ, ready to go on sale.
Experts believe the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly delay the launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby established Truly in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as president in March.
The couple were on holiday together and Jones had a 40 % stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become the face of Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night "we didn't talk about business".
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his mock-newsman voice.
He has not given up.
He said Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had praised the first meeting held in Singapore in June as a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country had not seen an "appropriate response" from the United States to its first steps towards denuclearization of North Korea.
In contrast, he said, the United States was still applying sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump's speech at his rally was much more optimistic than the speech he gave at his rally.
He said: "We get on great with North Korea."
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
We now have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, help in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
It is very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we would have 200 right here,” Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was reported to foreign NGOs that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for triggering international assistance.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a little,” Mrs Sumbung explains.
Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, but they are still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, said that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations could provide assistance.
Given that Indonesia is a country where the land is constantly moving, it is incredible that the country is so ill-prepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami sirens in Palu, even though there was a warning, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, travelling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake was heading for Palu, but would take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who is facing re-election next year.
It must also contend with the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, scores against Chelsea
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge saved a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri from just over 27 metres out from Chelsea's goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot before kicking it off the second tee.
The action sent him over the top of the net and towards the right-hand corner of the net.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
“I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very early, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kant coming and gave him a nudge. I didn't think too much about it, I just fired the shot.
Chelsea were winning 1-0 at half-time after Eden Hazard had scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' right-back made a tackle on Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning and making a run into the Liverpool half and entering the field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle of the field.
After that, Hazard made a nice pass to the area that took him to the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished with a left-footed shot from the edge of the area that Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not stop.
Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool plays Napoli in the Champions League group stage. The match will be played at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami that followed in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency at first light on Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six metres, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, during a press briefing.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder of a woman after she was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews, in John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, Birkenhead, and who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
I would also recommend any person, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the body found is that of a woman from Birkenhead and was found on the inside of a property.
Some people who believed they knew the woman came to the crime scene this afternoon to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was left stunned when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now being told that they will be allowed back in within a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
He keeps repeating "it is terrible".
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents were standing guard inside the cordon controlling the building.
Any person with information is asked to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, registration number 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament Square becomes the last commemorative success by "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects and artefacts in England carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestions as "madness" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the removal of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the Cromwell of the wrong century will be sacrificed by the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft Cromwell is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century and to part of the history of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many now see Cromwell, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, the monarchy."
If it is a completely accurate description, then the debate is a matter of history.
What is true is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has given shape to the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a livestock dealer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery severed and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pen in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood on its mouth in the pigsty.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig had attacked the farmer until his death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and broken”, said the cousin, who is known by his surname, Wu, to The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera images showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It appears that the family of Yuan and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, it is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it away.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "disparator."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What is needed is to treat them with the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rains in the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is expected to bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa caused gustos de viento de más de 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday morning (5 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) to Monday morning (5 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time), and was located about 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low-pressure systems are starting to develop in the Pacific Ocean, which are moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States.
Rosa is expected to leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain hits the low pressure system that is approaching, widespread heavy rain will occur across the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause sudden flash floods, debris flows and possible sand slides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause flash floods of 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 10 centimetres is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain, flash floods can occur suddenly with conditions that rapidly worsen.
Due to the threat of torrential tropical rains, it is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the rivers into raging torrents and storms could cause local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching low pressure system will bring heavy rains to specific parts of the southern California coast.
Heavy rains could leave as much as two centimetres of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
It would be the first heavy rains of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before becoming widespread by late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, the United States will see some intense temperature changes as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
Sometimes, this can mean drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of this will be seen across the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long, hot summer will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures generally in the mid-20s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term outlook indicates above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s appearance
More than 20 million people followed the wrenching testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, politics continued to grind to a halt and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest developments from Friday: a deal crafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 per cent certain that Kavanaugh had groped her while she was drunk at a high school party and had tried to take off her clothes.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely certain that that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who Nielsen mentioned on Friday have seen it.
The company calculated the average audience for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels that carried it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems calculating how many people see something in the office.
For perspective, it is like a playoff or Oscar night.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led the cable leader with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers for a hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Following the appearance, there was a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the morning of Friday, CNN and CBS cameras captured protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
While receiving these criticisms, which were being broadcast live on CNN, he appeared dejected.
One woman said, &quot;Looking me in the face,&quot; and another said, &quot;I am not going to be intimidated by this.&quot;
"Are you telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Flake said his office had issued a press release and, before the elevator doors closed, he would have more to say to the Committee.
Cable and broadcast television were all live-streaming it hours later, when the Senate Judiciary Committee had to vote to nominate Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was critical, as it became clear that Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of "politicising" Brexit
Theresa May, the Prime Minister, accused her critics of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham (United Kingdom) on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to share customs duties was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde murder: Simpson arrested as suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Police released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 bond has been set, according to the defense.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police in the area for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "in shock" by the death of Wayde Simpkins on Friday morning.
Wade said: "These are the things that people always worry about."
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
Ash from Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre registered several tremors and shakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after clashes between Catalan independence protesters and riot police during a demonstration coinciding with the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists who had been blocked by the riot police hurled eggs and powder at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally full of tourists.
There were also confrontations later in the evening and the police used batons to quell the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans such as "No amnesia, no forgiveness", faced off with unionists shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, as those opposed to secession boycotted the referendum in large numbers.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a show of support for the National Police.
The march continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would ever become independent.
Last year was one of our best years.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite a narrow victory in regional elections last December, the pro-autonomy parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
He said: "It is getting more and more tense."
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would stand for the European Parliament elections next year.
Running for the European elections was the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government.
Londonderry: men arrested for driving into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday evening at around 19:30 on Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that there had been damage to the access and the building itself.
At some point, it is possible that the car was shot at with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
A Livingston promoted to impress Rangers with his second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference. Gary Holt's men went up a place, with Hibs in second.
This season, Gerrard have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table by eight points.
Before that, Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its winning streak to six games in the division.
Livingston lets a big hitter go
The Holt team should have been a step ahead much earlier, causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence but failed to score from in front of the goal. Alan Lithgow then missed the target after a Craig Halkett centre had been deflected into the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-stopping play.
Thus the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston tried to score with a combined effort from Declan Gallagher and Robinson, which hit the ball and went in from the centre of the area.
At that time, Rangers were in control of the possession, but were unable to pass the defence of the host and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, who was quite relaxed.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stoppage.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked a Scott Pittman shot with his foot, and Livingston was unable to get another shot off against Lithgow.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly being entered, but they were always cleared out. Two penalty claims were rejected, one after Glenn Middleton had replaced Halkett and the other after a handball.
Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous view is that they played a great game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His style of play and his squad have hardly changed since his rise, but this is largely down to Holt, who has strengthened the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good moments with Gerrard, they came up short.
They failed to materialize their plays, as they only managed to penetrate the opposition's field once, which is a call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received a mixed welcome in Cologne
Smiles and a blue sky greeted the leaders of Turkey and Germany at breakfast in Berlin on Saturday.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership of the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons for preventing 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers turned up in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan also spoke out, including many Kurds, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Accident on Deptford High Street: cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road to the east of the city, at 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by the paramedics, but died there and then.
The accident occurred after a cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in disturbances
Six prison officers have been injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the Directorate of the Penitentiary.
The disturbances began at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 9:30 on Sunday and are still continuing.
A team of elite specialists (known as "Tornado") is handling the disturbances, which involve eight inmates and affect a pavilion.
The agents received assistance for facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specialist staff from prisons have been deployed to deal with the incident at Long Lartin prison."
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.
Long Lartin prison, which holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner had attacked him.
In October last year, prison guards were requested to come to the prison to deal with a serious incident in which balls of pool were thrown at the prison staff.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid regions could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued flood warnings for the western Arizona, southern Nevada and eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving behind showers on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of torrential rain, which can reach 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be between 2 and 5 cm, with the possibility of reaching 10 cm in isolated areas, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flash floods, Rosa &apos; s rains are considered a blessing, as the region is suffering from drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that some of these torrential rains will be beneficial due to the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering from extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will batter the Baja California peninsula.
Hurricane Rosa, which is still a powerful hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 mph (219 km/h), is 619 nm (1,100 km) south-southeast of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moving northward at 19 kt (36 km/h).
The storm is running into cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to arrive in Mexico City with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon on Monday.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at risk of flooding.
“Heavy rains of between 7 and 15 inches are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 inches,” as reported on weather.com.
After that, Rosa will head north towards Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression.
The main danger to Rosa or its remains is the torrential downpours in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest United States.
Heavy rains are expected to cause sudden flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Four arrests for attempted murder in Midsomer Norton
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
Three 17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area of Somerset that same night, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
The agents have made a call for anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and the anger of the Democratic Party"
Trump said voting for Kavanaugh was a vote to reject the "shameful and disgusting tactics" of the Democratic Party.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the meanness and the anger of the Democratic Party throughout the entire nomination process."
Kavanaugh testified before the Senate on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, "Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our day, a lawyer with an impeccable record of service to the public,” he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to the Kavanaugh nomination in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not running, but I am in the race,” he said.
That is why I go from one place to another fighting for big candidates.
Trump claimed that Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
A senior Republican official told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of a quake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that have been ravaging the beaches since a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday night when waves of up to six metres high arrived in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When it was announced yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, by its Indonesian acronym) in a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, and everything on land,” said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved at a speed of 800 km/h across the open sea before reaching the coast.
He also said that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The shelling of the coastal city continued on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in a region with 2.4 million people.
The BPPT, in a statement, said the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300-km stretch of coastline north of Palu, known as Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
“More than 300,000 people live there”, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
That is a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse, he said.
On Saturday, the agency came under fire for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard warning people in the street below that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in the surrounding area of Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened only for emergency and rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
It is very bad.
Although the staff of World Vision in Donggala had arrived safely in Palu, where they were sheltering under tarpaulins erected in the garden of their offices, they had seen a devastating scene on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
He said he had been told that many houses had been destroyed.
It is very bad.
While the disaster relief gears were being put into motion, some people were complaining that the movement of experienced relief workers to Palu was being prevented.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign funding, supplies and personnel can be used in a disaster area if it has been declared a national disaster zone.
And that has not happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the Government says it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international assistance, but it has not happened yet.
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people still missing still had hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolate stories that natural disasters write.
A small child was rescued from a manhole on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, national team parapente coach for Indonesia, had trained two of the missing parapenters for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the students trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
He said: "I have my own emotional baggage from my experience in the field of paragliding."
Mr Gendon recalled how, following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the community of parapenters, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors at Palu, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a grey verification mark, not two blue ones.
He said: "I think that means the messages were not delivered."
Thieves steal $26,750 from an automated teller machine at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a Brink employee was robbed of $26,750 by thieves who approached him while he was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied an ATM machine located in the entertainment area and was preparing to reload it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money intended for recharging.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the area, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Any person with information about the identities of these individuals should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will now be known as Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time now, and he used that name as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons", as the creator of the show commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name, West had previously said that the word had religious significance for him.
“I think it is the most used word in the Bible, which means ‘you’,” West said in January while discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
It means "I am you, you are me, we are one."
He went from being Kanye, which means "the only one", to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population again, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
President López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing them with monthly stipends for those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements by several parts of the U.S. Government, even though, in general, the United States lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number one innovator in I A. by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the United States,” says Lee.
The doubling of funding means twice the chance of the next great achievement in I. A. being achieved in the U.S., as Lee declared in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed a system of I.A. that defeated the best American player of Othello. He subsequently became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
He noted the previous technological competitions of the United States Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, investigators often have to work hard to get Government funding, Lee said.
Lee said: "It is not China that is taking the leaders; it is the corporations."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent university professors to work on I. A.
Lee said that changes in U.S. immigration policy could also help intensify U.S. efforts in I.A.
I think that doctors in I. A. should be given permanent residency cards automatically, he said.
China's State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions as well as from government agencies such as the National Science Foundation in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In early 2001, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic sectors. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Intelligence in Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research on I. A.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation that sought to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change their country's name.
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of Macedonia of the North", a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the required minimum 50 per cent turnout will be achieved.
The referendum ballot question was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to help Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
“I have come here today to vote for the future of my country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopie.
Although it will not be legally binding, many members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote so that it will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared at 1 p.m. that no irregularities had been reported.
However, voter turnout was only 16 % compared to 34 % in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I am here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in Skopie.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on changing the name of Macedonia in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and removing chairs from the tents of those who were boycotting the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door,” said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we do not want to enter Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
The Prime Minister Zaev says that joining NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, whose unemployment rate is over 20 per cent.
I believe that the majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required turnout.
A poll conducted by Telma TV, in Macedonia, revealed that 57 per cent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policies of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, evades the entire Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score in the 65th minute.
Argentina's mediapunta received a free kick in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking into open country.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded a defender before outrunning several more in the Brighton area.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
England forward Michael Owen used his first touch to return the ball to Agüero, who hit it with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot that hit the right post.
City manager Pep Guardiola said Aguero had some problems with his foot.
We are talking about 55 to 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky to score at that moment.
However, it was Manchester City who gave Manchester United the early advantage in the Premier League title race.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton territory.
He made a lovely ball to the left side for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave Sterling a few taps before sending him to the second tee.
The Sky Blues forward launched the ball into the net just before going offside.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies' party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, always competitive Scherzer is hoping to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who are in first place in the National League West, still have playoff chances.
The Rockies at least secured a wildcard berth with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still chasing their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that Denver's crowd will be energized and that the other team will likely play at the highest level I have faced this year.
Why wouldn't he want to participate?
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it seems they are leaning towards letting Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th opening, had a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest day on Sunday.
Washington's record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 games.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation, his selection for the Supreme Court, when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
In November, everything we have done is at stake.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is one of the most important. I am not running, but I am fighting for great candidates, so I go from one place to another.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of democrats, they are passing through now."
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, and the meanness, the wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control. And we are not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, were embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
“We have seen it these last four days,” he said, saying that Democrats were “angry, bad, horrible and false.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, &quot; What? &quot;
No, no mmm, I hope for a response. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.
The Labour Party has a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think
When the activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour Party Members of Parliament who are told that we are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment for being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He was at odds with the importance of a responsible economic policy in terms of national security for Europe. It is ironic that he was at odds with leaders on issues on which he had previously disagreed.
As stated in the notice of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years that I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more friendly and compassionate" policy is already forgotten, if it ever really applied.
It is becoming clearer that Labour Party views are not tolerated and that each view is judged in terms of whether the party leadership considers it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision began to expect him to change his mind radically and adopt positions with which he had never been comfortable, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the centre policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced this.
Indeed, I am fortunate in that my comments tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist abuse, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every censure motion or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
Over the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice to keep my head down and not make too much noise, so that I would be "all right".
But I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student at the age of 16, I have been motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my school in ruins, to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a Minister in government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, and I certainly did not do so in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions or areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday that I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Momentum Nottingham, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will stop me from acting in the way I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an unbeaten Ayr tops the table
Two late goals may have decided the final outcome, but without doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Premiership match.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten that are participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make better use of opportunities, that gave the local team the victory, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
“We have been tested in all the games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: "Ayr deserves the recognition, they took the opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute conversion by Frazier Climo put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, on loan to Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the opponent's disadvantage and Jason Baggot converted a penalty kick.
Ayr extended its lead with a penalty kick. Just before halftime, he scored and converted a penalty kick, leaving the score at 17-5 in favour of Ayr at halftime.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's converted try by Baggot reduced the deficit to five points.
After a lengthy stoppage for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, and the game restarted, Ayr went ahead with a Stafford McDowall try converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the fact that they had one more man with a non-converted Bruce Colvine at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the locals recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for placating Climo without the ball from the penalty spot, MacPherson made a try from the back of the maul as it was advancing.
The weather converted him, as it had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry flying to the bottom of the wing for the fifth shot at goal.
The star of Still Game wants to steer his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restaurant business after it was revealed that he had been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor Jack Jarvis, 56, is best known for his role as the hapless Mr. Wainwright in the BBC sitcom &quot;The Likely Lads&quot;, which he wrote and co-starred in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming Glasgow restoration market".
“The sea is ours”: a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the Pacific route
Naval personnel are based at a naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags wave in public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea is ours by right."
It is a duty to recover it.”
In all of Bolivia, a land without a coast, the lost coast is still remembered vividly, as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is expecting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and calm, and is waiting for the results with a positive vision, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens set up throughout the country, hoping that the International Court of Justice in The Hague will rule in Bolivia's favour, that after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is locked in a controversial battle over re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution adopted on Monday.
He said in August that they were "very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favour and that the situation would not change much if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice issued its ruling only six months after the final submissions indicated that the case was "not complicated", said Chilean expert Paz Zárate.
Far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have hampered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
He also suggested that Morales' bellicose rhetoric had undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talking, but it will be extremely difficult to keep talking after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia &apos; s representative to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court &apos; s decision-making process was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and to end 139 years of mutual benefit disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The resolution is an opportunity to see what we need to leave behind.
North Korea says it will not give up its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never be the first to give up nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made at a summit meeting in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come as Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy talks that have been stalled for more than three months since the summit with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.
He said that the continuation of the sanctions and the United States &apos; opposition to a declaration that would end the Korean War and bring North Korea to heel was a &quot; fantasy&quot;.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang making a significant disarmament move first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness in giving up its arsenal, which it probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is expected to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The latest Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of enormous hats about to land in a street near you
If you want to add to your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large items included pineapples with jewels, a witch's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of outrageous masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-on lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One sculpture depicted a complete scuba diving team, including a mask and snorkel, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you are in luck.
The hat-hunters predict that the huge hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
Big hats are coming in strong with "La Bomba" - a 60-centimetre-wide straw hat worn by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The hat, which became a social media sensation, was followed by another great creation on the runway: a beach bag as big as the one the model was carrying.
The Jacquemus orange-brown raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets of the high street. Since the designer has had such an impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: linguistic competence is fundamental for citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the exams that is reinforced by individual and collective success in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for its English initials), are striving to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools have as their aim to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they will occupy as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a modern curriculum, it is observed that modern languages are still popular and desired in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, &quot;If you talk to a man in his own language, you reach his heart.&quot;
If you speak to them in their language, it reaches their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if one wants to establish relations and build trust with people from other countries, English alone is not enough.
If we look at the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
Overall, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received an A, the highest grade.
Data from the 74 centres that make up the SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent Scottish schools support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that children and young people will need for sure in the future.
Languages are currently considered to be on a par with the sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects in the curriculum of independent schools and everywhere else.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17 per cent of employers cited language skills as a barrier to filling vacancies.
Therefore, linguistic skills are becoming increasingly essential for preparing young people for their future careers.
The increasing demand for language skills in the workplace means that these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter which race someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to this kind of competition, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will give that person an automatic head start on the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation.
For this reason, investing in language education is important for today's children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be better equipped to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on modern classic languages, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools he or she will always be able to choose between several languages taught by specialist teachers in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital role to play in the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages are "competencies for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James makes his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for Los Angeles Lakers fans hoping to see LeBron James make his debut with the team is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the season opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the length of the game is still to be determined.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
In this stage of his career, he said, he did not need pre-season parties to prepare.
Time of Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump campaign events scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
It can be viewed online via a live YouTube feed.
It is likely that Trump will comment on this week's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been dogged by sexual misconduct allegations and has left the Senate waiting for a vote on his confirmation for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main aim of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans facing November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, the Trump campaign said that the five rallies next week are intended to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House," according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that Trump will travel to as many states as possible while campaigning, a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, but declined to give his name.
The rally tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage in Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is falling behind in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has to come and push him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the United States team shows that it is willing to fight to keep the hope of individual matches alive on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept in sport, but players believe in it even more in competitions like this.
So where is the impetus now?
“We were six points behind and now we are four points behind, so I guess that is a little bit of a boost,” said Jordan Spieth after the round.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points ahead with 12 more on the line.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have a bit of wind behind them and plenty of reasons to be optimistic, among other reasons because of the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and earned four points together.
Spieth has been lethal off the tee and preaches with example.
The guttural roars of celebration grew louder as the round progressed, introducing a vital putt for Thomas and him to tie the fourth round when they were two down after two holes.
The putt that the Americans gave them in the 15th was greeted with a similar cry, one that said that the Americans had not yet been knocked out.
What is needed is to redouble efforts and focus on the party, said Spieth.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable couple of Europe have won four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only pair to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That run and the way it flows with the noisy crowd of spectators on Sunday leave no doubt that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, on two different holes.
However, it is still premature to talk of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio García, the hero of the four-ball morning, after teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help to get out of the holes on Sunday.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch because you see the interplay between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team was willing to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leads by a good margin on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after the fourballs and foursomes had finished with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two wins over a Tiger Woods who was in trouble, taking four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a US team that made many errors in the morning foursomes, which ended 3-1.
The United States fought back in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership helped them to beat a dejected Woods and the American rookie Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who had not shone too brightly in the two matches on Saturday, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned with Henrik Stenson to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and three players respectively, 2-1.
Although the weather was pleasant and calm in the southwest of Paris, Europe was not having all its own way.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas served as role models for the Americans, who earned two points on Saturday.
They secured an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has recovered from a four-point deficit in the individual matches only twice, but Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a tie to retain it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament unless it has confidence.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his country's mistrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" over the past year, including halting nuclear tests and missile launches, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received a similar response from the United States,” he said.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of unilateral disarmament.
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an American president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can be considered to have ended the war.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States had insisted on nuclear disarmament first and had increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a declaration of the end of war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall to our knees is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.
Kim did not mention any plans for a second Trump-Kim summit, announced with fanfare by the US leader at the United Nations at the start of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in the last five months, and added: "If the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri's tone was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that missiles from North Korea would be directed towards American soil after "malign" President Trump called Kim Jong-un "rocket man".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said there was still much to do and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its advances.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Security Council on Thursday, "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue energetically and without circumvention until we realize a fully verifiable and irreversible denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions unanimously on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea had denounced its "demands as those of a gangster".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea agreed to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all students are now sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of all-night studying fuelled by caffeine.
A professor discovered that students at the world &apos; s number one university had little idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The impetus for the course came after a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was just hearing about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever spoken to him about the importance of dreams, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that it will not change student behaviour immediately.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as any person has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride in "staying up all night" still existed and added that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and a good night's sleep should be "the secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so students want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
The next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by computer screens and LED lights, which can alter circadian rhythms, so that they will have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal sinks Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression away from home when the attack of Dolly Menga sent Steven Gerrard's disjointed team crashing to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Rangers had wanted their first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had beaten them for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving them eight points behind Hearts, who were the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga's attack came just before half-time and Rangers' uninspiring alignment was never in the game.
Now Rangers are in sixth place, Livingston in third, behind the Hibernians by the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as judge of the line Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance after allegedly being hit on the head by an object from the visitor side.
Gerrard changed eight of the players who won the match against Ayr, entering the Scottish Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt was delighted with the way his well-organised team had outplayed their opponents throughout the game.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when he had it.
They should have been offside at two minutes when Menga made a run to Scott Pittman, who passed between the defence and left Allan McGregor alone in front of him, but the midfielder sent her off.
Keaghan Jacobs was penalized for a foul on captain Craig Halkett, but his partner, Alan Lithgow, could only kick it out of bounds.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction in their play in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the game when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian appeals.
The Rangers had two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly was hardly troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's long-range effort.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute was against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a deep pass from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to score.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as Morelos was able to get the ball to Kelly, but the impressive Kelly blocked his path.
However, Livingston continued to take his guests exactly where he wanted them, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing the way with long drives.
Holt's men could have made more of a late advantage, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow finished off a corner kick that did not count.
The Rangers' substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty at the end of the game after a confrontation with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the “Sunday Morning” Almanac section: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and counting... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, culminating in the Geiger counter.
Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Singing Hills", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans playing apparently incompatible roles as cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium."
When you put on the earphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals”.
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
The method requires extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a common thread among many cancers and re-inject them.
A trial of a vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein called HER2 in many cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancerous cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West embarked on a rant in favour of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was jeered on Saturday Night Live after a performance that was erratic and at times incoherent, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often speak to white people and they ask me how I can like Trump if he is racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began its show with a sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in relation to the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock posted the rant on social media.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
He also told the audience backstage that he had had a hard time wearing the hat.
They messed with me.
They told me not to wear my hat.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I am asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: "Do you want to see me asleep?" and added that he was "going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant that nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to advance?"
Try with love.
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice and Variety reported that SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, saying: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died recently.
West confounded many when he came on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier to sing I Love it.
The support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING AGAINST THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
But I decide not to reward someone (buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) whom I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We also”, he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion, without forgetting the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those roles on screen often told young men they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something had gone wrong" and questioned how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he thought it was "fairly important" to address the issue.
“Personally, I think it is quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?”
What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking of the problems they now face?
Kit believes that television may have a part of the blame for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is being taught on television and in the streets that makes young men feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of the young.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any Game of Thrones spin-offs when the series ends next summer, saying he was "tired of battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard's play about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
He recently revealed that he believes knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he has taken away from Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, I have given my future family and my life from now on.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm in Scotland belonging to Leslie's family.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of these were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV through this route has fallen dramatically, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community faces much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to the lack of appropriate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican senators and says it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) criticized the allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about legislators.
The Democratic leader of Los Angeles said the allegations were being pushed by right-wing commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more lies”, Waters commented on Twitter.
The information allegedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of the United States Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted the information on the Internet during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with Waters' office, and the Capitol released the name of a Waters staff member.
Mr. Waters said: "This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a complete lie.
Waters' statement was immediately criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote: "I am outraged by this information."
This suggests that the necessary temperance to be a Member of Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not get angry.
Do not rebel.
The prosecutor should not be questioned.
He must maintain calm and serenity.
It appears that Fleischer was trying to compare Waters' reaction to the Kavanaugh hearing with the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during his testimony on Thursday.
Republican Omar Navarro, who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
He said: "If that is true, that is very serious."
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations."
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all my staff,” he said.
Johnny English: Back in Action. Rowan Atkinson's Spy Parody Is Short
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit guff in any new British film. It seems to be what is required of this new Johnny English franchise of action and comedy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satire about how clearly ridiculous we are the new opportunity for export for the nation?
Incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has been granted a licence to make a fool of himself for the second time. His name alone gives clues that this is a creation for the territories of non-English speaking film buffs.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent, despite his strange claims to waste glamour, who has a little of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a hint of that type who touched only one note in the Carros de fuego ceremony at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It was originally based on the mysterious man traveller and international figure represented by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television advertisements, causing chaos in its wake.
In this last delivery, there are one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armour as the rotors hit the hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but the humour is somewhat lacking and seems superfluous now that franchises such as 007 and Mission: Impossible are adding comic ingredients without problems.
The humour seems more aimed at children than adults, and for me, the absurd misfortunes of Johnny English are not as clever and well-judged as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all active agents to the consternation of the agent in the field, Kevin Eldon.
It is the straw that breaks the camel's back for the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered character who is seeing his political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best as this character, almost as if she were Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are at risk, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That must be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, though he also teaches clandestine agent skills on the side: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy school like the one in School of Rock.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old chum Bough, now represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married submariner with a captain's stripes, a role he doesn't exploit enough with Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic billionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; English also becomes a pure anarchy when he tries to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house using a virtual reality helmet.
The final sequence was definitely employed to the full, but, however much it may be graced and noisy, the whole still has a slightly childish feel.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help wondering whether the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is working on a plan to have Britons work four days a week and be paid for five.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week, but earning five.
The party reportedly wants the owners of companies that have benefited from the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to give their workers an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "fits" into the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
This change to a four-day week has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: A revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
The four-day working week is a "definite issue" that the party hopes to incorporate into its economic policy, as well as its industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, not all Labour Party members are in favour of this decision.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at the moment."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was prepared to take powers away from "anonymous directors" and "well-heeled" directors of public service companies.
One of the shadow minister's plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders in water companies will not get back all their investment, as a Labour government could make deductions to cover irregularities.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive property funds, with 10 per cent of the shares of private sector companies going to employees, which would yield annual dividends of up to £500.
Senators Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice, and raised the question of whether the results could influence any Republican senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could produce information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
I was in favour of going ahead with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this had happened, after the claim had been made and I asked him: "Did you do it?"
He was firm, resolute, and unyielding.
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
He had already made up his mind about Brett Kavanaugh and would ignore the allegations.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it tersely, Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she names has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive lineup of stars in support of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
If you want to get in for free (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), you have to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or any other thing that serves to raise awareness about your goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or not, or is it just another form of "clicktivism", which is the name given to the stance we take when we believe we are doing something really useful by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favour of a wide range of goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have secured commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly affected almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based investor and implementer association, which is working with the common commitment "to help children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, $35 million has been proposed to help Rwanda end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
Thanks to the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, the donors, national governments and partners like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions asked on its website about what we think can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and hard road and, in many cases, we will stumble and fall.
But, as we have already achieved with the movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the acts we will have at the New York event this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to block the export of energy from Russia - Department of the Interior
In the event that it was necessary, the United States Navy could be called upon to prevent Russian energy from shaking up the markets, including the Middle East, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates on behalf of the legitimate government, was merely a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier of Europe.
Moreover, according to official information, there are ways and means of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the voice of the energy consumer in America."
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternatives in Iran and Russia, he said, were essentially to exploit and replace fossil fuels, while Russia could only do one thing, which was to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made as the Trump administration has been trying to export liquefied natural gas to Europe and to relieve Russia of its role as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, members of the Trump administration, including President Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted throughout that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is valued at $11 billion and is intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington &apos; s fierce opposition to the project is only economic and is another example of unfair competition.
I believe that all of us share the idea that energy cannot be turned into a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
However, the United States has found itself in the position of having to deal with a German rejection of the project.
The German industry association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, will "thoroughly" consider running for president in 2020, she said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women among our leaders, she said, according to The Hill.
I am going to seriously consider the possibility of running for president after 6 November.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a City Hall appearance and said he was "taking the country down the wrong path."
He said: "I really worry about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy."
Warren spoke openly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
A poll on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters themselves did not believe that she should run for president in 2020.
A Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll found that 58 per cent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
A 32 per cent of those surveyed supported his candidacy.
In the survey, former Governor Deval Patrick received 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other Democratic Party members spoke about the possible candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the 2020 presidential election.
Biden said he would make a decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
The situation that my son is going through, everything that has happened since he came back, they know very well the other families that suffer the effects of the TEPT and other wounds that our soldiers return with, &quot; she said to the crowd that gathered at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the "big taboo" that nobody wanted to talk about, and commented on his son and other veterans of war who "return with a different attitude, hardened, wondering whether there is really that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence, which interfered with a domestic violence complaint and possession of firearms under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to develop a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit challenging the new US policy that denies asylum to domestic violence victims or gang members.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a "friendly letter" to Washington on Friday to show their support for a refugee applicant who is currently facing the current policy, according to NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the "Grace v. Sessions" case, which was filed by the ACLU in August 2009 against the federal government, has not been revealed.
He said that his friend and his children, who were members of a violent gang, had abused her, but US officials denied his asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum requests to the United States, as countries facing widespread domestic violence and gang-related problems.
The new asylum policy of the United States reversed a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented domestic violence victims to seek asylum in this country.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made statements on Friday in which he said the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum requests must be rejected on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the individual request and this exception violates that principle, the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also wrote that the policy of denying entry to immigrants was bad for the economy of the United States, as it claimed that immigrants were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "are a necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to domestic abuse and gang violence victims in June.
Asylum seekers can apply for asylum if they leave their country of origin for reasons of persecution or fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, as set out in the 11 June announcement by Sessions.
Asylum was never created as a panacea to deal with all the problems, even the most serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll mounts in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming ever more dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, was trying to comfort her feverish baby at a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for the few belongings they have left in an effort to recover what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building due to the continuing aftershocks, which were also very strong.
I could not help but cry when he told me of the violent earthquake he had experienced while staying on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the rubble of the collapsed wall, he said, and he and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I don't know what has happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are well."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper touting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the United States ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely read newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US Congressional elections, something China denies vehemently.
The accusation that Beijing was trying to influence US elections marked a new phase in a growing US campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publicize their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led both sides to raise tariff levels on imports from each other.
The countervailing duties that China had imposed at the outset of the trade war were designed to fall on exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and business people.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is intensifying that pressure with advertisements in our free press."
To spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and a free press by attempting to place an ad in the Des Moines Register.
In Beijing, where we are now, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China can have on the worrying trajectory that their economy is taking, because the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said one of the most important newspapers in China had declined to publish the article, but did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts say that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are closing ranks behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash could occur, especially among women, in the next midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been intense and many Republicans have said they want to go ahead with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill on Saturday that "you can't go back on this kind of thing."
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) &apos; s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI &apos; s investigation would be enough to calm voters upset about this issue.
Women "are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget tomorrow, and they are not going to forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters who had gathered outside the Senate were singing "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) as the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by the Mic.
Democrats "are fired up and motivated in a way that defies all predictions", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, at the site.
People say that the impact is already very significant, and indeed it is.
But it could be even higher, especially among the indecisive voters in the outskirts and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote but do not like the president.
Even before the public testimony of Ford, who detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee in great detail, analysts had indicated that a reversal was possible if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
The issue has become a "big mess" for the Republican Party, according to Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as reported by NBC News last week.
It is not just a question of the committee vote and the final vote, or even whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench; it is also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know whom to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are now coming out in favour of Kavanaugh.
In a new YouGov poll, 41 per cent of respondents said they believed Ford's testimony was true, while 35 per cent said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony was true.
In addition, 38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30 per cent said the same of Ford.
Following the push by Ford, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of both Flake and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her when she was 17 while drunk.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s when he was studying at Yale.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the technology legend. A company based on the open source platform of the Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "to dominate the world."
He said, "It has to be now."
It was a "historic moment".
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create their own "personal data storage online" or POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, the music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique to online personal data storage is that the user is the one who decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal data training".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's chief executive, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills so that Solid can reach the world.
At present, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform IBM bought, some of the developers on staff working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about whether a "radical change" was going to be introduced, where all their business models were going to be completely changed overnight.
We are not going to ask for permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt, "Its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate over the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee said he was "incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web."
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only English Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, their two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a dense fog and under intense machine-gun and artillery fire".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", pushed the line forward before reaching a single-barrelled cannon and knocking out three of the enemy.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I will never reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which featured the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is apparent when he is shown such strong support".
The MMA followers were up all night for Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig
Imagine that he stays up all night to watch Bellator 206 so that at the end he doesn't get to see the main event.
The San José card featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom at night.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, the UK viewers were left stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a heavy joke".
There is government regulation that governs what is broadcast after 6 a.m., and this was not appropriate, so they had to change the programming to children's shows," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig", yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would change the format to include British viewers in future editions.
When I think about the option of live streaming, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it is at 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are looking at how to do it.
I can tell you that when the schedule changed, we received a great deal of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was a government problem.
I can promise you that it will not happen again.
We will reduce the number of fights from six to five, which is what we normally do. We are trying to give more than usual to the fans and we are going to be late.
That is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but this was what drove him to become a winner.
At 24, he told us that he did not realise that not everyone was like him until he went to secondary school.
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in talking about gay rights was to "transmit hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to take less importance in winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this legendary programme, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne, Daley, who had himself been a social outcast, commented that he had felt "inferior" to the rest of his childhood because "it was not socially acceptable to like children and girls".
She said: "Until today, that sense of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so he was not disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two bronze medals winner at the Olympics has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games held in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he counted them because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass on that "hope" to others.
Three-time world champion Maria Sharapova has said that falling in love with Dustin Lance Black, the American film director, was a surprise even for her.
Daley married last year to an Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
When you live so much from such a young age (she was 14 when she first competed at the Olympics and her father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone your age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
If asked last year, all the answers would have been "I have to win a gold medal", he said.
But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without doubt, Robbie."
His son is named Robert, after his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
He said: "I was not able to tell him that I would not be in the front row."
He said: "I had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it was only at that precise moment that I realised that he was not invincible."
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This was also the inspiration behind his first choice of song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him during the preparation for the Olympic Games. He still got goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who was playing in the event for the 12th time to try to break his own record, was beaten by Furyk in the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the centre of the action, as he has so often been in the United States, the five-time major champion had to content himself with cheering on at times and, at others, trying to perfect his game on the course and thus be able to correct what ails him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form for Le Golf National, where the long rough punishes errant shots.
And if the field is not already daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth round on Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, had started in such an impressive fashion, Mickelson's match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, and could say no more.
He understood perfectly the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that is how it came out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a Ryder Cup career that had never been so clearly defined by the individual.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He said: "He is fun, sarcastic, clever, he likes to mock others; he is a great guy to have on the team."
I think the younger players have enjoyed having him as support this week, too; it was fun.
It is much more than just playing golf."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows only too well that, even with a substantial advantage in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 Ryder Cup at Valderrama, where a Seve Ballesteros-led European team held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end only managed to finish off the other team by a minimum margin, winning 14½-13½.
You keep reminding me that we won a great tournament at Valderrama, we won at Brookline and lost, we won at Valderrama and won, but by a whisker," Bjorn said, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead by 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and the world that this team is not finished.
You have to give it everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
It does not end until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a target to meet, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on our 12 players, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, and that is the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players had achieved on a very difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to go ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual action and that is different.
It is great to share the highs and lows of golf with a partner, but when things are not going well, you really test your golfing ability.
That is the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now it is time to leave your partner behind and go and get the best out of yourself.
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be hoping his players can do better individually than they did as a pair, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points on four.
Furyk has been at both ends of the spectrum in the last few days of those big tournaments and has been part of the winning team at Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah".
He remembered every word, he said, when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had motivated his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-importants tomorrow, but we have to play as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in the same direction, the pressure falls on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of leading the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole route," Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era vessels, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class of frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report in the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the delivery scuppered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class frigates requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We know that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures that are very low.
Among other important features, the vessels are designed to be maintained for longer periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the far reaches of the world) will already be out of date when they begin service, as Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was left idle last year when the German Navy officially rejected the idea of putting it into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a ship has been returned to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that would render the vessel practically useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors: half the crew that had been on the old Bremen class ships.
It was also noted that the ship had an excessive weight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as similar German ships used in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the overall project cost, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached 3,100 billion euros (3,600 billion dollars), rather than the initial 2,200 billion euros.
The problems assigned to the new frigates are of particular significance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction in the naval power of Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy was "running short of ships capable of deploying".
The official said the problem had been getting worse over time, because old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new investigation, which has been carried out in the Highlands of Scotland, is trying to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
What is discovered will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton's bat and brown long-eared bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special bat detectors will be placed strategically on the property to track bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be conducting mobile investigations using portable detectors.
Experts will analyse the sounds picked up on the recordings to discover the frequency of calls from bats and what species make them.
A report and map of the habitat will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for Nature Trust, is hoping the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
With this information, the benefits of habitat management will be determined, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be managed for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affect their nests and habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical cabling can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
Unless they are nocturnal hunters, their ears are more useful than their eyes in achieving their goal.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocation to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The National Trust, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescues.
The organisation has even opened the first and only reserve dedicated to Scottish bats in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
Here at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and the right habitat.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats, so the work we are doing here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop.
It is important to check for bats before undertaking maintenance work within the properties, as this could destroy a breeding colony and kill 400 females and young, which would mean wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Wildlife Trust officer in charge, has urged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species on which we do not know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations while his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations as "fake news" and said people were "trying to get their name out there" at his expense.
His lawyers have been instructed to file a complaint against the German magazine Der Spiegel, where the statements were published.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of having paid $375,000 to conceal the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already amassed 142 million followers just hours after the news was released, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false", said five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo, looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to make a name for themselves by just mentioning me, but I can't help it.
The player smiled and added, "I am a happy man and everything is fine."
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations in what they have called "an unacceptable intrusion into the sphere of privacy", according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, the player's lawyer, said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
It is reported that the incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After allegedly meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to Ronaldo's hotel room, where he is alleged to have raped her anally, according to court documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo had knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good boy" and that he had let him down by the "one per cent" remaining.
In the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "humiliated in public".
The woman, aged 34, says she is trying to annul the agreement because she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged attack took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a big name in Italian football on a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: the UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if we lost our position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.
He said it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily halted.
Mr Clark said: "We need an agreement."
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays at customs in the case of a Brexit without a deal could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 per cent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production paroles at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, general manager of Toyota Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers are the problems that could arise in the supply chains in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on the «just in time» or «last minute» method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to build cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border, according to the sector, which could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to store the equivalent of a day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May &apos; s Chequers plan, which sets out future relations with the EU, was &quot; calibrated precisely to avoid those controls at the border &quot;.
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will not only see us through this moment but will allow us to take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
Toyota &apos; s evidence, among others, is that we can continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful supply chain.
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long term the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union representative at the plant, said his members were becoming increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a clear and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be delayed another week, the White House said Sunday, as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continued.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, connections between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump would fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus compromise the independence of Mueller, has fueled gossip in Washington for months.
In early May, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone he carried himself in an attempt to remove the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied that.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, where news reports said he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not to" fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court."
We will decide on the spot and I will be informing the press as I usually do.
Some journalists would dispute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the presenter, asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the lack of press availability was not due to a dislike of TV reporters who act grandiloquently, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they do."
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President, he said, had more question-and-answer sessions than any other President before him, and cited "unsubstantiated numbers" to back up his claim.
Press briefings will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly the President of the United States, I think that is much better than asking me."
We have tried to do this many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you could speak to the President of the United States."
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press briefings with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
Indeed, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why he was so popular, where he made an uncharacteristically casual and sometimes bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish Government Health Secretary writes to NHS Scotland staff about their fears over Brexit
The Scottish Government Health Secretary has written to the staff of the EU Health and Home Affairs Unit in Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and its wish for them to continue working with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of applications for citizenship for EU nationals working in non-central government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know that all this must be very confusing for you.
And that is why I would like to repeat here how much I value the contribution of each and every member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
The expertise and skills of professionals from across the EU and other countries are invaluable and help to strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count on you.
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing urgent surgery after suffering a head wound
Christion Abercrombie, a player on the Tennessee State Tigers, was treated for a head injury in an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
He said: "He came over and fell over there and then."
Both the coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touchline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A member of the staff at the Tennessee State Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details yet on the type of injury or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State was trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding up to 18 tackles for the entire season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers of property in the UK will be subject to a higher stamp duty when they buy a property, and the extra money raised will be used to provide shelter for the homeless, according to new plans by the Conservatives
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the land transfer tax will be applied to those who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to be spent on the homeless.
The additional revenue raised by the increase in stamp duty on purchases of residential property by non-UK buyers would be used to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is enjoying with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to target those with higher incomes.
The increase in the land transfer tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivize the government to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is an additional levy on the current transfer tax, could rise to as much as 3 per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which is causing house prices to rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas (especially the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping property prices artificially high by buying land in bulk without any intention of using it and urged Mrs May to abolish the "shameful" charges on affordable homes to solve the "shameful" housing problem in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
It also proposes giving local authorities more powers to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my job as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means dealing with the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, should be able to buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland manager says his "primary objective" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited at the prospect of reviving the north-east club, which currently occupies third place in the League One (third tier of English football), three points behind the leaders.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only managed to get a B cap, he told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden with my father and it has always been something I have wanted to do.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I can successfully run a club.
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any fear when he moved to a club with such a big name after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club clearly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
It is not easy to achieve, but I would only consider that I had achieved my goal here when I could return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint in the Hearts technical department.
He helped St. Mirren recover from relegation to the Third Division and helped the Alloa win the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled that "it was probably a real crossroads" when he took over the Alloa.
I always thought that management was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, but it was good, I could make a living from it and I had some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of this work, but I feel good in the direction.
I always wanted to train and now I have achieved it, this is the time of my adult life when I have felt best, without a doubt.
The interview can be heard on Sportsound on Monday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday
The heatwave of summer has boosted takings at British pubs fighting to survive, but has concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have meant that July has maintained the pattern of the previous month, when pubs increased 2.8 per cent on their takings, while restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8 per cent fall in restaurant activity in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their strongest month, compared with most restaurants, where profits were down.
The pubs that mainly serve food also suffered, although not as badly as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just want to go out to drink.
In managed bars and pubs, sales of alcoholic drinks rose by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, hospitality and leisure analyst at RSM said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April."
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of sales in the home-based activities market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8 per cent fall in sales compared with last year is going to be particularly painful given the continuing pressure on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, increased by 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in the number of branded outlets.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, data is collected and analysed from 47 operational groups, with combined revenues of over £9,000 million and is the market reference point.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents' backs
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that their parents and teachers do not know about, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rise in fake Instagram pages
News has heightened fears that the content will be published
20 per cent of the students said they had a "main" account that showed their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) have created secret social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit material will be published.
20 per cent of the students said they had a "main" account that showed their parents, while having other private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw a teenager encouraging others to "violate" her.
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many young people feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of directors of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on both track and field and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim that sport benefits from its international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish, United Kingdom and worldwide athletics community, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from her involvement in its leadership," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to bring things and help to develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics between the four gold medals he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It has been exhausting, but I have recovered fully and am now doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your messages and words of encouragement!
The announcement of the "milking machine" where mothers are compared to cows has divided opinion on the Internet
A baby formula company has divided opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares mothers who breastfeed with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what it claims is the "world's first silent breast pump", technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a video with a somewhat ironic soundtrack that shows mothers counting the freedom they get from the new breast pump.
Four real women dance in a hay barn, with cows, to the tune of "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail", and "Just in case you haven't noticed, these aren't udders, they are my breasts".
The chorus continues to sing: "Feed them, feed them, I am feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I am feeding my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has created a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it puts the spotlight on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
A very unfortunate decision to announce this product by putting cows in the way.
As with us, they have to be pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, except that they take their babies away from them after giving birth, &quot; wrote one person.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly concealed in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Terrifying for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to announce a breast pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a ridiculous announcement."
However, other people defended the announcement, including a woman who admitted that the song was "desterillante".
I think that is a great idea.
If he were still nursing, he would have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but I am not going to worry about it.
It was a "great product", a woman told us.
Another person commented: "It is a funny announcement aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement makes no mention of the dairy sector.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the holders.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who express milk with a pump feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the breastpump, which allows its users to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother ECD and ECD of Mother, comments: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch."
By showing the parallel between expressive women and lactating cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied immigrant minors discreetly sent to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied migrant children detained has increased significantly, despite the monthly flow at the border remaining at near-normal levels.
Traditionally, the majority of sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take in a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal records.
Around 80 per cent of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we are still pursuing these people,” said Albence.
In their rush to process minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum of one month from the date of arrest, instead of 60 days, as was the norm previously, according to workers at the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reports from the centres of reception and the system itself, the longer they are held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
As defenders point out, these concerns are even more acute in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that children's signs of distress will be overlooked due to the size of the facility.
In addition, the move to the camp without having had enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause trauma to many who are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country's war has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the vice-prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue would be "dealt with accordingly".
He said: "They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally."
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this "holy battle" until all Syrian territories were purged of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this war-ravaged country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "planting irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
He said: "We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns."
They are "politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault on Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters, who would be "eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations special envoy, is expected to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee, arguing that the panel should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers surely expect, a resignation or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would surely be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!"
There are no signs of fatigue among the spectators at the moment.
Since 2014, CNN and MSNBC have seen their prime-time ratings double to 1.05 million and 1.6 million, respectively.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in its peak audience, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has surpassed cable news ratings with 3.5 million viewers for its prime-time news programs.
“It’s an odd attraction that we still don’t understand,” Neal Baer, the show’s executive producer, tells us. “Designated Survivor,” a dramatic ABC series about a secretary of state who becomes president after a Capitol attack, is in its second season.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell, author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He recalled a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?
Scovell replied, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Clearly, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information overloads you when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", the $15,000 ostrich skin jacket of Paul Manafort ("a piece of over-the-top pride", in the words of The Washington Post), and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Mario in the same way again.
“Offering something new every night is part of what makes everything seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars” and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he talks about the alternating Trump and daily plot lines (whether it be fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to be left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside his house watching MSNBC and CNN at the same time.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when we used to do all those crazy programmes and people used to say that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilisation,” Fleiss recalls.
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows into the most tightly contested midterm elections in the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that money is flowing into the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the redistricting of a congressional district with two candidates seeking reelection to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, which recently underwent a redesign, is represented by Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Republican Keith Rothfus is Lamb's opponent for re-election, a former Pennsylvania state representative who now represents the old 12th District, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding battle between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight Washington caveat.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Trump Organization were evicted.
The State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US assistance in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on certain visa categories, would have been very painful for Central America and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials in the administration made clear that their intention was to keep the conference going, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a signal of the importance the administration has placed on the meeting.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or reprisals from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House of Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. diplomats, including two career diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
Their explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which is already evident in the public record.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating the possibility that Trump's campaign was working in parallel with Russia on its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable by that chamber, just as he is preparing to run for office again and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and buts, and I am not suggesting that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that his European equivalents will fall.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History turns on these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans now face several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in good shape since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his inability to serve.
Rosenstein says that The Times explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?”
On top of all this, will we vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will be faced with a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador &apos; s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers' optimistic ahead of the Rapid Vienna match
The Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw against Villarreal at the start of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
We got a good result, as Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing we could get something and we ended up with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall the draw was perhaps a fair result.
We were better in the first half, but after the break we came out firing and were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a tough game because they have already got a good result in the previous game. But with the support of the crowd behind us, I am sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be all right.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying themselves immensely and we are having a good training session.
I hope we can move forward, leave last year behind and achieve success.
The fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people spoke about this with their families.
Around half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their partners.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the steps to have that conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Include the conversion of his financial advisor into the conversion, as he may also be able to find a way to pay for these costs.
His long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help him cover costs or to insure himself with his own savings, as long as he has the money.
Negotiate his legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Ensure that a medical power of attorney is obtained to designate a trusted person to oversee his medical care and ensure that the professionals are fulfilling his wishes in the event that he is unable to communicate.
It can also prepare a notarial power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to take financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could he answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
"It's not just about money: who do you treat?" asks Martin.
What medicines is he taking?
Who will look after the dog?
You have to have everything planned out.
Several shots are fired at a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
He has been shot at several times with a rifle while walking home after leaving the house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life threatening and the police have made an appeal for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, officials said. The death toll is expected to rise.
With communications blocked, the relief workers have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, a northern area of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency covers more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The region, which is a lower-level administrative region, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west coast of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Following is a summary of some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of deaths were reported on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake devastated the southern tip of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
A shallow earthquake struck the Aceh Regency in 2016, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 killer earthquake and tsunami.
This time, however, the collapse of buildings did not cause a tsunami, but the death toll was more than 100.
2018: Lombok Island (Indonesia) was hit by a series of earthquakes of great magnitude, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the island's northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away.
Palin was booked into Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 cash bond, KTUU reported.
He was charged on Saturday before the court, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked to make a statement, according to the chain.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $25,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence incident and being in possession of a firearm while intoxicated, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Several veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after a quake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have collapsed and it is expected that the death toll will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just to the north of the Sulawesi centre, which is located to the east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in the New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bike attack on the West Side Highway in Manhattan last October, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of a criminal enterprise, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, the notice of intention states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last death penalty case was processed in the Southern District of New York.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal death penalty in New York was carried out in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg brothers were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked that the flag of ISIS be flown in his hospital room, police said.
He has been acquitted of 22 charges.
One of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, David Patton, said the defendants were "obviously disappointed" with the decision.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma for all those involved in these events.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the popular army" today during a Tory conference protest.
The former leader of UKIP said politicians had to "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided ranks has been highlighted even more by a group of Tory Brexiteers joining a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers agreement on track in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force Euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and "chaos".
Leave Means Leave MP Chris Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a role in the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now, he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile."
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
He dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the protest, where she told reporters: "I am saying one thing: listen to the people.
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it and it is not popular within our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: "First ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the crowd that if politicians were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they would have to "feel the heat".
Now it was a question of trust between the people and their political class, he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat."
We are going to mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory in the Brexit vote and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards from the group after its launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with an application during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing to be called a good Brexit”, he added.
Warren considers all possibilities of running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been much speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 30th town hall meeting since Trump took office.
An assistant asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our "irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top."
A man arrested for the murder of LSU football player Sims
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims the previous Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University in Baton Rouge early on Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-metre-tall Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton to pole position on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes team orders would play a key role in the race.
From pole position Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of the picture by defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to enter the boxes and allowed Hamilton to run in the slipstream, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out with a big push later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton got ahead after a wheel-to-wheel move that left the Ferrari driver with no choice but to give up the inside line at risk of losing out later on in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 on the day, started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap.
He led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
Finally, he came home in 44th place in the final round, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight rounds to recover fourth place from Raikkonen.
It has been a tough day because Valtteri has done a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman in letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect pair,” said Hamilton.
That was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for her insistence that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia Western, the President did not directly refer to the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were "bad, repugnant and false people."
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false”, he said.
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say "But I didn't do it."
I did not do that.
Do you remember?
Senator Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember your response... did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, oh, oh!"
Oh, no.
I did not leak it.
Well, wait a minute.
Have we filtered it? No, we haven't filtered it,” he said while imitating the senator.
A letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and, therefore, I did.
But his refusal did not sit well with the president, who during a Saturday night rally commented as follows: "I am telling you, that was some bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get power and control, according to the president, as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made amends for their Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead of two goals thanks to the attacking play of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the local lead before Dwyer regained the Giants lead.
François Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what was a very lively opening period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at the 13:10 mark before Matt Marquardt tied the game at 15:16 with Cownie.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the second half and secure the victory with the fifth goal of their team as the game approached the final whistle.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
A traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake plane
A traffic controller from Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to batter the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He insisted on ensuring that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
He said, "Our hearts break when we hear this."
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of victims is expected to increase, as there are still many bodies under the rubble and we have not been able to contact many people,” says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Terrific waves that reached up to six metres have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in supplies and aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies."
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there."
This is a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
CNN reported that the protesters were ready.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in the first half of this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the Micronesian air accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one man has disappeared, after saying that 47 passengers and crew had escaped safely from the plane as it sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening, it had been unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk International Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
Jaynes said that was "extremely good".
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to wade through water that reached their waists to reach the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said that passengers panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said the sailors working on a nearby dock improvement project also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the PNG Civil Aviation Authority's Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in PNG over the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A chronology of the night a woman was burned alive is presented by an analyst.
The prosecution wrapped up its arguments in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert on intelligence analysis from the Department of Justice of the United States, testified for hours as an expert witness.
He told the jury how he used the mobile phone records to link the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received data from several mobile phones that showed Chambers was with Tellis the night of his death, contradicting earlier statements by Tellis, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Chambers' mobile phone had been with Sanford's during the time Chambers said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if he was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
Mobile phone records showed that the two men had only met a week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted messages, calls and contact information for Chambers from his phone.
Hale said, "She wiped her life out."
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says hip hop has moved away from its political roots and social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Acts like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for allegedly firing her after she sent them a text message that was allegedly racist.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for wrongful termination after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple deny that it is racist and compare the case with a "shakedown".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her shock at discovering that the new child care worker, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON”, wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing their mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead he was expecting a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received his daily wage and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the termination of her employment with the intention of receiving $350 per day for the six-month position she had been hired for, although without a contract.
He said, "I want to show them that things don't happen that way," and added, "I know it is a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they could not trust her after having offended her.
My wife had sent him something he didn't want to say.
She is not racist.
Joel Plasco, the husband of the woman who was killed, told the Post, "We are not racists."
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had been rude to, even if it was an accident?
To your newborn?
Come on!”
Comparing the demand as "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to go after someone like that?
That is not a very decent thing,” said the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still pending, the couple has been denounced on social media for their behaviour and their logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It was hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before publication."
It is very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC chambermaid before being inspired by a teddy bear to write a children's book, had hoped his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "something bittersweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very calm man who did not like to boast.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if he had a son who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, even though it was not really your achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although he created and was the product of his own imagination, Paddington always gave credit to himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to leave by phone.
As the plane landed, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
She said: "He called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to succeed."
I received a call from Nad to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said: "Tashi, I love you very much."
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep his heart beating were running out and his system was failing.
She had died too soon and everything was going out.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not scream, cry or shout because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was taking place.
He said, "Nobody knew."
I bent my head and the tears were falling all the time.
It is hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much he wanted it.
Women in mourning put up suicide prevention cards to bridge the gap
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
He said: "I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day."
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any place.
However, he left his job before dying, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried about the repercussions."
Davis created the cards "so that people know there are people to go to and people to talk to, even if they are friends."
Don't be silent, you have to talk about it.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been together for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
He did not say he was depressed or anything like that, he tells us.
Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in their attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to overcome it: "It leaves a big hole in the family."
It has left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“If we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited time frame, a limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going down the tubes” in the midst of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican allies not want the FBI investigation to take place?
His refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
Five weeks remain until the midterm elections on November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans have a bad showing, their efforts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling on senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of North Korean deserters "fall" with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the most stringent border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by traffickers, had been the key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of deserters from the north eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and, in many cases, they are repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on nuclear negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on U.S. sanctions.
“Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee to the Supreme Court, was a "historical figure" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Pelosi said she could not help but think that if a woman had acted in that way, she would have been called a hysteric.
Kavanaugh used his emotion to deny the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking as he spoke of his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also condemned explicitly the Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated slanders" organized by some liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his view, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he has pursued Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and the Democrats gained a majority in the House.
Pelosi said: "I will say one thing: If he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he will not be fit to sit on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to sit on the court he is sitting on now."
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which he said was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said: "This is not the time for a hysterical person and an impartial judge to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine."
And women have to pick it up.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and she cannot let it go without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so strange, do you?"
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was talking: "Perhaps you think I am crying because I am sad."
No, I am not angry.
And then he continued with what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger because, in essence, they are not understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once when I found myself crying with an unexpressed rage. An older woman, a serious manager I had always been slightly afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a staircase.
He said, &quot; Never let them see you cry &quot;.
They have no idea that you are furious.
They think you are sad and they will be happy because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when she was caught in an extramarital affair on board the Monkey Business, she had to withdraw from the presidential race, and deeply frustrated, she came up with the idea of running herself.
"It was not a well-considered decision," he said with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they did not need another one.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was already well advanced, it fell behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not enter the race again unless it raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I get a discount?” he asked.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for those who had supported her, frustration with a system that made fundraising difficult and focused on capturing voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown, recalled Schroeder, recalling the reaction of the press.
You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, &quot; What are they going to put on my tombstone?&quot;
Did he «cry»?
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning in early 2018 by imposing tariffs on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs that will affect $200 billion (150 billion pounds sterling) in goods, which will tax half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has responded in kind, recently imposing tariffs of between five and 10 per cent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to retaliate against US attacks, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will back down soon.
To back down would be to concede to Washington, but to publicly submit to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the trade war with the United States could help China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a sudden economic downturn in either country is in fact much more dangerous than the audience has recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, associate fellow at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to receive refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to receive refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions were improving.
The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is still trying to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are still six million people living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Syria's Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had supported the insurgency.
Ryder Cup goes to Europe in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last victory in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe reclaimed the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team won 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson, who had to battle most of the way through the tournament, admitted defeat by throwing his ball into the water on the par-3 16th hole, conceding defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 score since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth fell to defeat by 5 and 4 to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio García, who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European player with the most points in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It has been a very hard year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to get the cup back.
It was a team effort and I am very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now it is the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who beat the legendary American Tiger Woods by two and one in a singles match on Sunday.
I feel an incredible sense of pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, because I have grown up watching this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3 in his career.
This is an odd statistic for one of the all-time greats, who has won 14 major titles, but is still behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting."
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we blew it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Their 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it is our turn to bow our heads.
They have outdone us.”
Red tide update: Red tide concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties are decreasing
The new Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission report shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, irregular flowering conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a reduction in concentrations.
The red tide extends approximately 130 miles along the Pinellas County coast from the north to the south end of Lee County.
Irregular parcels can be found as far as 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
Red tide has also been detected in Pasco County.
During the past week, low-key protests have been reported in Pinellas County and on its coast, low-key protests in Hillsborough County, low-key protests in Manatee County, low-key protests in Sarasota County and on its coast, low-key protests in Charlotte County, low-key protests in Lee County and on its coast, and low-key protests in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwest Florida area during the past week.
