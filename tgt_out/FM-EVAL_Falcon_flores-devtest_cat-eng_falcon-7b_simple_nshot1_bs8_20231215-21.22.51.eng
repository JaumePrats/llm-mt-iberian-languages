This confirms that at least some dinosaurs had plumes, a theory that is already quite widespread, but it also offers details that fossil evidence cannot offer, such as the color and the three-dimensional disposition.

The suspect is under custody pending investigation, but any witness could be rebutted because his image has been published all over the world.
This is a common practice in any other part of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have seen the publication of the photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of the suspects."
The Corona office, the one in charge of the accusations, has indicated to the journalists that they will not make any more declarations, at least until the sentence.

A study published today in the journal Science describes the formation of a new species of owl on the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University and the University of Uppsala in Sweden have informed that the new species has evolved only in two generations, although it was thought that it would take much more time for this process, because of the increasing population of Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortis (endemic), and the Galapagos finches, Geospiza conirostris (foreigner).
The gold can be worked in all forms. It can be molded into figures of smaller size.
It can be inserted in the first lines, which can be twisted or flattened in mines.
It can be very dangerous and it can pile up on other metals. It can pile up so much that sometimes it covers the images painted on books named "illustrated manuscripts".
This is the pH of a substance. You can use a pH indicator to test it.
The acid from the columbite ore is a basic substance.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (H) in the substance analyzed.
The ions of hydrogen are protons, which are the same as the electrons (since the atoms of hydrogen consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two policemen together and then, with the wet clothes, make a ball.

When you use a satellite to find someone who is a thousand kilometers away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite picked up the signal and reflected it back to us almost instantly.
The satellite will be sent to space. The scientists use telescopes in space to see the Earth because the atmosphere distorts part of our light and our vision.
A giant crater more than 100 meters deep to place a satellite dish or telescope in the space.

There are more animals of medium size than small ones, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small mammals (including feral cats) that prey on the small prey that are most abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of his escape is the concept of n√≠nxol, a special work that each has and that prevents them from competing with each other.
The lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by a very strong adult males related to each other and to 30 females and calves.
The females are very closely related, forming a large family of Germans and girls.
Lion bands are composed of large numbers of lions and leopards, which are animals with a surprising similarity to lions (although not to other large felines) and are also mortal prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (even if it is not very high), jump, run and jump with 5 times the force of a human being.
The tiger is of the same group (genre panther) as the lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not the roar of a tiger, but more like a phrase shouted in a foreign language.
The ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they hunt mice, snakes, scorpions and lizards. They hunt all the animals that are hunted are much smaller than them.
The scientists believe that the ocelots follow the scent of the animals that are killed (presumably) and are able to track them by the trails they leave behind.
They can see very well in the dark, and they can also move very silently. The ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the environment, and then they attack their prey.
When a small group of people (a small population) is separated from the main group (for example, by building a forest or a river, or by emigrating to a new island and not being able to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations different from those needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not moved or even survived, they are still in need of the same adaptations as before.
With time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to seem less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands of years and millions of years, the two species were so different that they could no longer be considered the same.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and take carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. they breathe out).
Plants make their food by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and with plants. The majority of what we build with are plants. Without plants, most animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, except for other Mosasaurs.
Their mandibles have more than 70 teeth, including a pair of tusks, and a secondary jaw that allows them to bite through the skull, so there was no way for a victim to escape their path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a bifurcated tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's possible that he was a cannibal.
They also attacked anyone who entered the water; not even a T. rex could compete with a Tyrannosaurus rex.
And that the majority of their food was familiar to them, the Romans had some rare products or unusual dishes at their banquets; such as swans, peacocks, quails and rosegators.
Another difference was that, while the poor and the destitute were given food in a cart, the men were enjoying banquets and feasting while reclining.
The antics of the Romans could not have included food that had arrived from Europe or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they don't have any bread, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate, or coffee, and the only thing they have is a goat that will be killed.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
The poor people sacrificed themselves to the gods and the priests tried to cover the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard open to the sky and only the priests could enter the sanctuary.
Sometimes they build special pyramids in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The tower was a special place for the gods.
In the mild climate of the Orient, the habitat was not so important.
The majority of the Jewish family's life took place in the open air.
The women were in pain; the trees were simply markers of the road. They used the stone to build houses.

Greenland will be a very sparsely populated country. The Nordic countries have declared that Eric the Red is going to exile himself from Iceland because of an assassination and, while traveling west, he will discover Greenland and give it the name.
Well, then, when they discovered it, there were already Eskimos living there.
Although all of these countries were "escandinaus", there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that at the end of the Declaration of Independence there was a map of the treasure.
Well, that's not certain. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a map of the treasure.
At the back of the Declaration of Independence there are the words "Declaration of Independence original with date 4 July 1776". The text is found at the bottom of the document, on the left.
And that no one knows for sure who wrote it, we know that the first lines of the poem (29¬æ inches by 24¬Ω inches) were rolled up to enclose it.
So, it seems that the note is just a tag.
The landings of the day D and the battles that will come after will free the north of France, but the south is still not free.
It was governed by France "de Vichy". It was negotiating with Frenchmen who had signed the pact with Germany in 1940 and who were going to collaborate with the invaders in front of the enemy.
The allies landed in southern France on August 15, 1940, the invasion was named "Operation Dragon".
Only two weeks after the crash, the Americans and the French had liberated the south of France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city, and civitas, which means city or state, and so on, and so forth, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and so on, and
The city-states precede the nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural endeavour and an equitable diffusion.
The minoritie cultures often disappear without leaving any traces of their history and are not recognized as civilized cultures.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government, which was the Congress, its only component. The Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, since there was no judicial authority in the country, it had to resort to the authorities of the state, which were often poor cooperatives, in order to make them carry out all their acts.
There was no authority to invalidate the tax laws and the treaties between states.
The Articles require unanimous approval of all the states before they can be put into effect and the states will take so long to agree that the central government's representatives often stay away.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and will be the champions of the world in the FIFA World Cup 2006.

The Japanese count with 7.000 islands (Honshu is the biggest one), which makes Japan the 7th biggest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, sometimes we call it, in geographical terms, an "archipelago"
The first European explorers of Taiwan in the 15th century named the island Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in the south-east of Taiwan, and begins the transformation of indigenous practices and the recruitment of Chinese workers for the plantations of rice and sugar.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas of the west and north of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in our complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the original buildings looked like.
In 1976, the Machu Picchu had been restored to 30% of its original state and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common format of film is 35mm, which was the standard size of film during the era of film photography.
The image is still being produced today, but the most important thing is that the aspect ratio has changed in the digital cameras.
The 35mm format creates, of course, a little confusion, with 36mm of extension and 24mm of height.
It is said that the ratio of 3:2 is the best ratio for the number of entries to obtain the simplest ratio.
Many common formats (such as the APS family) are very similar to this aspect.
The rule of thirds, which has been widely used and often ridiculed, is a guideline that creates dynamism and keeps the order in an image.
The most efficient place to shoot the subject is in the intersection between the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example).
During this period the European history is going to pose the question of the Catholic Church, which has been rich and powerful.
During the next thousand years, Christianity will unite the European states despite the differences in language and customs.
His power is omnipresent, affecting kings and plebeians alike.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial resources should exist precisely for this reason.
The main authority of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and diners will cause many people to ask if this dogma was ever questioned.
Shortly after the start of the hostilities, Brittany began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy will prove to be effective, as the vital organs of the military and civilian ministries are still functioning, even though this blockade violated international laws that have been codified by various international agreements in the last two decades.
The Bretanya will mine the international waters to prevent any vessel from entering in full segments, posing a threat to all neutral vessels.
As a response to this limited tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine warfare without restrictions.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and non-intervention.

In 1884, Tesla will move to the United States to accept a job offer from the Edison Company of New York.
They will arrive in the United States with four hundred pounds of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the last man to die in the last poem that Thomas Edison will write).
The Ancient Xina had a unique way of showing different historical periods: each dynasty was a different family.
There was also a period of instability in the dynasties. The most known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between many noble families who were fighting for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods of the ancient China, thousands of people were dying while trying to escape the city of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single governor.
Just as the revolution is going on, the occupations are going to open to all the houses that apply for it, allowing the most ambitious and successful to get it.
This also applies to the military, because in the place where the military bases are located, they will start to base themselves in the relevancy.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed is deeply interested in assuming responsibilities that go beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that would be known as "Hira" to the Mountain of "Noor" (light) in order to contemplate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, gives a very clear image of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely filled with the rest of the world.
Of course, and even if they know about it, it is not easy to find. The cave is absolutely inaccessible and you have to climb down into it.
No one has seen the remains of a cell phone or a broken down car in the area. There are very few places where you can see or feel the inside of the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians during the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many great pyramids built to honor the Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Valley of the Kings", is a region in Egypt containing various pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), various tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Kheops, and many other pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built in honor of the Pharaohs and members of his family.
The signal "of great magnitude" is assembled to the letter V (lowest) and the "of great magnitude" seems like a grap or a square without the lower side.
When the impact is big enough that it is necessary to start from the tip and go up, and when it is small enough that it is necessary to start from the top and go down.
Tying the ropes to the right side creates a more comfortable, but less secure position. Tying the ropes to the left side creates a more secure, but less comfortable position.

The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Theresa, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the German wife of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a car, they were going to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd will force the king and queen to open all the windows of the car.
At some point, a member of the crowd shows the head of a royal guard assassinated in front of the Queen before her horrified eyes.
The expenses of the imperialism of the United States during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the own people of the Philippines.
We will have to pay taxes to the colonial regime in order to pay for the good part of the expenses and interests of the good ships in the name of the Filipino government through the banks of Wall Street.
According to the official report, the large chunks of the debris are the remains of the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people by the imperialist United States.

The period in which the events are taking place is the Plena Edat Mitjana, the period of history in Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000 - 1300 AD).
The Pleistocene Age was preceded by the Upper Pleistocene Age and followed by the Lower Pleistocene Age, which ended around 1500.
Determinism is a term that is used in practice in a wide range of ideas, from the technological imperative or the imperative of technology to a strict sense that the human being is guided by a hidden logic that is associated with the scientific laws and the manifestation of technology.
The majority of the deterministic technological interpretations share two general ideas: that the technological development follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influences, and that technology, at the same time, has "side effects" on societies that are inherent, in place of being socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the roads need to be developed.
In fact, a network of highways across the country is not economically viable, so we are developing new methods of production to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The possession of large amounts of cash also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism will have an important deterministic cultural component, written by Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romanticism context, geography gave shape to people, and with time, cultures and customs appeared related to that geography that were better than those imposed arbitrarily, since they were found in harmony with the place and the society.
Thus, Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, and Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in the feudal world.
His fame as an epicentre of luxury is going to start in the year 400 dC and will last until approximately the year 1100 dC.
His status will change during the next 100 years, especially because the Croats have brought back obsequies (funeral offerings) that are more valuable than those offered by the Byzantines.
It will be in this moment when the title of fashion capital will go from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style will be the most popular style during the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slowness of the communication canals, the styles can arrive up to 25 to 30 years late.
At the end of the 19th century, the western part of Europe will start to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the time is that, as a result of the crusades, the people start to use buttons to button up their clothes.
The subsistence agriculture is the one that is due to end up by producing only food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native plants of the region combined with other techniques such as crop rotation or other simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, the majority of the pages are dedicated to subsistence agriculture, and it is so in many nations in the process of development.
The subcultures gather people with similar ideas who feel abandoned by the standards of society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of its members.
The qualities that determine a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often distinguish themselves from other subcultures by the use of distinctive style, fashion, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to recount the few cases of unfortunate infants who will not be socialized by adults because of negligence, bad luck, or abuse.
These children were named "savages" or "ferals". Some of them were saved by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of children was due to the difficulty of raising a child with intellectual or physical disability by their parents.
The rescued children may have suffered from maltreatment or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Other animals are said to have been created by animals; some say that they have survived all the days.
The baby rescued, which is only created by animals and not by humans, presents behaviors (within certain physical limits) similar to those of the animal that it is created by, such as the paw or the indifference towards humans.
However, the knowledge gained from this project will be more accessible and more interesting, the village will be one step closer.
The theory of the crash is not a method of learning, but an aid that provides support to individuals who submit to a new experience of learning, like learning to use a new software or starting a new project.
Bastides can be virtual or real: in another way, a professor is a virtual bastide, but also he is the little clip of Microsoft Office.
The virtual villages are internalized in the program and are thought to be used to question, show and explain procedures that could have been very complicated for the student to understand.
The children are given in custody for different reasons such as abandonment, passing through extortion.
No one would have survived in that environment, not even if they were well fed and well educated, but there is only one.
I think that the system of family reunification is a way to ensure the safety of these children.
Our system of reception must provide safe, loving care, stable education and reliable health care.
It is supposed that all the needs that were not covered in the house where they were going to take them originally.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet bring about additional dimensions in terms of the focus of uses and gratifications.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "relations in the making" are also identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigate the reaction of the public to web sites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it was stated that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by interpreting correctly their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, indicated that people are not able to hear the king's speech because of brain damage but they are able to evaluate the sincerity of the speech.
It is suggested that these capacities of human interpretation of behavior could be shared by domestic animals.
In the 20th century, the investigation has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: exposed and protected.
The mutation introduces a new genetic variation, and the selection eliminates the combination of variations that expresses the genetic patrimony.
The segregation and recombination of the genetic material combine the variation that has occurred in the past and the recombination between the two genetic pools in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human digestive system to satisfy its nutritional needs with the available plant resources.
Moreover, there are also some bad consequences: malnutrition, dehydration and finally death.
The easiest to obtain resources are the fruits and vegetables, but they must be cooked, as these are difficult to digest for primates, like us humans.
In the change, the food of animal origin (ants, termites, ous) is digested easily, but they also provide a great amount of proteins that contain all the essential aminoacids.
However, we were not surprised to find that our ancestors had solved the problem of proteins long ago, as we see today with the chimpanzees of the savannah.
The interruption of the sound is the process of falling asleep during the normal period of sound and waking up after a nap (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do with a small alarm clock that wakes you up but not completely.
If you are one of the ones who rebooted the router while sleeping, try to place it at the other end of the room, so that you have to turn it off.
Other options based on biochemistry include drinking a lot of liquids (especially water or tea, a common diuretic) before going to sleep, so that one has to wake up to urinate.
The quantity of dead people inside is correlated to the quantity of tension in the body and the spirit of the same.
With less oxygen, the tension is lower and the vital force is higher. Each person has the potential to find pain and satisfaction.
We all arrived at the illumination. The only thing that stands in our way is our own negativity and pessimism.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is spreading by the way of the love of Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of the kundalin√≠ yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With the Kundalini Yoga, the energy kundalini (illuminated energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is yoga. By visualizing various states, the channels of energy are activated and consciousness is created.
The Soviet Union was the enemy of the Second World War, which will make the collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States easier. With the armistice, the two countries will be able to exchange systems, processes and cultures, and all the countries will be at war.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies and the axis were enemies again.
It will prolong the forty years following and it will be fought by delegated experts in battlefields of Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the bridge over the river Rhine.
These plans will become obsolete by the end of the night, when more than 800,000 Soviet troops of the Red Army will enter and create the front lines in Belarus and Ukraine after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Pact of Non-Aggression between the Soviet Union and Poland and other international, bilateral or multilateral treaties.
Using satellites to transport goods and, with some difference, the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of the Marines has been to ensure that your country has the capacity to save lives and property, while at the same time interfering with the capacity of your enemy to save their lives and property.
One of the most recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans were trying to move supplies and homes across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the moment, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to salvage the wreckage.
If the planes had crashed, it is likely that Germany could have conquered Great Britain, just as it will do with the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats are being domesticated for the first time in 10.000 years in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
Old cultures and tribes have started to domesticate animals for easy access to meat, skin, and fur.
Domestic cattle should be kept in herds that graze in pastures or other areas of pasture, often watched over by shepherds who are children or adolescents. These methods of grazing are still used today.
The trains will be built in England in the 16th century.
But even if the lives of the passengers consist of nothing more than the lives of the passengers, the trains with horses to accelerate the speed and carry heavier loads in the more difficult parts of the route.
The roads were forced to be kept open in order to maintain the lives of the victims. Thus, the helicopter will see that the lives would be more efficient if they had a metal cover.
This will become a common practice, but the rails will wear out more on the wheels of the trains.
In the end, the rails of the locomotive will be replaced by iron rails. The first completely iron rails will be introduced in the year 1767.
The first rescue team arrived at the crash site and found the survivors walking out, having been there for two million years.
The Australopithecus were not walking on two legs as we do.
They found specializations of bipedal australopithecines between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, and that the sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs over 7 million years ago.
We can start to live in a more respectful way with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can do it all and totally be activists to reduce the pain that could exist in the future.
This works only for the symptoms. If we want a permanent solution, we have to find the root of the problem and we have to disable it.
It is evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and that the problems have increased due to the excessive population and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After the adoption of the Declaration of Independence by the Congress on July 4, 1776, the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary of the Congress, Charles Thompson, sent a copy of the Declaration to the press of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, which is now known as "Dunlap's Volants".
The first public reading of the document will take place on July 8th at the Independence Hall.
George Washington was sent a telegram on July 6, 1789, which arrived in his troops on July 9, 1789. A copy was sent to London on August 10, 1789.
The 25 survivors of Dunlap who are still unaware that there are copies of the original document. The original manuscript has not been perused.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and that they are still alive. In the meantime, birds.
Many people don't see dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many birds that assemble into a dinosaur.
They have broken legs and broken arms, they are carried and walk on their own two legs like a tyrannosaurus.
Practically all the computers that are used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can only have two possible values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called bits, according to the jargon of the computer science.
The environmental impact may not be immediately evident. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general and can not be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator of an internal disaster is the presence of medicines or household chemicals that are toxic.
Instructions on how to use specific first aid supplies were given on the label.
The term insect is used in a formal way for this group of insects.
This term derives from the anti-parental instinct of the xinxes, which are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
The red-tailed hawks and the red-shouldered hawks are very rare, adapted to see in the new or old habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it the most common neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged people.
EM is a neurological disease that affects the central nervous system, the spinal cord and the optic nerve.
The research concluded that women have twice the probability of suffering from multiple sclerosis than men.
One can decide that swimming is not the best for one's interests or the interests of one's child.
These parallels could be used for adoption.
A child can be adopted by a couple if the other parent has died or has abandoned the child.
The main objective of science is to explain the world through the scientific method. Indeed, this method guides the vast majority of scientific research.
Yes, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a proof used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers are going to focus on the texts of the classics and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
They will accept all of Aristotel's opinions on all scientific assumptions, including psychology.
This way, the Greeks' knowledge will be diminished, and the Orient will be disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that are observed in the physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of circadian cycles and the production of endogenous molecules.
The rhythms of the periodic nature, which are not simple responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in the majority of cases, such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological oscillations are self-sustaining and follow a period of inertia until external signals are absent.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase are going to serve as carriers of the virus, in order to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted to determine the DNA of the virus with <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">radioactive</span> <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">phosphorus</span> or <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">radioactive</span> <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">proteins</span>.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the amount of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only mutations in the germinal cells of the ovary can be transmitted to the daughter cells, and mutations in any other cell can cause cell death or cancer.
The tourism based on the natural environment attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife.
Examples of activities in situ include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and nature reserves.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, the people of the small rural villages go to their work and pass by the site of the other work that has just been abandoned.
In this dynamic vehicle, somehow, is connected to, and is supported by, a system of private transport.
Science shows us today that this gigantic economy of carbon has collapsed one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has given support to the evolution of man during the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport system. The only complaint is that the system is not working.
The countries that develop rarely feel the quality of water or the subsidence of bridges.
Why do we have this problem with the transport systems? Why do they fail so often? Are the engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental?
The Flow of Traffic is the study of the movement of individual conductors and vehicles between two points and the interactions that are established between them.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver with 100% certainty.
For example, the conductors tend to behave in a relatively constant range; however, the flow of traffic tends to be constant and can be approximately represented mathematically.
In order to represent better the flow of traffic, relations between the three main characteristics of the roads have been established: (1) grade, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help with planning, design and construction of the roads.
The insects will be the first animals to conquer the area. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to double their weight by forcing their way through the skin.
This provides a great variety of small locations that can be used to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the dragonfly and the mayfly.
For miles, a man named Aristarc will say that the solar system is moving around the Sun.
Many people thought that the one who was going to die was the one who was right, but many people thought the opposite; that the Solar System was moving towards the Earth, including the Sun (and all the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, or does it?
The Amazon river is the second longest river in the world and the largest river on the planet. It transports 8 times more water than the second longest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes it is more than a mile wide.
20% of the water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon river is 6.387 km long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The construction of pyramids with stone will continue until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the technique and the excellence of the construction of the pyramids of Gizeh will not be surpassed.
The Egyptians of the New Empire were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which had been built more than 1000 years before.
The population of the Vatican City is of 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is also the language of the majority of the people who live in the state, while the Latin language is used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
It is known that some basic chemical elements such as carbon, silver and copper can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposes that all things are composed of four elements. These are earth, water, air and fire.
The four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, all and more, according to their theory, change into new substances that form what we see.
The alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. The periodic table has many elements.
The elements of the crash are considered to be metals. It is clear that there are other metals such as silver and gold.
He also said that the plane could have been carrying small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The whole universe is made of matter. All matter is made of atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms in the final part of this sentence.
This way, the pencil will become a good friend of many people when it will invent.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status.
In the actual situation, people are writing messages on the computer screens, without needing a punch-card.
They can ask what will happen to the keyboard when the next earthquake strikes.
The nuclear bomb works by fusing two nuclei together, creating a large amount of energy.
Similar to when you have to push a heavy cart. Separating the nucleus from this energy.
Some of the atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break apart in a small collision or none at all.
The surface of the Moon is covered with rocks and poles. The outer layer of the Moon is called "scorched".
The search area measures 70 km in the north and 100 km in the south.
It is more difficult to reach the crash site under the moon and more difficult to reach the mountains.
It may be that the face is more visible because the lava is more recent. It would have been easier for the lava to come to the surface.
Theories of content are centered on finding what pleases or interests the people.
These theories suggest that the people had certain needs and desires that have been internalized so that they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes people do certain things and what they do that makes certain things happen.
Two famous theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, there are two behaviors that can be observed in this situation: the administrators start to lead their colleagues. One extreme of the spectrum is to try to follow "a new way" (the noia).
This type of officer has problems taking unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary actions, has a hard time evaluating actions, assigning responsibilities and making others responsible for their actions.
In the case of the other, he is transformed into an individual who feels that he must change everything that has been done by the equipment and make it his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the mission.
This behavior often ends up in a fistfight between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtual equipment is subject to the same standards of excellence as the conventional equipment, but with some small differences.
The members of a virtual group will be able to communicate with each other through a contact point.
The police have more autonomy than the conventional units, since they can meet up according to different zones and the local police may not understand.
The presence of an "invisible presence" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a component of a virtual team.
The "invisible" team is the administrator who addresses each member. The invisible team establishes the standards for each member.
Why would you need a long process to establish an organization to teach people? One of the objectives of this organization is to put into practice concepts of learning organization and innovation.
Creativity and the resources available can be used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, the joint work of an organization that can overcome a difficult situation can lead to a process that is innovative in responding to the needs of the client.
In order to be innovative, the leader must create a culture of innovation within the organization, as well as knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the approach in continuous mode as a method to help organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data will provide physical proofs for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, the area of investigation will be reduced and the research will be much more accurate.
The correlation between brain injuries and the behavior of the scientists is being investigated.
It takes a long time for different types of damage, trauma, lesions and brain tumors to affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The new technologies allow us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain earlier than ever before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build models that will help us to understand processes in our mind.
The fact that the AI has strong connotations of science-fiction, forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence involves machines that can automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of these are control, planning, programming and the capacity to respond to diagnostic and inquiry questions from the client as well as the recognition of handwriting, sight and sound.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The system of the AI is frequently used in various economic, medical, engineering and military applications, since it has been built in various domestic and video games.
The thematic aspects are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual travels. Students can visit museums, see aquariums or contemplate the beauty of art while they are in class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share the experiences with future students.
For example, every year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to Washington, DC, each year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students. However, students can start with a grammar and spelling mistakes, which can change with the existence of a public.
As students are often the most critical, the blogger started to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogs "force students to be more aware of the world than the media". The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be more alert and curious (Toto, 2004).
The blog is an example of how students can collaborate and expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The use of blogs "could help students to be more analytical and critical; they could define their own positions in the context of the other students and also highlight their own perspectives on specific issues in concrete terms.
Ottawa is the enchanting bilingual capital of Canada and it has a series of art galleries and museums that show the past and present of Canada.
To the south there are the Niagara Falls and to the north the beautiful natural reserve of Muskoka and more inland.
These are all the elements, among others, that make Ontario a city that is welcoming to all newcomers, including those from other countries.
The population of the large extensions of the north is more sparse, and some zones are still uninhabited lands.
For a comparison of populations that are usually surprising: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadian citizens.
The islands of the East African coast are located before the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the most different continent, and a continent in itself when it comes to life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as tourist destinations on the beach.
The Arabs also bring Islam to the lands, and they will take a great path to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route to India.
North, the region borders the Sahel, and south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
The women: It is recommended that any tourist should declare that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also useful to carry a ring (one that doesn't look like a wedding ring).
The women were being asked to explain why the differences in culture could cause them to be considered as victims, and not to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
They refuse to leave their homes, and we can't defend them (with or without cultural differences, it doesn't matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by fishermen from the Xth century, Phoenicians, Romans and Berbers, who used it as a strategic port, which was named Anfa.
The Portuguese will destroy it and will rebuild it under the name of White House, only to abandon it after a terratr√®mol in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco will rebuild the city with the name of Daru l-Badya, the name of Casablanca comes from the Spanish traders who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting places to visit in Morocco.
The old Medina of Marrakech is a good place to find traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, terrissa, objects of pell, narguils, and a large variety of souvenirs, but it is not designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the extreme east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma will be destroyed by the lava of Nyiragongo, which will bury the majority of the roads of the city, especially the center.
If Goma is as safe as it is claimed to be, it would be wise to investigate the situation before sending any visitors to this city to assess the state of the fighting in the province of Kivu Nord.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the gorillas of the mountain range of the most economical in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get to Goma. The normal price (local) is 500 Congolese francs for the trip.
Combined with the relative inaccessibility of the site, "Timbuctu" has ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic lands, lunar landscapes.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, but it is also a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it will be included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of the sand dunes.
One of the main highlights of the special "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates for PBS.
The city is found in a very different context from the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab feel than African.
The Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa and covers the border with Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km¬≤ and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each one with its own unique wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the reference of the national parks of South Africa (SANParks).
In order to enter the national parks in South Africa, you have to pay a daily conservation fee.
It is also possible to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa, as well as all the National Parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the main island of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists consider the center of the city.
The silhouette of the urban area of Hong Kong has been related to a graphic of bars that is clearly visible with the presence of the Victoria Harbour's aiguilles.
In order to get the best views of Hong Kong, he abandoned the island and crossed the Kowloon Bay promenade.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is located on the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonists will settle, since it is a good starting point if you want to explore the past of the territory.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is now called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only swamps of mangroves, but also include some of the last remaining patches of the powerful jungles that once covered the entire planet.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km¬≤, of which 1,500 km¬≤ are covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for the endangered life, and it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Asiatic elephants in the area.
The buses from the interurban bus station (on the other side of the river) run all day, but most of them, especially those that are directed to Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6:30 and 7:30.
As buses between districts often get full, it is recommended to buy a ticket with some days of advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
The shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to the places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The bridge of the Oyapock river is a bridge that is falling. It has been built at the long of the Oyapock river in order to join the cities of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock to the Guiana French.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters and two lanes of 3.5 meters width.
The open space under the bridge is 15 meters high. And even though the final construction was completed in August 2011, it will not be possible to cross it until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be fully functional by September 2017, when the Brazilian delegation will be in place.
The Guarani people are the most important indigenous group living in the Paraguay Oriental, and they were also hunters and gatherers who also practiced agriculture for subsistence.
The Chaco region was the home of other indigenous groups such as the Guaycur√∫ and the Payagu√°, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
The Paraguay, formerly known as "The Province of the Great Indians", will be created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native groups.
The Spaniards will start the colonization period that will last three centuries.
From the foundation of Asunci√≥n in 1537, the Paraguay has managed to keep a great part of its character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams in the world.
The most important annual sports event in this country takes place in December at the polo camps of Las Ca√±itas.
Here you can also see smaller pieces and parts of the plane that were scattered around during other times of the year.
For news about the polo matches or to buy tickets for the matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Malvines is the FKP, with a value equivalent to a British pound (GBP).
The meals can be scanned on the only island, which is located in front of the FIC West store.
Usually, the British accept the surrender of the islands and also of the credit and dollars of the United States.
The islands in the periphery probably won't accept credit cards, and they can accept British and American money; they proved this by asking the owners in advance which method of payment they accept.
It is impossible to get money out of the Malvinas without going through the islands, so we will have to go there.
As Montevideo is located in the southern hemisphere, it is summer when the northern hemisphere is winter, and viceversa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures are usually over 30 ¬∞C.
Winter temperatures can be very cold: temperatures rarely go below zero, but the humidity and the wind combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no particularly "wet" or "dry" stations: the amount of rain is more or less constant throughout the year.
However, most of the animals of the park are used to seeing humans, so they are not wild animals and they should not be fed or bothered.
According to the authorities of the park, the bones and remains of animals are located at a distance of 100 yards/meters from the crash site and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the animals that were saved!
For more daring than that, bears, wolves, ants, alligators and big cats can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured by not keeping a safe distance. These animals are large, endangered and potentially dangerous, so they need their space.
In addition, you should take into account that the smell of the bones and other animals that survived, so you should avoid cooking or eating smelly foods and keep the camp site clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850 and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port will be the scene of a famous mutiny in 1889, when ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon it.
All the ships will be sunk, by a British destroyer. In addition, they will lose 200 American and German lives.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful meeting in the city will result in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are abundant, since Auckland is the head of two ports. The most popular ones are located in three zones.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) are facing the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay, north, to Devonport, south.
Most of them are beaches of sand and are safe, and most of them have shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are the Waitemata Harbour, the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers and the central Auckland.
These are some of the beaches where you can find a good variety of shops along the coast. It is safe.
The most popular beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is refreshing. The other local beer is "Manta".
They can take many French wines, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia are not able to tolerate the journey.
It is the only water source in the area, but if you look hard enough, you can find it.
For the Australians, the concept of tallat is foreign. A cup of coffee is a cup of coffee, the head is full of cream (without foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate is melting above the Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent but the quality of the chocolate is not.
During the whole year there are many trips to the scene and only few serious injuries caused by these causes.
Following this, follow all the recommendations of the authorities, and pay close attention to all the warnings of security.
The cubozous are found in the beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April. They are also found outside of these months.
Taurons exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most taurons fear humans and stay away from them.
The saltwater crocodiles are not active in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton.
Reserving a room in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
The agents of the police often have agreements with hotels, so that they can reserve other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a police agent.
The agents of the police often offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport and all kinds of packages combined with flight and hotel.
We can also maintain the reserve if we need more time to think about the offer or to present other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any request or suggestion should be sent to the airline and not to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of the audience decides to camp right there, and the vast majority of the audience consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be part of the action, you'll have to wait until late in the evening to find a place to camp near the music.
Remember that the music is still going on in the main stage, so you can still hear some bands playing until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you believe the North Atlantic is the best place to spend the winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice generates a terrible pain in the most affected.
The rescuers in St. Petersburg include a time in the city. The rescuers of passengers are exempt from the visa requirements (proved the conditions).
