The Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM, for short) are concerned about appearing "like muppets."
Some Members of the Assembly are baffled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for short).
The confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Welsh Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the House from all political spectrums are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Member of Parliament said that his group was concerned that the name might be "Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales, twp means twat and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that "the whole group was unhappy" and had suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the leap from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be for the Members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed strong support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the option MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
The Members of the Assembly are reportedly suggesting alternatives, but the fight for consensus could stall the efforts of Assembly President Elin Jones, who would have to send the bill for the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
The Members of the Assembly will have the final say on how they should be called when they vote on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will decide on Sunday whether their country will change its name to "Republic of Macedonia North."
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonia &apos; s President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
The referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin &apos; s bells are silent in Harlem churches
“Historically, the older people I have talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“Today, there is neither one nor the other.”
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
People now socialize in other ways, he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods that people regularly visit.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "in the end, they will come back to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who would not help the remaining temples in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore they will accelerate the closing of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin in 1880.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped in the building acquired it.
A black congregation took over San Martin under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were resisting hiring or promoting blacks.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged, while the congregation of Father Johnson made plans for its reconstruction, also commissioning the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly called them "the poor man's campaigns."
In July, the expert who struck the gong called it &quot; a cultural treasure &quot; and &quot; an irreplaceable historical instrument &quot;.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first snare drum used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who played the snare drum at Riverside Church, a larger one, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the laity leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the parish governing body, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese &quot;attempt to pass the costs on to the parish council, &quot; although the council had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiger shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the first day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about an hour Saturday morning when they heard the child calling for help, so they swam over to help him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then realized he was screaming that he had been bitten.
Hammel noted that the boy had a broken collarbone as he approached.
Hammel added, "I yelled at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark."
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children &apos; s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, the rescue swimmer, told a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper chest area.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there were more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's beauty plans are driving the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff working in their style and beauty departments.
In order to significantly boost the United Kingdom's beauty market, valued at £2.8 trillion and growing at a rate higher than the fall in fashion and homeware sales, the largest beauty halls in the country will be tested in 11 shops and, if they succeed, in more shops next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be devoted to televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup line with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to daily small-quantity purchases at local stores force supermarkets to work harder to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to compete with Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores since it acquired these chains two years ago. It is believed that this has boosted food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a disagreement over how to split the income from the pharmacy counters in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of 281 pharmaceutical outlets of Sainsbury to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is said to be participating in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offering is designed to cater to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, was “furious” after the presenter of television Holly Willoughby broke an agreement worth £11 million with his lifestyle business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the fashion and accessories line Truly.
This business had compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the girl of gold on television admitted that her new deals, valued at up to £1.5 million, did not leave time for her Truly fashion and accessories brand.
The business had been compared to Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow and was being positioned as a favourite to double Willoughby &apos; s fortune of £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving the business, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented, "Holly truly had the highest priority of any of the girls."
It would be her long-term future, keeping her in the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved completely stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow, ready to be sold.
The exit of This Morning &apos; s most successful star could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly delay the launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby established Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were on vacation together and Jones owned 40 % of Baldwin &apos; s television production company.
Willoughby is to become the face of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that "no business topics were discussed" last night.
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump spoke in his mock-newsman voice.
“I have not given up anything.”
Kim is interested in meeting him again after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world's assembled leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country has not seen an "adequate" response from the United States to its first steps towards North Korea's denuclearization.
The United States, however, continued to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's speech was much more optimistic at his rally.
We get along great with North Korea, he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a fantastic relationship now.”
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of missile tests, help in freeing hostages and bringing home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It is very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we would have 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for international aid to be mobilized.
Mrs. Sumbung explains that "unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, which makes things a little more complicated."
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palu, it is still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations would be allowed to provide aid.
Given that Indonesia is a country that is constantly moving, it is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami sirens in Palu, even with a prior warning, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
Traveling from one island of Indonesia to another is a challenge at best.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the new disaster enclave.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia &apos; s worn-out infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who faces re-election next year.
It must also contend with the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim faith have adopted a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, equals the score for Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea &apos; s goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot and tapped it before kicking it at the second post.
The action sent it over the area and towards the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
Sturridge was trying to get into that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible.
I saw Kante coming and gave him a tap. I didn &apos; t think much about it, I just let it go.
Chelsea was winning 1-0 at half-time after Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' winger made a step-over pass to Mateo Kovacic before cutting inside and into the Liverpool box, before finishing with a low shot.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle.
After that, he made a nice pass to Hazard, who took him to the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished off the clearance with a left-footed volley that Liverpool &apos; s Alisson Becker could not stop.
Liverpool plays Napoli on Wednesday, 15:00, in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the country &apos; s disaster agency at the start of Sunday.
Many people were trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency &apos; s spokesman, told a press briefing.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect in a woman's stabbing death
An investigation into murder has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at Grayson Mews, on John Street, at 7:55 a.m. and a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in her murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, Birkenhead, and who saw or heard anything suspicious should contact us."
He would also recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found on a property.
Some people who believed they knew the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have informed the victim &apos; s family that they are in the process of informing them.
A taxi driver who lives at Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to find what had happened.
Residents are now being told that they will be allowed back in a few hours.
Someone overheard an agent telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was seen crying at the site.
He keeps repeating "it's terrible."
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several officers were standing guard inside the cordon, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information should contact Merseyside Police on 101, Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, log 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament Square becomes the latest commemorative success in "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious artefacts in England carried out by its puritanical fanatics.
The Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick &apos; s suggestions as &quot; nonsense &quot; and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from Westminster Palace would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, a century earlier.
The magnificent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema is a testament to the opinion of the nineteenth century and to the historiography of a figure many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, the monarchy."
If it is a completely accurate description, then the debate is far from over.
What is true is that the mid-seventeenth-century conflict has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of commemoration and celebration.
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a livestock dealer at a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He apparently travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that there was a big pig with blood on its mouth in the pit.
The autopsy confirmed that the pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
The legs of his cousin were bloodied and mangled, he said, and he was identified by his surname, Wu, in the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
A manager of the market told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, pigs attacking people is not unheard of.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilos cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it away.
After pigs ate a rancher in Oregon in 2012, a rancher in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "triggering mechanism."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What is needed is to give them the appropriate respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rain in the south-west of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the north Mexico coast.
Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa produced gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday morning (Eastern Standard Time) to 5 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) and was located about 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressure is starting to build in the Pacific, moving eastward toward the West Coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday, and a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rains northward, toward the Southwest United States.
Rosa is expected to leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical storm collides with the low pressure system that is approaching, widespread heavy precipitation will occur over the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible desert dust storms.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation rates of almost 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in Arizona.
Due to the nature of tropical rain, sudden and rapid flooding may occur.
Because of the threat of tropical thunderstorms, it is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms could cause local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching low-pressure system will bring heavy rains to specific parts of the southern California coast.
Heavy rains may leave as much as two inches of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
This would be the first heavy rains of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before becoming widespread by late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to the Quad Cities on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes will be observed in the United States as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
Sometimes, this means drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences will be seen across the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm October is expected, with temperatures generally in the mid-to-upper 20s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term outlook indicates above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony.
More than 20 million people followed the tearful testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest developments from Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had groped her while she was drunk and that he had tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 per cent sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people Nielsen mentioned on Friday may have seen it.
The company tallied the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels that carried it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen often has trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
For perspective, it is a crowd similar to that of an American football playoff or Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh, the network leader, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long appearance, Nielsen noted.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
Following the appearance, there was a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the morning of Friday, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
As he was being scolded, live on CNN, he looked dejected.
One woman said, "Looking me in the face."
“Do you believe him?”
He continued: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Flake said his office had issued a press release and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and broadcast television aired everything live hours later, when the Senate Judiciary Committee had to vote to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake &apos; s decision was critical, as it became clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
Theresa May, the British prime minister, accused her critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference to be held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside hers on the newspaper &apos; s front page, her former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to share customs duties was &quot; completely absurd &quot;.
Wayde murder: Simpson arrested as suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 bond has been set, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head that had entered the brain.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game during the last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "shocked" by the death of Wayde.
“These are the things that people always worry about,” Wade said.
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed signs of activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre recorded several tremors and shakes.
In social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, 72 km south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo," has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after anti-riot police clashed with pro-independence demonstrators as thousands of people took to the streets to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists who had been stopped by the riot police threw eggs and powder at the officers, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes later in the day and police used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans such as "Neither forget nor forgive," faced off against unionists, shouting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrated.
The voters chose independence by a landslide, although the turnout was low, as those who were against secession boycotted the referendum in large numbers.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, where there were violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped out Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The march continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would ever become independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite winning a narrow victory in the December regional elections, the procatalyst parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
“It is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament in the upcoming elections.
“Standing for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for crashing a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. on Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that the damage was done to the access and the building itself.
At some point, the car may have been shot with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston sealed the victory.
A Livingston promoted impressed Rangers at securing Steven Gerrard's second win as manager of Ibrox in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference. Gary Holt's team went up a notch, with Hibs in second place.
This season, Gerrard have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, the league leaders with an eight-point lead.
The Rangers play Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
While Livingston extended his winning streak to six games, Holt, the team &apos; s head coach, still hasn &apos; t tasted defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses a chance to make a big play against a tough opponent
The Holt team had to have been a step ahead much earlier, causing all kinds of problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence, but failed to score from close range in front of goal. Alan Lithgow then hit the post after a Craig Halkett header was saved by the keeper.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their dead-ball play.
That was the decisive blow.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston tried to find an opening, with a combined play from Declan Gallagher and Robinson to Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the middle of the area.
At that point, the Rangers were in control of the ball, but they were unable to get past the host goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, who was quite calm.
That game continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stoppage.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers &apos; goalkeeper, blocked a shot by Scott Pittman with a kick, and Livingston was unable to get another shot off.
There were long passes into the Livingston area constantly, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one after Halkett's shot on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a hand.
Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The consensus is that they played a great game that exceeded expectations of an upward trajectory.
His style of play and his roster have hardly changed since his ascension, but that is largely due to Holt, who has strengthened the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was huge and led a well-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good moments with Gerrard, they came up short.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to penetrate the opposition's field once, which is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
Smiles and blue skies were in evidence at the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin on Saturday, September 29.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey &apos; s EU membership.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police cited security reasons for preventing 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also condemned both his policies and the German government &apos; s decision to welcome him to the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by the paramedics, but he died on the spot.
The accident occurred after another cyclist was killed after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene on Childers Street, about two kilometres from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured after disturbances
Six prison officials were injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison directorate.
The disturbances began at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 9.30 a.m. on Sunday and are still continuing.
A team of elite specialists (called "Tornado") is in charge of controlling the disturbances, in which eight inmates are involved and which affect one wing.
The agents received minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman commented: "Specialist prison staff have been deployed to deal with the current incident at HMP Long Lartin."
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.”
Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital care after a prisoner had attacked him.
In October last year, prison guards called for backup after a serious disturbance in which inmates attacked prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen early next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep through the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern Nevada and eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of torrential rain, which can reach 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 inches, with the possibility of up to 10 inches in isolated areas in the southwest desert, including the Rockies and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rains are considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains may be beneficial due to the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa, which is expected to be a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 136 mph (219 km/h) by Sunday morning, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm is running into cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
As such, it is expected to hit Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
Heavy rains of between 7 and 15 inches are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 inches, as reported by weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border by early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then move southward into Utah by late Tuesday night.
The main danger of Rosa or its remains is the torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and southwest United States.
These rains are expected to cause sudden flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Four arrested for attempted murder in Midsomer Norton
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects in an attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, at about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he is &quot; stable &quot;.
Four 17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to the Avon and Somerset Police.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh &quot; suffered the meanness and anger &quot; of the Democratic Party.
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the vicious and disgusting tactics of the Democrat Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers, testifying emotionally and forcefully.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, "Americans saw the shrewdness, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most successful legalists of our time, a lawyer with an admirable record of public service,” he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to the Kavanaugh nomination in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not running, but I am definitely in the race," he said.
“That is why I go from one place to another, fighting for big candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
A key procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to a senior Republican official in the White House.
Hundreds of dead in a quake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday to celebrate a festival when waves as high as six metres came in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When yesterday it was announced that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, in Indonesian) in Jakarta, at a press conference.
The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, everything on land, it was a disaster that had travelled at 800 km/h across the open sea before hitting the coast.
He added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The city was still being pummeled by the storm on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in a region with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT, in Indonesian) reported in a press release that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which is built on the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "serious" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency came under fire on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the agency's officials say the waves had already reached the coast by the time the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard warning people on the street below that a tsunami is approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout in the area around Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened for relief and rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centres in Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
That is very bad.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala had arrived safely in Palu, where staff were sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they had seen a devastating scene on their way, he said.
He said he had seen many houses destroyed.
That is very bad.
While the aid groups were putting the machinery of disaster assistance into motion, some people were complaining that the movement of experienced relief workers to Palu was being blocked.
Under Indonesian regulations, only foreign funding, supplies and personnel can be used if the site is declared a national disaster area.
And that has not yet happened.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares it a national disaster, we can start international aid, but it has not happened yet.”
Friends and relatives of the missing people still hoping for a miracle to bring some light to the stories of natural disasters still had hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the stories of natural disasters.
A small child was rescued from a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, a parapente instructor for the Indonesian national team, had trained two of the missing parapenters for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“My own emotional baggage is part of my parapente experience,” he said.
Mr. Gendon remembered how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, their messages only showed a grey verification mark, not two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves made off with $26,750 during a cash-out at a Newport on the Levee ATM.
On Friday morning, two robbers robbed a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM machine located in the entertainment district and was preparing to reload it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running up behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money intended for reloading.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will now be known as Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time now, a name he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album, Yandhi.
The singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance due to "emotional reasons," as the creator of the show commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
West said he believed it was the most used word in the Bible, meaning "you."
You are me, I am you means we are one.
Kanye became Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without a hyphen.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico &apos; s newly elected president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Square that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing them with monthly stipends for those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I. A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow recent announcements by several parts of the United States Government, even when, in general, the United States lacks an official I. A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in IA by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I. A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging far behind the United States in this area,” says Lee.
The double funding means twice the chances of the next great breakthrough in I. A. being achieved in the U. S., as Lee declared in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book &quot; AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order &quot; was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China &apos; s most important I. A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed a system of I. A. that defeated the best American player of Othello. He later worked at Microsoft Research and was president of Google China.
He acknowledged the previous technological competitions of the United States Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It is not China that is taking the academic leaders; it is the corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent academics to work on I. A.
Lee commented that changes in US immigration policy could also help intensify US efforts in I. A.
I. A. doctors should be given automatic permanent residency cards, he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In early 2001, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from industry and academia. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 million a year in research on I. A.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation that attempted to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change their name.
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name will change to "Republic of Macedonia North," a move that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, the majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50 % required to make the referendum valid.
The referendum ballot asked: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
“I have come here today to vote for the future of Macedonia, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopie.
Although not legally binding, many members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote so that it will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission declared at 1 p.m. that no irregularities had been reported.
However, the turnout was only 16 % compared to 34 % of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I came here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in Skopie.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on changing the name of the country, which would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and removing chairs from the tents set up by those who were boycotting the referendum.
Kavadarkov said, "We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door."
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that joining NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, whose unemployment rate is over 20 per cent.
Zaev said that he believed that the majority would be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of citizens were in favour of the EU and NATO.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future."
A poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Studies claimed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which would be lower than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57 per cent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, evades the entire Brighton defence to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a yellow card in the first few minutes of the match.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking into open play.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded one defender before outrunning several more in the Brighton area.
He made a left turn onto Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit it with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan in goal with a shot that hit the right post.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguero had some problems with his foot.
We were talking about 55 to 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky to score at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave Manchester City the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton goal.
He made a nice pass to Leroy Sane on the left flank.
Sane gave Sterling a few pointers before sending him to the second pole.
The Sky Blues forward fired the ball just outside the offside line.
City faces Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies &apos; party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, still have playoff chances.
The Rockies at least secured one wildcard spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can go into the game with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and that the other team probably played at the highest level I have faced this year.
Why wouldn &apos; t you want to participate?
The Nationals still have to announce a closer for Sunday, but it looks like they are leaning toward leaving Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th appearance, had a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.

Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation, his selection to the Supreme Court, when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
In November, everything we have done is at stake.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I am not standing, but I am fighting for good candidates, so I go from one place to another.
He continued: "We have a terrible radical group of Democrats, and they are in power right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, and the meanness, the evil.
They don &apos; t care who they hurt or step on to get power and control, that &apos; s what they want, power and control, and we &apos; re not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, were engaged in a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
“We have seen it these last four days,” he said, saying that the Democrats “were furious, were bad, were horrible and were false.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by nominating Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I hope you have an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.”
The Labour Party is a broad church.
He is intolerant of people who speak their minds.
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last Labour MP to be told that I am not welcome, and only for saying what I think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censure motion criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He was at odds with a responsible economic policy, on national security, for Europe. It was ironic that he was at odds with leaders on issues on which he had disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more compassionate and kind" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever was implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether or not the party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to radically change his mind and adopt positions with which he had never been comfortable, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the centre &apos; s policies, saying I shouldn &apos; t be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced it.
Indeed, I am aware that my colleagues tend to be more political in their comments on me.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist insults, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have such a wide range of opinions and, with every "censorship" motion or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice to keep my head down and not make a fuss, so that I would be "all right."
I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a schoolboy, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my political views, and I certainly did not do so in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday that I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, be they Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will stop me from acting in what I believe to be best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr invincible at the top
Two late tries may have decided the final outcome, but without doubt Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten that are participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make the most of opportunities, that gave the local team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
“We have been tested in every game and we have come out victorious, so I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, commented: "Ayr deserves the recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson &apos; s try at the 14th minute was converted by Frazier Climo, but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, on loan to the Warriors from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opposition and Jason Baggot converted a penalty not converted.
Climax extended its lead with a penalty kick just before halftime, scoring and converting a solo try, which left the score at 17-5 in favour of the Ayr.
However, the Melrose started well and Patrick Anderson &apos; s essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
There was a long stoppage after a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be stretchered off, and Ayr went ahead with a Stafford McDowall try converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having one more man with a non-converted Bruce Colvin, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the locals recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for not having the ball in hand when he was in the line of scrimmage, MacPherson made a try from behind the maul that was advancing.
As he had done almost since the game resumed, Kyle Rowe kicked the ball back to David Armstrong, who then passed it to Gregor Henry, who scored the fifth goal for the locals.
The Still Game star wants to move into the restoration business
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, appears determined to move into the catering business after it was revealed that he had been appointed manager of a chain of restaurants.
The actor, 56, is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC programme, which he writes and co-stars in with his comedy partner of many years, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source at the Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming Glasgow restoration market."
“The sea is ours”: a landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the Pacific route
Naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying outside public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
“It is our duty to recover it.”
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, people still vividly remember the lost coast to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the nineteenth century, as well as the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Bolivia is hoping for a resolution from the International Court of Justice by October 1, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and calm, and, of course, is waiting for the results with a positive vision, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has an obligation to negotiate for Bolivia to gain sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is embroiled in a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about Monday &apos; s resolution.
In late August, he promised that they were "very close to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia &apos; s favour and that the situation would not change much if it did.
The UN agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice issued its ruling only six months after the final submissions indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Chilean expert Paz Zárate, in international law.
Far from helping Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
The problem of access to the sea had been seized by the current Bolivian administration, Zárate said.
He also suggested that Morales &apos; s bellicose rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talking at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to keep the conversation going after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and to put an end to 139 years of mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
Bolivia would never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The resolution is an opportunity to see what we need to leave behind.
North Korea says it will not give up nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to give up nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when Mike Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy talks that have been stalled for more than three months since this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
He said that the continuation of the ongoing sanctions and the United States &apos; opposition to a declaration that would end the Korean War and bring North Korea to its knees was a &quot; chimera &quot;.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration without some meaningful disarmament movement from Pyongyang first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang &apos; s disarmament, which the country probably regards as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The latest line of enormous hats is about to land on a street of shops near you.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the runway.
Valentino &apos; s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large items included pineapples, a wizard hat and even a coconut, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of wild masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn lips and recalled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled a full diving team, complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big clothes, you are in luck.
The big hat trend is predicted to start appearing on the streets of shops.
Big hats are back in a big way, with a straw hat with a 60-centimetre brim worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand also presented another great creation on the runway: a beach bag as big as the one the model was wearing.
The orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at the Paris Fashion Week.
As fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: &quot;Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on the streets of the high street. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for large accessories.&quot;
John Edward: linguistic skills are vital for citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the exams, which is further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these independent schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for short), are striving to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they will occupy in the world.
As a modern language, it is observed that modern languages are still popular and in demand in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart."
If you talk to him in his language, it reaches his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you can &apos; t rely solely on English.
If we look at the recent results of the examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
Overall, 68 per cent of the students who studied foreign languages received an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centres that make up the SCIS, showed that 72 % of students achieved an A in Mandarin, while 72 % of those studying German, 69 % of those studying French and 63 % of those studying Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that children and young people will need in the future without a doubt.
Languages are now considered on a par with the CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere else.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17 per cent of employers cited language skills as a barrier to filling jobs.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly indispensable for preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential for language skills in the workplace is increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whether someone chooses to pursue a career or learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to this competition, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give that person an edge over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and it was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 per cent, was French.
For this reason, learning languages is now important for today &apos; s children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, they will be better equipped to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the more important languages for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child &apos; s interests, independent schools will always offer a choice of several languages taught by specialist staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
In a global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages are "competencies for international communication."
Independent schools in Scotland will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people.
Fair enough.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron James makes his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for LeBron James to make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes he will play is still to be determined.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton commented on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers &apos; six-game preseason schedule.
At this stage of his career, he said, he did not need to play any spring training games.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump campaign rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court in the run-up to the midterm elections, Trump is seeking support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. this Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live YouTube feed.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual misconduct and has left the Senate waiting for a vote of confirmation for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
The main purpose of these rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections to gain momentum.
The Trump campaign noted that the five rallies next week are intended to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House," according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while campaigning, a Trump campaign aide told Reuters, who declined to be named.
The rally tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage from Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has to come to his rescue in the polls, Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows that it is willing to fight to keep the flame of hope alive heading into the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
So where is the impetus now?
Jordan Spieth, who finished the day with a six-shot lead, said, "We were six shots ahead and now we're four shots ahead, so I guess that's a little bit of a push."
Europe has a clear advantage: four points ahead with 12 more to play for.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel they have something of a wind in their sails and plenty of reasons to be cheerful, among other reasons, the pair of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and managed three points each.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee and preaches with his example.
The guttural yells of celebration rose in volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt for Thomas and him to tie the fourth round when they were two down with two to play.
The putt that the team gave them on the 15 was received with a similar cry, one that said that the American team had not yet been knocked out.
Spieth said, "What we need to do is redouble our efforts and focus on the game."
That is what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable couple from Europe are four for four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only pair that did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes of Friday morning.
This run and the way their energy flows with the noisy crowd on Sunday make it clear that these are the players to beat, and there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, two holes, one for each.
However, it is still premature to talk of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two birdies on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
There will be no help to get out of the holes on Sunday.
The foursomes and fourballs are fascinating to watch up close because of the interplay between the couples, the advice they give and do not give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team is willing to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good lead going into the final day of the Ryder Cup, after winning the foursomes and fourballs 10-6 over the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two wins over Tiger Woods, who was in trouble, gaining four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a United States team that made many errors during the foursomes in the morning, which ended 3-1.
The United States fought back in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points. He and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership helped to beat a dejected Woods and the American rookie Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who had not been a standout in either of the two parties on Saturday, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world 1 and 3 players respectively, 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in southwest Paris, Europe was not having all its own way.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas served as a reference for the Americans, who earned two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has ever recovered from a four-point deficit in the individual matches, but Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second-best team for two days, it seems that a comeback on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is "no possibility" of unilateral disarmament if it does not have confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his country &apos; s mistrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country &apos; s unilateral nuclear disarmament under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly at its annual meeting that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received any similar response from the United States," he said.
If we do not trust the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and in those circumstances, there is no possibility of our unilateral disarmament.
Although Ri repeated the familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps toward disarmament, his statement is important, as it does not reject unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an American president in office and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working for &quot; denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula &quot; and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can be officially declared at peace.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States had insisted on nuclear disarmament first and had increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a statement of war termination, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of any plans for a second Trump-Kim summit, announced with great fanfare by the US leader at the United Nations at the start of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, in the past five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party interested in nuclear disarmament instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri's tone was radically different from last year's speech to the UN General Assembly, when he said that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles to American soil after "madman" Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim "rocket man."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to &quot; totally destroy &quot; North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in moving towards disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and that sanctions should continue to be applied until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its advances.
As US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize a complete and verifiable denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang &apos; s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but North Korea later denounced his "demands as those of a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantling a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States &quot; took corresponding measures &quot;.
He said that Kim had told him that the "measures" he was seeking were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to sleep enough.
Thanks to a new course being offered this year at Harvard University, all university students are now sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of all-night caffeine-fuelled cramming.
A professor at the world &apos; s number one university discovered that students there often had no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was just hearing about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever told him the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos; s health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, athletic shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a routine for going to bed.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that changing student behaviour will not happen overnight.
We believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of "all-nighters" still existed and added that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good night's sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
He hopes the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar programme of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler &apos; s recommendation is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by computer screens and LED lights, which can disrupt circadian rhythms, so they will have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal sinks Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression away from home, when the Dolly Menga attack saw Steven Gerrard &apos; s disjointed team lose 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to secure their first away win since February 4-1 against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's team for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga's attack came just minutes before half-time and Rangers' poor alignment was not up to the mark at any point.
Now, the Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston up to third, behind Hibernian by the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after allegedly being hit by an object from the visiting side.
Gerrard changed eight of the eight winners of the match against Ayr, qualifying for the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt took the 11 Livingston players who beat Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-drilled team dominated their opponents throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when he had it.
They should have marked the two minutes to go when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman that went between the defence, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs was penalized for a foul on Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, could only send it out of bounds.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their chances in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had been fouled in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian appeals.
The Rangers scored twice in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly barely had to break sweat to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame lob.
Although Livingston &apos; s goal in the 34th minute was against the odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a deep pass from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to score.
In the stoppage, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, who had an almost immediate impact, as Morelos took over the line and Kelly stepped out of his lane to block him.
Livingston continued to lead the visitors exactly to the type of game he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing a long pass after long pass.
Holt could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow got a head of steam and took the corner.
The Rangers substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty late in the game after a run-in with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of &quot; Sunday Morning &quot;, 30 September 1882, and counting... 136 years ago, and BORN TODAY... was the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm &quot; Hans &quot; Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film &quot; The Big Country &quot;, with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, at the age of 63.
The invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can &quot; see &quot; a common protein in many cancers and re-inject it.
A vaccine trial is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can &quot; see &quot; a common protein called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes growth of different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West went on a rant in favour of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It did not work out.
Kanye West was booed at the Saturday Night Live studio after a performance that was erratic, with the rapper praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I talk to white people all the time and they ask me how I can like Trump, who is racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch of Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock posted the rant on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
West also told the audience that he had had a bad time backstage because he was wearing the hat.
They messed with me.
I was told not to wear my hat.
They got me!
And then they tell me I am asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see me asleep?" and added that he was "going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to advance?"
Try with love.”
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety, which reported that one person told the magazine: "The study was completely shut down."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died recently.
West shocked many when he came out on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
I decide not to reward someone (buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I think is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We also do,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the legendary musician Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those screen roles often told young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something went wrong" and questioned how to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he thinks "it's kind of important" to address this issue.
“Personally, I think it is quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?”, he said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they now face?”
Kit believes that television may have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young men feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any spin-offs or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he has taken away from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, I have given my future family and life from now on,” he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of these were sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
The number of people contracting HIV in this way has been reduced to a mere handful, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community faces much discrimination.
Because of the country &apos; s conservative values, studies have calculated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data on Republican senators and calls the allegations "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three United States Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were being pushed by commentators and right-wing websites.
Waters commented on Twitter: "Lies, lies and more lies."
The information published reportedly included the addresses and phone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office, and the Capitol reported the data of a Waters staff member.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a total lie, said Waters.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a complete lie.”
Waters &apos; statement was immediately met with criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote, "I am writing to dispute this information with anger."
This suggests that the necessary temperance for membership in Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
Do not rebel.
The accuser should not be questioned.
He must remain calm and serene.
It appears that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the Kavanaugh hearing to the Democrats' criticisms of Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is challenging Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If true, that is very serious, he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations."
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against my staff,” he said.
Johnny English: Again in Action. Rowan Atkinson's spoof spy is a bit tame
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new British-themed film. This is what seems to be the right thing to do with this new Johnny English parody action and comedy franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satire about how clearly bonkers we are be the new export opportunity for the nation?
Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and blank face, has renewed his licence to make a fool of himself for the second time. His name alone gives clues that he is a comic creation aimed at territories where English is not the first language.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent, despite its odd claims of glamour, who has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that type who hit a single note on the subject of Cars of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious man traveller and international figure represented years ago by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television adverts, causing chaos in his wake.
There are a couple of good moments in this last one.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter in full medieval armour as the rotors hit the hull.
Atkinson &apos; s gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humour is disappointingly thin and superfluous, especially now that franchises like 007 and Mission: Impossible add comic ingredients without a hitch.
The humour seems more aimed at children than adults, and for me, the absurd mishaps of Johnny English are not as clever and well-timed as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
The current argument of the day is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated Britain &apos; s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent in the field, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
The first minister is a pompous and cornered figure who is seeing her popularity in politics sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this role, which is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That would be Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, although he also gives informal lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy like the one in Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets his old pal Bough, now represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submariner captain, a role he doesn &apos; t exploit enough with Vicki Pepperdine.
Batman and Robin, who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service, are back in action, with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic multi-millionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain &apos; s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they dress up as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; and English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
The last sequence was definitely well-executed, but the whole thing still has a rather childish feel to it.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn &apos; t help wondering whether the British film industry couldn &apos; t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan to make Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan whereby Britons would work four days a week, but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the owners of AI companies to donate the savings from the AI revolution to the workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
The idea "fits" with the party's plans and economic agenda, and would tilt the country towards the working class.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: A revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
The four-day week is a definite goal for the party, but one that it hopes to achieve in the longer term, as part of its overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, not all Labour MPs are in favour of this decision.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not party policy and will not be discussed at this time."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "well-connected" companies that provided public services.
One of the shadow minister &apos; s plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders in water companies should not get back all their shares, as a Labour government might apply deductions to cover the irregularities detected.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10 per cent of shares in private companies would be allocated to employees, with annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh on 60 Minutes and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has at least delayed by a week the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court judge, and raises the question of whether the results could influence any Republican senator who might ultimately decide to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could produce information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, unyielding.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be immovable.
I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it flatly," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people she named could confirm it.
It has been 36 years.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive roster of stars in support of an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
This year, the seventh edition of the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free entry to the event (unless they can afford a VIP ticket), concert-goers have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions," such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity that helps raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
What has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of "clicktivism," which is the term we use when we think we are doing something really useful by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favour of a wide range of goals.
Through these actions, they claim to have secured commitments and policies worth over US$37 billion, which will impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had cited 390 commitments and announcements that had emerged from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had been disbursed or pledged.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly impacted almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition," a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom united by a common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential." To this end, $35 million has been proposed to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
Thanks to the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens partners like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition," to the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claimed that, after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions asked on our website about what we think can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and hard road, and we will stumble and fall many times.
As we have already achieved our goals in the movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the acts we will have at the New York event this year, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out the energy export embargo on Russia - Department of the Interior
In case of need, Washington could call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up the markets, including the Middle East, according to US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is just a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier of Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official reports, there are ways and means of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, in extreme cases, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the consumer voice in energy policy in the United States."
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to exploit and replace fossil fuels, he warned, adding that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made as the Trump administration has been trying to push liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including the President himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted throughout that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, worth $11 billion and intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington &apos; s fierce opposition to the project is only economic in nature and is yet another example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The United States position has, however, been met with resistance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry organization that leads the industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a major problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider a run for the presidency in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a hearing at the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women in leadership, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider running for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a speech at City Hall and said he was "taking the country down the wrong path."
"I really worry about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke openly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "It is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
However, a majority of Warren voters themselves do not believe he should run for office in 2020.
A 58 per cent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said Senator Kerry should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
However, 32 per cent of those surveyed supported her candidature.
In the survey, former Governor Deval Patrick received more support than a possible candidacy, with 38 per cent of respondents in favour and 48 per cent against.
Other Democratic Party members spoke about the possible candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the 2020 presidential election.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin &apos; s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
The situation my son is going through, everything that has happened since he returned, is very well known to the other families who are suffering from the effects of TEPT and other wounds suffered by our soldiers," she said to the crowd gathered at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this as the great taboo nobody wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other veterans of war that "they come home with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to their country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on a domestic violence charge that interfered with a domestic violence complaint and possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to develop a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit against the new US policy that denies asylum to domestic violence and gang victims.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a "friendly" letter to Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum-seeker who is currently facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" that was filed by the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.
He said that his partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but US officials denied his asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum requests to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA, for its acronym in English) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum in this country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine made statements on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum applications must be denied on the facts and circumstances of the particular claim and this exception violates that principle," the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also noted in the brief that the policy denying entry to immigrants harms the US economy by asserting that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide a necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to domestic violence and gang violence victims in June.
Individuals who leave their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion may apply for asylum, Sessions said when he announced this directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a panacea for all the problems, let alone all the serious problems, that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, was trying to comfort her feverish baby at a relief centre in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for the few belongings they have left in an effort to salvage what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded; including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuing aftershocks, which were also very strong.
He could not help but cry as he told us about the violent earthquake he had lived through while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to get out of the way.
I got stuck in the rubble, Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I don &apos; t know what has happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper promoting mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China was published by a Chinese official newspaper, the United States ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely read newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, something China denies vehemently.
The accusation that Beijing tried to influence the US elections marked a new phase in a growing US campaign to pressure China, according to US officials cited by Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led to both sides raising tariff levels on imports from each other.
The Chinese counter-tariffs that were in place at the beginning of the trade war were designed to fall on exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and business people.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China &quot; is intensifying that pressure with advertisements in our free press."
In an effort to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press to try to place an advertisement in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, in the newsstand on the street where we are in Beijing, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China may have about the troubling trajectory that their economy is on, as the media are controlled by the Communist Party of China.
He added that "one of China &apos; s most important newspapers had declined to publish his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are rallying behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially among women, could occur in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been intense, and many Republicans have said they want to move forward with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday that &quot; it is not possible to go back &quot; on such matters.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake &apos; s (R-Arizona) last attempt to position himself in favour of the FBI &apos; s investigation would be enough to calm disgruntled voters on this issue.
Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered outside the Senate chanted "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) as the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by the Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is way beyond any prediction," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
People say that the impact is already very significant, and indeed it is.
But it could be even greater, especially among indecisive women from the outer boroughs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote even though they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had indicated that a reversal could occur if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News early last week.
"It is not just a question of the committee vote and the final vote, or even whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench; it is also how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know whom to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, although a few more are siding with Kavanaugh.
In a new YouGov poll, 41 per cent of respondents said they believed Ford &apos; s testimony definitively or probably, while 35 per cent said they believed Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30 per cent said the same of Ford.
After the shove by Flake, the FBI is now investigating Ford &apos; s statements, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while she was drunk at age 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend. A company based on the open-source Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "to rule the world."
"It has to be now," he said about the startup.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may contain to-do lists, task lists, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser, at the same time.
One thing that is unique to online personal data storage is that the user is completely in control of who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal data training."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's chief executive officer, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach the world.
For now, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers on staff working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, tech developers around the world could build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team was not talking to Facebook and Google about whether a radical change was going to be introduced or not, where all their business models were going to be completely changed overnight.
We are not going to ask for permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt, "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate over the neutrality of the Internet.
Even though Berners-Lee is launching Inrupt, he will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added, "I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web."
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only English clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this medal on 29 September 1918 at the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, their two grandchildren found a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "a very symbolic find" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under intense machine-gun and artillery fire."
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery," advanced the line before reaching a ravine with one hand and knocking down three of the enemy.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather &apos; s actions were &quot; so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very instructive.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade and added that the value of a true hero was evident when he was shown such a large turnout.
MMA fans stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 only to miss the main event.
The San Jose billboard had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was going to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom at night.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face off, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a big joke."
There is government regulation of what can be broadcast after 6 a.m., and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when we asked him about the broadcast.
""Peppa the Pig", yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would be changing the format to include British viewers in future editions.
When I think about the option of a re-broadcast, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it is at 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, we received a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because we initially thought it was a technical problem.
But it was a government problem.
I can promise you that it will not happen again.
We reduced it to five fights instead of six, which is our usual number, in order to give the fans more than usual and we were happy with ourselves.
That is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but that was what motivated him to become a champion.
At 24, she told us that she did not realize that "not everyone was like me" until she went to secondary school.
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in talking about gay rights was to "transmit hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to lose interest in winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this legendary show, Kirsty Young, is going to be off for a few months due to illness.
In the first Laverne &amp; Shirley, Daley, who was shown as a social outcast, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the gang during his childhood, because "society did not accept that you liked boys and girls."
He said: "The feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, and he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent face of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told his story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisal, and wanted to pass on that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, was a big surprise.
Daley married last year to an Oscar winner who is 20 years older, though he said that the age difference has never been a problem.
When you live so long from such a young age (she was at her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone your own age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "global perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all the answers would have been about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
But there are more important things than gold Olympic medals.
My gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie."
His son is named Robert, after his father, Robert, who died at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and in fact one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I was unable to tell him that I would not be able to be in the first row.
She said, "He had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it was only then that I realized that he was not invincible."
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
I knew then that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better," he said.
This was also the inspiration behind her first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied her during the preparation for the Olympic Games. She still gets goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, sat on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad footnote.
Mickelson, who was playing in the event every two years to break his record for the 12th time, was beaten by captain Furyk in the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time major champion had to settle for cheering at times and, at others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what ails him.
The most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form on the long rough at Le Golf National, where the long rough constantly punishes errant shots.
And if the field is not sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth round of the tournament on Sunday, faces the brilliant Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutante Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four shots down after the first 12 individual matches, had started off in such an impressive fashion, Mickelson &apos; s match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, but could say little more.
Furyk said he understood the role he had to play today, he gave me a pat on the back and said he would be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably wasn &apos; t imagining playing two games.
He thought there would be more, but that is how it turned out and how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass the mark of Nick Faldo for most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a Ryder Cup career that had never been so clearly defined by his individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He is "fun, sarcastic, clever, likes to mock others; he is a great guy to have on the team," he explained.
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as a support this week; it was fun.
It is much more than just a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although he has a substantial lead in the last few days of the Ryder Cup, he can easily turn it into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a Seve Ballesteros-led American team held a five-point lead over the Danes, but in the end they only managed to tie the other team by the narrowest of margins, 14½-13½.
Bjorn, who was pictured after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead by 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National, said, "We won a great tournament at Valderrama, we won a great tournament at Brookline and we lost, we won a great tournament at Valderrama and we lost by a whisker, but we won at Valderrama and we lost by a whisker."
History will teach us and everyone else that this team is not finished.
You have to give it your all tomorrow.
Get out of here and do what you have to do.
It does not stop until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, and that is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on our 12 players, but we are very aware of what is on the other side, where there are the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players had done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual performance and that is different.
It is great to share the good news with a buddy when things are going well, but when things are not going well, you really put your golfing skills to the test.
That is the message that needs to be sent to the players, to give their best tomorrow.
Now it is time to leave your partner behind and go and get the best out of yourself.
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to play better individually than they did as a pair, with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas adding three points on four.
Furyk has been on both ends of these great tournaments in the last few days and was part of the winning team at Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
He remembered every word, we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had motivated his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-imports tomorrow, but we have to play as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the field.
Bjorn explained his choices as follows: "I chose these guys in this order because I think they cover the whole trip."
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to faulty systems and the increasing costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed now until the first half of 2019, according to a statement by Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the handover scuttled the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures that are very low.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, allowing deployment up to two years away from the home port.
The delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the oceans) will be already out of date by the time they start service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was officially decommissioned last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the ship and returned it to Blohm &amp; Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "critical software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors: half the crew that had been on the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy &apos; s ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including training the crew, has also been a problem.
It is now estimated to be worth 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion), up from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that are being attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction in the naval power of Germany.
In early 2007, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was "running short of ships capable of deploying."
The official said the problem had been getting worse over time, because old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new research, carried out in a Scottish Highlands county, is trying to find out how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything that is learned will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton's bat and brown long-eared bat from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special bat detectors will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track bat activity during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The experts will analyse the sounds picked up in the recordings to determine the frequency of the calls of the bats and the species that make them.
A report and map of the habitat will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affects their nests and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical cabling can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Mosquitoes are not actually blind.
Unless they are nocturnal hunters, their ears are more useful than their eyes in achieving their goal.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocation to locate ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTSA, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescues.
The organization has even opened the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
Here at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and the right habitat.
However, there is still much to be learned about bats, and the work we do here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before maintenance work is carried out, as a colony of bats can be accidentally destroyed and 400 females and young can be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species about which we know little about their population dynamics."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations as "fake news," and says that people are "trying to get their names in the papers" at his expense.
His lawyers have instructed him to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the statements.
The forward for Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying $375,000 to keep the incident quiet, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already garnered 142 million followers just hours after the news broke, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," he said, looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but I can't help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," he added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they have called "an unacceptable report on privacy suspicions," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, the lawyer for the player, said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
According to reports, the alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player &apos; s room and there, according to the documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo allegedly raped Mayorga anally.
Mayorga said that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good boy" and that he had let him down "one per cent" in the end.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of the wounds at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "humiliated in public."
The woman, 34, says she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a big Italian football club on a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: the UK will always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if we lost our global lead in car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disconcerting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
Mr. Clark said, "We need an agreement."
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of any delays at the border in the case of a Brexit without a deal could result in the loss of jobs.
Burnaston, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 per cent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production shortfalls in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the general manager of Toyota Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have voiced their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers are the problems that could arise in the supply chains in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on the just-in-time (JIT) method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU to be assembled into cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, there could be a disruption at the border, which, according to the sector, could result in delays and shortages.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to store the equivalent of more than a day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May &apos; s Chequers plan, which sets out the future relationship with the EU, was &quot; calibrated precisely to avoid these checks at the border &quot;.
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will not only see us through this moment but will take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
Toyota and other manufacturers have evidence that we can continue with what, until now, has been a tremendously successful supply chain.
Toyota has not been able to say how long the production will be halted, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union rep at the plant, said his members were increasingly concerned: "From my experience, once those jobs are lost, they are never recovered."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a clear and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed another week," as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, connections between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus compromise the independence of Mueller, has fueled gossip in Washington for months.
In early May, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein secretly recorded his conversations with Trump and wore a microphone to try to get him impeached under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
However, on Monday he went to the White House, where he was reported to be on the verge of resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the full Senate vote.
Trump &apos; s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the spot and I will inform the press as usual.
Some journalists would dispute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the lack of press coverage was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who acted grandiloquently, although he said, "I wouldn't disagree with the fact that they do."
She suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president holds more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him, he said, citing unverified numbers: "We have compared those numbers."
The press briefings will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly the President of the United States, I think that is much better than asking me.
We have tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press briefings with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why he was so popular, where he made an uncharacteristically casual and, at times, bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish Government writes to EU staff in NHS Scotland about their fears over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the staff of the EU HHS in Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and its wish to continue working with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens working in non-central government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
The United Kingdom government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know this must be very confusing for you.
And it is for this reason that I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
EU and other professionals bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to have you as part of our team."
Christion Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head wound.
Christion Abercrombie, a player on the Tennessee State Tigers, was taken to the hospital for emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday, when the Tigers lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
Reed said, "He came to the band and collapsed right there."
Both the trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A member of the staff at the Tennessee State Department told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left Vanderbilt Medical Center after the operation.
Harris added that "there were no details yet on the type of injury or damage" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding a total of 18 tackles for the season.
Foreigners will pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to house the homeless, according to new plans by the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in land transfer tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year, which will be used to help the homeless.
The additional money raised from the increase in stamp duty on foreign buyers of property in the United Kingdom will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises of providing more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in land transfer tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivize government policy to combat street begging.
The surcharge, which is an addition to the current stamp duty, also includes the increase in rates two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, which could reach up to 3 per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
13 per cent of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which is causing prices to rise and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder.
Many of the country &apos; s wealthiest areas (especially the capital) have become &quot; ghost towns &quot; due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping property prices artificially high by buying land without any intention of using it and urged Mrs May to scrap the affordable housing levies that were applied to affordable homes to solve the "shocking housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a very attractive series of reforms for housing, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
He also proposes giving local authorities more power to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my term as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life chances of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
It is not right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, should be able to buy houses more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of sleeping on the streets is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become a Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the prospect of reviving the club in the north-east, which at present occupies third place in League One (the third tier of English football), three points behind the top team.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after helping St. Mirren regain Premier League status last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only managed to get a B cap", he told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father, and it has always been something that has made me want to go back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I can successfully run a club."
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when moving to such established names in a club as big as this, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, my success is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club are, without doubt, those of the Premier League," he said.
It is not easy to achieve, but I would consider that I have achieved my goal here only when I can return the club to the club where it belongs.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint in the Hearts technical department.
After helping Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and helping St. Mirren avoid relegation the following season, he was named manager of the year.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled his time at Alloa with fondness, saying, "It was probably a real crossroads."
I always thought that coaching was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, but I was good at it, I made a living from it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure from this work, but I feel good in my direction.
I always wanted to train and now I have, it is the time of my adult life when I have felt better, without a doubt."
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Monday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the best time to have a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The heat wave of the summer has boosted sales at British pubs that are struggling to survive, but all the pressure has been on the chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell 4.8 per cent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA Consulting, which compiled the figures, said: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have kept the pattern of June, when pubs increased 2.8 per cent of their takings, while restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8 per cent drop in restaurant sales in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly alcoholic drinks had their best month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced their profits.
The pubs that serve mainly food also suffered, although not as drastically as restaurant operators.
People just want to go out and drink.
Sales of drinks in managed bars and pubs rose 6.6 per cent during the month, while sales of meals fell 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, the leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the home-based leisure market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8 per cent drop in sales compared with last year is going to be especially painful given the continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant industry and time will tell if the cooler temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, rose 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, data is collected and analysed from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £900 million and is the market benchmark.

The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, the head of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the urge to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland &apos; s most decorated athlete on track and field and President Ian Beattie described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim that sport benefits from its great international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish athletics community, the United Kingdom and the world at large, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from her involvement in its leadership," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics between the four gold medals he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack, which left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I recovered fully, I had to learn to walk again and I am now doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your messages and words of encouragement!
The announcement of the breast pump that compares mothers to cows has divided opinion on the Internet.
A breast-milk-pumping company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares mothers who breast-feed with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what the company claims is the "world's first silent breast pump," Elvie, a consumer technology company, released an ad inspired by a video with a bit of irony that shows mothers talking about the freedom they feel with the new breast pump.
Four real women dance in a hay barn, with cows, wearing signs such as "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, these aren't udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Feed them, feed them, I am feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I am feeding my women."
The announcement, which was posted on the company &apos; s Facebook page, has caused a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it brings the horrors of the dairy industry to the fore.
A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after giving birth," wrote one person.
The Elvie breast pump discreetly fits into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby."
Why not use them to announce a breast pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a ridiculous announcement."
Others defended the announcement, including one woman who admitted that the song was "destillante."
I think that is a great idea.
If she were still nursing, she would probably have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit far-fetched, but I don &apos; t want to dwell on it.
A woman told us, &quot; It is a brilliant product.
One person commented: "It is a funny announcement aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The dairy industry is not praised or condemned in the announcement.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreetly placed bombs in their brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who use a breast pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to a nursing bra, making it possible for users to move, hold their babies and even go out in public with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother ECD, tells us: &quot; The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallels between expressive women and cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time the Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minor immigrants discreetly relocated to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied minors apprehended has increased significantly, despite the fact that monthly apprehensions at the border have remained at near-normal levels. In part, this is due to the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal records.
Around 80 per cent of sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we are still pursuing these individuals,” said Albence.
In their haste to process juveniles more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from the time of arrest, instead of 60 days, as the previous rule, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before a judge in immigration matters.
Those not eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reports from the shelters and the system itself in recent months, the longer they are held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Concerns are even greater in larger facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of distress in these children will be overlooked.
In addition, the move to the camp without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma, which many are already suffering from.
Syria calls on the "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country's war has been in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the vice-prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the matter would be dealt with accordingly.
He said, "They must be removed immediately and unconditionally."
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any foreign illegal presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advice to the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "planting irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
He said that the government had requested the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate such returns.
They are "politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel bastion of Idlib has created an opportunity for political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a major assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters (affiliated with Al-Qaeda) who will be "eliminated."
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy of the United Nations, is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee, arguing that the panel should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Under this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are surely expecting, a resignation or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would certainly be "The most dramatic end to a presidency ever!"
There are no signs of fatigue among the spectators at the moment.
Since 2014, CNN and MSNBC ratings have doubled to 1.05 million and 1.6 million, respectively, during primetime.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime-time audience, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has surpassed cable news channels with 3.5 million viewers for its main nightly news programs.
“It is an odd attraction that we still do not understand,” Neal Baer, the executive producer of &quot; Designated Survivor, &quot; a dramatic series on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a Capitol attack, told us.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?
Scovell replied, "Because it makes me laugh."
The entertainment world is always in chaos.
Obviously, and unlike everything else on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged can afford.
However, the information overload comes when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear," the $15,000 ostrich skin jacket of Paul Manafort ("an ostentatious piece of overkill," in the words of The Washington Post), and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it is in part what makes everything seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars,” when he talks about the alternating show of Trump and his daily plot twists (whether he is fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can &apos; t afford to miss an episode if you want to keep up.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn &apos; t tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy things with programs and people were saying that this was the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss says.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.”

Foreign money flows into the midterm elections of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that money is flowing into Pennsylvania 17th District, thanks to the reorganization of a congressional district with two candidates seeking reelection to the same seat.
This residential district in Pittsburgh, which was recently redesigned, has a Democratic representative, Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another Republican challenger, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps significantly with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favour of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a funding battle between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Democrats have a slight edge.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, but then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rebuff from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization was evicted by the Panama Organization.
The State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of mission in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement this month.
Only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for Central America and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity was postponed as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials in the administration made it clear that their intention was that the conference should go ahead, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has placed on the meeting.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House in Washington, D.C., declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also investigating the possibility that Trump's campaign was working in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to this chamber, just as he is preparing to run again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and I am not suggesting that Trump's fall is inevitable, or that his European equivalents will follow suit.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans now face several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller &apos; s fate?
Rosenstein has been in the doghouse since this paper reported last year that he had suggested secretly taping the president and speculating about his inability to serve.
Rosenstein says that The Times explanation is not quite right.
“How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
On top of all this, will we vote in midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will be facing a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador &apos; s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles at the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
We got a good point, Villarreal is a good team, said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing we could do something and ended up with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but the draw was perhaps a fair result.
We were better in the first half, but we came out firing in the second half and we were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve all three points, but it will be a tough game because they have already had a good result in the previous game. But with all the support from the crowd, I am sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be OK.
The team is doing well, the boys are having a great time and we are getting good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave last year behind and achieve success.”
The fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night.
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few spoke of this with their families.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a relative, but they are not taking the steps to have this conversation, says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options can be a major factor in the cost.
Incorporate your financial advisor into the conversion, as he may also be able to help you find a way to pay for it.
Their options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover costs or insure themselves, as long as they have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Please appoint a medical power of attorney to oversee your medical care and ensure that your wishes are carried out in the event that you are unable to communicate.
It can also prepare a power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don &apos; t forget the small details: imagine your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could it answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always at hand.
Not only the finances are at stake, but what doctors are to be treated?
What medicines is he taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to plan everything.
Shots are fired at a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
He has been shot at several times with a rifle while walking home after dark.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act."
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
With communications blocked, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in northwestern Sulawesi Island.
The region, which is a lower-level administrative unit, had a population estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west coast of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Rim of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
The following is a summary of some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, Indonesia &apos; s most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, it did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Lombok Island (Indonesia) was hit by a series of earthquakes of great magnitude, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the island's northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report issued by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away.
Palin was remanded to Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and held without bond, KTUU reported.
He was arraigned in court on Saturday, where he was declared "absolutely innocent" when asked to make a statement, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a sentence of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska veterans court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence complaint and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Several veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son &apos; s violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The power and communications networks have collapsed and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just to the side of the Sulawesi centre, which is to the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bike attack on the West Side Highway bike path in lower Manhattan last October, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" eight victims and caused "serious bodily injury" "intentionally," in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York has prosecuted a death penalty case.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal death sentence in New York was carried out in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be flown in his hospital room, police said.
He was acquitted of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a life sentence without parole, without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma for all involved,” said Patton.
Saipov &apos; s defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a Tory protest at the conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should "feel the heat" from euro-sceptics, while one of Theresa May &apos; s MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Nigel Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
The challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted further by a group of Tories in favour of remaining who have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers deal on track, amid attacks from Brexit supporters, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and "chaos".
Leave Means Leave MP Chris Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now, he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I am going to defend Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
In his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also there, telling reporters: "I will say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public at large does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: &quot; Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the crowd that the politicians would feel the heat if they betrayed the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
It is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class, he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat."
“We are going to mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of the stay marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards reading &quot; Tories Against Brexit &quot; after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for the security problems they had with an application of the party during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland, he added.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be called a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump &apos; s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke event on Saturday was his 60th town hall meeting since taking office, using the town hall format he has used since taking office.
A staff member asked him if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our "irregular government," and that included having a woman in the highest office.
One arrested in the shooting death of LSU football player Sims
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot and killed Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Buffalo Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and booked into East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 7-foot-1 player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders from Mercedes would play a key role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of the picture by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to enter the pits and let Hamilton run in his slipstream, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out again on the next lap and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a move that almost had the Ferrari driver giving up the inside line at risk of being passed on the next corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 on that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished seventh in the first race.
He led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he came into boxes on lap 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to regain fourth place from Raikkonen.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman by letting me go first.
The team has done an exceptional job in finding a perfect match,” said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were &quot; bad, repugnant and false people &quot; there.
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening in the Senate these days is when you see anger, when you see bad people, disgusting people and liars,” he said.
When you read the leaks and the press reports, and then they say "But I didn't do it."
I did not do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Did you filter the document?
Oh, no.
I did not leak it.”
Hold on a minute.
Have we filtered it? No, we haven &apos; t filtered it, he replied, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the leak was reported in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford &apos; s allegations, I did not leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and, therefore, I did.”
But his refusal did not sit well with the president, who during his Saturday night rally said, "I'll tell you what: that was some really bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don &apos; t care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get the power and the control, &quot; said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made amends for their Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants on Friday night by winning the return fixture 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead of two goals thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local game before Darryl Sutter restored the Giants lead.
François Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third defeat in a row for Adam Keefe &apos; s men, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast the previous night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three.
David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later, while Kendall McFaull assisted Dwyer in the 4th minute.
In what was a very lively opening period, Sullivan put the local team on its heels at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt tied the game at 15:16 with Cownie.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night with a minute left in the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the score with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and secured the victory with his team &apos; s fifth goal as the game drew to a close.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
A controller at an airport dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake plane.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after dying in the line of duty to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to batter the area, and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, where the tower was being buffeted by strong winds.
He ensured that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
After jumping from the traffic control tower, he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australian news channel ABC.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could reach Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
“The number of victims is expected to rise, as there are still many bodies under the ruins and many people unaccounted for,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
A wave that reached six metres has devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: &quot; Every minute, an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything possible to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
That is a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
CNN reported that the United States was ready.
Indonesia had been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in early 2005, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the aircraft accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it had been unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane came in very low.
Jaynes said that was "extremely good."
Jaynes commented that he and other travellers had waded through water up to their waists to reach the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said that the passengers on board became hysterical and he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that sailors working on a nearby dock also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the aviation safety network indicate that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A chronology of the night a woman was burned alive is presented by an analyst.
The prosecution wrapped up its arguments in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014 on Saturday.
Paul Rowlett, a Department of Justice expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis, testified for hours.
He told the jury how he used the mobile phone records to track the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data of several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone records showed that Chambers &apos; mobile phone had been in contact with Sanford &apos; s phone during the time Chambers said he was with Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if he was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck with Tellis that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before Chambers &apos; death.
The mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers &apos; s death, Tellis deleted Chambers &apos; s messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "I erased her from my life."
The defence is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be decided by the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its political roots and social commentary.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Acts like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her after a text message she sent them was deemed "racist."
A New York nanny is suing a couple for wrongful termination after receiving an incorrect text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies that it is racist and compares the demand to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her shock when she discovered that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband, "NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," in a text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "discomfited" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received his pay for a day's work and sent it home on Uber.
Mauritius is now suing the couple for wrongful dismissal with the intention of receiving $350 per day for the six months of internal work she was hired for, but without a contract.
“I want to show them that things don &apos; t happen that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know it is a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice &apos; s employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they would not be able to trust him after having offended him.
My wife had sent him something he didn &apos; t want to see.
She is not racist.
Joel Plasco, the husband, told the Post, &quot; We are not racist.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone who has been rude, even if it was an accident?
To your newborn?
“Come on!”
Comparing the demand as "extortion," Plasco said his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to go after someone like that?"
That is not a very decent thing to do,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still pending, the couple has been widely condemned on social media for their behaviour and logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, as revealed in a new letter
Bond &apos; s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the map: &quot; It was hard to imagine what it would be like to read it for the first time before its publication.
It is now a great pleasure to know what we know about the great success of Paddington.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the children's book, hoped his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bittersweet" after his father's death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very quiet man who did not like to boast.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if he had a child who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, even though it was not really your achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although he was the creator and the product of his own imagination, he always gave credit to his own Paddington.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
As the plane landed, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said that her husband called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to succeed.
I received a call from Nad to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said to him: "Tashi, I love you so much, darling."
I will be there soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were wearing off slowly and leaving his system.
She had died too soon and everything was fading.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not scream, cry or yell because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold my ground.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was unfolding.
No one knew, he said.
I bowed my head and tears were constantly falling.
It is hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all your love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.”
Widows wearing black are a bridge to suicide
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting inspirational cards on a Welsh bridge with phone numbers people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up any place.
However, he left the job before dying, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried about the implications."
Davis created the cards &quot; so people know there are people to talk to and people to talk to, even if they are a friend.
Don &apos; t sit there in silence, you have to talk about it.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been together for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
He did not say he was depressed or anything like that, he tells us.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in their attitude.
Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.”
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they must learn to cope: "It leaves a void in the whole family."
He left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
“If we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited time frame, limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going off the rails” in the midst of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican allies not want the FBI investigation?
His refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
Five weeks remain until the midterm elections on November 6, and if the Republicans have a bad showing, their efforts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the land will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President &apos; s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean defector &quot; defections &quot; are falling
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification South, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by human traffickers, have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers desertion illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
In early May, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting between United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea &apos; s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
Without US confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm, Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh &quot; a historic low &quot; and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said that the nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was a "histrionic" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Pelosi said, "I can't help but think if a woman had acted that way, they would have called her hysterical."
Kavanaugh used his emotion to deny the sexual assault allegations against him by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking as he spoke of his family and his years of secondary education.
At the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by some angry liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against Democrats.
He said he thought he was "self-destructing" with such statements and the way he had pursued the Clintons and Democrats.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
“I will say one thing: if he is lying to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he is not fit to be on the court he is on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an hysterical, impartial person to go to court and expect us to think everything is fine," Pelosi said.
And women have to wield it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury spilling out, and she cannot let it go without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don &apos; t think that &apos; s so unusual, do you?”
He continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was talking: "Perhaps you think I am crying because I am sad."
No, I am not angry.”
And he continued with what he was doing.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Crying is allowed as a way out of anger in part because it is not really understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once when I found myself crying with an unexpressed rage. A senior woman manager, a serious person I had always been slightly afraid of, grabbed me by the hair and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
He told me, "Never let them see you cry."
They have no idea that you are furious.
They think you are sad and will be glad to think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business, a ship named after the affair that forced her to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea of running herself for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they did not need another one.
Someone called us "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
As the campaign was already well under way, he fell behind in fund-raising, so he promised that he would not enter the race again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost cause.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I get a discount?” he asked.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotion (gratitude for those who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on capturing voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism) that she choked.
Schroeder said, "It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown," recalling the reaction of the press.
You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
“Did it cry?”
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although much remains to be done to end the battle, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning in early 2018 by imposing tariffs on China &apos; s main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which will tax half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has retaliated by imposing tariffs of between 5 and 10 per cent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match the United States, and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world will soon ease up.
To back down would be to concede to the demands, but to publicly submit to the United States would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the United States &apos; s trade war could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a crash landing in the economy in either country is actually much more dangerous than the audience has recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to receive the refugees, says the foreign minister.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions were improving.
The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is still trying to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last win in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe reclaimed the crown when the Thomas Bjorn team of Denmark won 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American golfer Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, admitted defeat by hitting his tee shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, conceding defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to ever shoot a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen, 5 and 4.
World number one Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio García, a veteran who has won eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most victories in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
I don &apos; t usually cry, but today I can &apos; t help it.
It has been a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have recovered the cup.
It was a team effort and I am very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team &apos; s victory.
Now it is Rahm's turn to carry the torch, having beaten the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a singles match on Sunday.
John Rahm, 23-year-old golfer, said he felt an incredible sense of pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, whom he had grown up watching.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf all weekend.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting."
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we blew it.
I would like to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Its 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it is our turn to bow.
They have surpassed us.”
Red tide update: Red tide concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FFWC) shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, irregular bloom conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a reduction in concentrations.
The red tide bloom extends approximately 130 miles along the coast from Pinellas County to Lee County.
Irregular parcels can be found as far as 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
Red tides have also been detected in Pasco County.
During the past week, medium concentrations have been reported in Pinellas County and its coast, low concentrations in Hillsborough County, medium concentrations in Manatee County, low concentrations in Sarasota County and its coast, medium concentrations in Charlotte County, medium concentrations in Lee County and its coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwestern part of Florida during the past week.
