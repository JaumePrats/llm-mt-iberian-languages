In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that is already generally accepted, the fossils also offer specific data that is not usually found in fossils, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this animal has a chestnut-colored plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotene-colored plumage on the lower part.
Moreover, the discovery helps us understand better the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of dinosaurs lacks a well-developed axis, called a raquis, but does have other feather features (quills and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raquis is the result of a later evolutionary development of these other feather features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but to regulate body temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers claim that, although the tail of a young dinosaur is being analyzed, the sample analyzed presents features of an adult's plumage and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, although the tail of a young dinosaur is shown, the specimen illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

Candidates have the right to send representatives to oversee each stage of the process and, during the night, volunteers count the votes under a rigorous supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

A law was proposed by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill proposes that violent video games sold in California must be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of the Crown Prosecution Service, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.

Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed a facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon jammed while aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, can only see with one of his eyes, part of his skull is missing and his face was reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a virtual link from a US Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races apart from the Wednesday competition.
The first was slalom, in which he got a "Did not finish the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other career, the giant slalom, she finished 10th in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four sitting skiers in the Slalom Giant category failed to complete their races and a total of 45 participants in the Slalom Giant race failed to qualify for the finals.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh recovered the laptop and the mobile phone stolen.
The deputy inspector general, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the Superintendent of Police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused presented themselves before the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house at the time of the accident, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver of the Audi TT red.
In the beginning, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Court of the County of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is under custody awaiting the accusation and the trial, any witness's testimony can be questioned, as her image has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said: "It seems that journalists are walking on thin ice when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is in charge of the processing, told the press that they would not make any further comments until the case is presented to the court.
According to the information that has been leaked, the document will deal with the Palestinian conflict, which will be based on the existing borders, as they were in 1967.
Other topics that were also discussed, according to the information provided, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the complementary pest control trial, the game wardens had to supervise the shooters closely, as this was monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Association of Target Shooters of New South Wales (NSW), volunteers were recruited for the Association's shooting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is currently in charge of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS, said that the four shooters were given a full training and safety briefing.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it's the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the generalised protests that started in October against the regime.
The protests, at times violent, were caused by the fact that no elections were held, in some cases since 2011.
There have been about 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating, which caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry commented on Apple's delay in the report, saying it was "truly lamentable."
Mariana was shaken by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands reported no damage on the Northern Mariana Islands.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer kidnapped a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old lady because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began studying medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
The study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday the investigators of the government were able to recover the black boxes of the missing plane.
Luna's companions also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She died on the night of two full moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Runnels said: "Luna was as rare as I am; even more so. I love her and I'll miss her. I hope she's in a better place."
Between 2008 and 2010, when 1,400 people were surveyed in advance of the 2010 federal elections, there was a 8% increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal elections that she considered Australia should become a republic once the Queen's reign ended.
34% of the surveyed share this view and want Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
On the other end of the survey, 29% of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; on the other end, 31% think it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner in the 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle swimming events had to swim in the freestyle style, and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned after his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers because it is forbidden to use them in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using various hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists expect to understand how planets are formed, particularly our own, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He called it "political gossip and nonsense"
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old radar technology, with the aim of enabling air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered that the game would be played behind closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the magazine Science reported on a study that informed about the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden revealed that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated to take much longer, due to the reproduction between a Darwin's endemic pinzón and a cactus-migrating pinzón, Geospiza fortis and Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can you hammer and roll it into sheets, but you can also stretch it into a very thin wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it could be used to decorate hand-made illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the juice of the cabbage will change depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydronium ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Thus, a proton-free hydrogen ion is the result of removing a proton from an electron.
Mix both powders together and, after mixing them, with your hands clean and wet, form a ball.
A reaction will occur between the moisture in their hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage in almost all houses, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes of the cities of Minoan Crete and Santorini, Greece, were found traces of sewer systems.
They also had public baths in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope to space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to make travel much easier and faster.
Thanks to her we have many means of transportation, like the railway or the automobile, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including feral cats) that feed on small prey species that are much more abundant than the large prey species that they are adapted to eat, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the big cats that socialize the most and their lives take place in large groups called prides.
Manes are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, joined with up to thirty females and their young.
Generally, females are very close to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in a similar way to wolf packs or dog packs, with a surprising similarity (unlike other large cats) in their behaviour and that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger is an integral athlete, able to climb (but not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. In the best case scenario, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will be smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) through their sense of smell, smelling the ground where the prey has passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places, and they move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey mimicking their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
No changes have been made to the original population, which still needs the same adaptations as in the past.
As time goes by, as the population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will not be able to be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
Plant food is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. They also offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so nothing else feared it, except other Mosasaurs.
Their long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth like knives, plus another group of teeth in the palate, which means that anything that came in front of them, had no escape.
We don't have the certainty, but it could have been a viper. Its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurids, and even could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a T. Rex was no threat to him.
While most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the hedgehog.
Another thing that distinguished them was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the rich enjoyed sharing meals and lying down while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of the ancient Rome included foods that arrived to Europe centuries after.
In other words, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate, or any Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, considered their home.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to satisfy their needs by holding ceremonies and festivals.
Temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
In some cases, special towers were built with a pyramid shape, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the patio; shops were just showrooms that faced the street. Houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no big forests; thus, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey westward, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Despite the discovery, the Eskimos were already living there.
While each country was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you might think that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has the following text on its reverse: "Declaration of Independence, Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is written on the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that it was made shortly after the event, the huge scroll (measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
While the D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, the south was still to be liberated.
The government was in the hands of the French "Vichy" group, who in 1940 had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the Allied forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that forms part of a large group of people who live and work together; in other words, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and relates to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, as well as civitas, which means city or city state, and which, in addition, determines the size of the society.
States are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization has a long-lasting transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy, and a homogenous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilisations in their own right.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was the only component.
The Congress did not have the capacity to set taxes, and since it was a national executive or judicial power, the function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to enforce all of its laws.
He was not qualified to annul or reduce taxes or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval from all states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave the government so little importance that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan there are about 7,000 islands (the largest one is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who were sailing through the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, of a Dutch East India Company base in the southwest of Taiwan, started a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty army (1644-1912) took control of the coastal region of northern Taiwan in 1683 and declared it as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see how they looked originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and the works continue to this day.
For example, the most common format for still photography at the global level is 35mm, which was the most commonly used film size towards the end of the era of film photography.
Today, the phenomenon still occurs, but the most important thing is that the dimensional relationship has been transferred to the digital image sensors of the cameras.
In truth, the 35mm format is confusing, as its measurements are 36mm wide by 24mm tall.
This is why it is said that the dimensional relation of this format (dividing by 12 to calculate the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g. APS group) are similar or look very much like this relation of appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and often mocked, is a simple rule that generates dynamism while also allowing for a certain order to be given to the images.
Indicates that the most effective place to put the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had united the European states despite their different languages and customs.
Its power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the commoner.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be used for that specific purpose.
The central cupola of the church had remained in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the war began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognized international right and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted water from international waters to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral ships at risk.
After having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought they would be facing a similar reaction to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at Edison in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation letter written by his manager Charles Batchelor (his last employer) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same happens with the military, as they now base the ranks on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other people of the oppressed working class to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to visit a cave called "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured the test of time, illustrates in a very realistic way the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one was sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the marvelous clear sky and the numerous mountains around. From the inside of this cave, you can see and hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramids of the same shape and size built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The "upward arrow" logo resembles a V and the "downward arrow" logo resembles a grap or a square without its bottom edge.
Above means to start at the tip and push the bow, and below means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, while a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the bow have been printed in that place for a musical purpose, and therefore should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Luis Carlos, 4 years old), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threw threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolution shook the head of a executed guard in front of the queen who was in panic.
The Filipino people paid the war costs of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of paying the majority of the government's interest and expenses on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
Already, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of profits for the American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in which these events take place is known as the Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around the 1500.
The deterministic technological concept encompasses a broad range of ideas, from the impulse or imperative technological to a strict sense of that there is a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and that it is related to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on its own independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national highway network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new techniques of manufacturing are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
The widespread use of automobiles also leads to a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The determinism of culture was very present in the romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded people and, with the passage of time, customs and cultures related to that geography developed that, being in harmony with that geography, were preferred to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered as such in the feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and extended until around 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, the status of the city declined, especially due to the fact that, upon their return, the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "Capital of Fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the way of dressing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western styles could take a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe started to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is understood as the production of enough food to feed only the farmer and his family.
The subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of seeds from the region's original ecological zone with crop rotation and other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of the farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many countries in the path of development.
Subcultures gather individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality due to social standards and provide them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic traits of their belonging, such as distinctive and symbolic styles of dress, gestures and slang.
One of the most common mechanisms for graphically representing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by their parents, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or fleeing.
It is said that some were raised by animals and that some have lived in the wild.
When a child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical capabilities) almost identical to those of the animal that raised it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Although learning based on projects should make the process easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also a small animated paperclip from Microsoft Office is a type of scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolds are included in the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to understand on their own.
Children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care or education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family-based system provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The objective of the family-based care is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home of the child before being placed in a foster home.
The Internet combines the mass communication features with the communication between people.
The different traits that the Internet opens up to new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of users to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), the authors also detected "personal participation" and "durable relationships" as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that, by reading microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of a speaker.
It also suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, like domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been proven that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation involves a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes that variation from the set of variations.
The segregation and recombination of genes shuffle the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the resources of plants that it has available.
Not doing it can cause serious problems: stunted growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been the simplest source of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except when cooked.
On the other hand, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees do today.
Interrupting sleep is waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a soft alarm clock that will wake you up without waking you up completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we are all connected. Each one of us has the potential to find peace and absolute happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that obstructs the path is our tension and negativity.
While the basis of Tibetan Buddhism is the teachings of Buddha, they extended to the path of love Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, la laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga poses, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the channels of energy can be cleared, the chakras can be activated and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up by distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would spread over the next 40 years and would be fought with substitute militias, in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that the Polish defense was already broken down on September 17th, 1939, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union invaded and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, bilateral and multilateral agreements, and other international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to guarantee that its country can move its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The Atlantic Campaign in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have taken over Britain, just as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
With the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and skin, the ancient tribes and peoples started to hunt them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of grazing, often tended by herdsmen who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd. These methods of grazing are still used today.
In England, railways had been installed in the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carriages were made of simple parallel boards of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place occurred quite early. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron at their upper part.
This became a common practice, although the iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the trains.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767, iron rails were used.
The first form of transportation known was walking. Humans began to do it upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, join environmentalist movements or even become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, the suffering of the future.
In many cases, it's like the asintomatic treatment. But if we're not only looking for a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and try to deactivate it.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, due to the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
Copies were made, during the night, between 150 and 200, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8th.
On July 6th, 1776, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on July 9th. On August 10th, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly skin and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers function based on the manipulation of data encoded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is finding an open bottle of medicine or toxic cleaning products.
Read the label to get specific information about the first aid for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term insect parasite in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with lice, a very developed parasite for humans.
Bedbugs and bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States is estimated at around 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, which includes the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
Studies showed that women have twice the chances of men to suffer from EM.
A couple might conclude that raising a child would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could plan to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific research.
This is not an experiment, but a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing phenomena that guide scientific research.
The focus of naturalists and philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those on science and psychology, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, Western civilization distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free-running period even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA was a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA of the frog with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic fragment and if it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking pictures and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic launch of a transportation system, everyone is somehow connected to a system of transportation based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Currently, scientists believe that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
All of us are part of the society and use the transportation systems; and almost all of us complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear such complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason behind the complaints of such a caliber and why do they happen daily? Are the engineers of transportation simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to be represented by a logical consistency and to be approximated by mathematical representation.
In order to graphically clarify the flow of circulation, the three most important elements were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both planning and design as well as the operations of the road vehicles.
The first species to fly were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible hiding places from predators.
Currently, the only insects that are unable to fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Millennia ago, a man called Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we don't perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon River is the largest river in the world by volume and the second largest in the world by length.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water that flows from the rivers of the world that ends up in the oceans, 20% comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6,387 km (3,900 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian city of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest country in terms of population.
The Italian language is used in the Vatican City, both for drafting its regulations and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that most people working in the state speak daily is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in the Vatican City are adherents to the Roman Catholic Church.
The basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gas, plasma, but at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the Periodic Table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements like calcium and potassium. From the start, there are also metals like gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
As a result, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, due to the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to approach a pencil.
Only time will tell what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill. Dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
Some atoms' nuclei are unstable, which means they tend to decompose with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer shell is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the side close to the Earth and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more lakes on the side closer to the volcano, due to the thinner crust, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines claim that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up until they reached maturity.
These theories analyze what causes some people to want the things they do and what factors of their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
To the managers of this category it is hard to take decisions that fall on the employees, impose disciplinary measures, carry out performance evaluations, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from the staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes that everything that has been done until now needs to be changed and done in their own way.
In the end, the leader is the one who is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
Generally, they enjoy more autonomy than members of a traditional group, thanks to the possibility of their teams to meet at different times, which might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organization to submit itself to the process of establishing an organization of learning? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that an organization that works as a team to overcome a difficulty in place to a new innovative process to meet the needs of customers.
To make an organization innovative, the leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous focus as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offers factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Thus, it reduces the field of research and gives it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a speciality of great relevance within computer science, which is responsible for behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and consultation requests from customers, as well as facial recognition, handwriting and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real life problems.
Artificial Intelligence is now used frequently in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, just as it was incorporated in various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe the objects on display in a museum, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as a photo album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. Even though students often start their blogging experience with a poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Due to the fact that students are the readers who tend to criticize the most, the blogger starts to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also requires students to be more understanding of the world around them. The need to engage the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics." (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more south and north of Muskoka, and the natural beauty is not exploited.
All these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The northernmost areas are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
For a comparison of population that causes great surprise to many: more African Americans live in the United States than Canadians.
The location of the African Eastern Islands is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wild life.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, in large part, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The first European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery of the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that connects the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is advised that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in rejecting men and don't be afraid to defend your position (there are cultural differences or not, that's not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians, who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by Sultan of Morocco with the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist attraction in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left a large part of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit to the outside must be considered in order to take knowledge of the situation of the conflicts that persist in the North Kivu province.
The city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo Volcano and its gorilla trekking excursions are the most economical in Africa.
To travel inside Goma, you can take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given Tombuctú an exotic and distant image.
Tombuctú is a poor city today, but it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was included in the World Heritage List due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special African Miracles, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends to the Mozambique border in the east, Zimbabwe border in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, in each of which a different wild life is developed.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all the natural reserves of South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to all the National Parks in South Africa or all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
The Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a bar graph that shows the presence of the Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon side.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where the city's urban development is most dense.
This is the site that the British colonists adopted as their own. For this reason, if you wish to see proof of the past colonial history of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Despite this, the forests are not just mangroves, but also contain some of the last remaining trees of the once-impressive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of the wild life and it is estimated that there are 400 tigers in the area and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the bus station to different districts (on the other side of the river) all day, but most of them, especially those going to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket with a few days of advance.
Most of the districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a structure that spans the river, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3,5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, which is when it is expected that Brazilian customs controls will be lifted.
The area that currently constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence farming.
The region of Ceara was inhabited by other aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian tribes.
The Spanish started the colonization stage, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and matches can be seen in other parts of the year.
On the website of the Argentine Association of Polo you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in relation to the British Pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. It is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling is accepted in most places in the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There is a chance that the islands in the periphery do not accept credit cards, but they might accept British or American cash. Ask the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money from the Malvinas Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do it before leaving.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere is winter and viceversa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent summer temperatures above +30°C.
Winter cold can be deceptive: though it is very rare for temperatures to drop below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" seasons; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild life is still wild, so don't feed it or disturb it.
According to the authorities of the parks, you must keep at least 100 yards/meters of distance from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from the rest of wild animals.
Despite how gentle they may appear, the fact is that bison, bighorn sheep, elk, bears, and most large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors suffer injuries each year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous; thus, respect their space.
Remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so you should avoid cooking food that releases a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of around 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval battle when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except for a British cruiser. More than two hundred Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches in Auckland due to the fact that it has two ports. The most famous ones are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, in the Pacific Ocean, are the beaches of North Shore, which stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of the beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
In the Waitemata Harbour, the beaches of Tamaki Drive, the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, and the central region of Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the local beer most popular and is not complex, but rather refreshing and pleasant.
While there is a great variety of French wines, the ones from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transport.
The water from the tap is perfectly safe for consumption, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of "black coffee" as foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
Belgian chocolate is up to the Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and there, injuries caused by any of these causes are rare.
However, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all the signals and pay special attention to the security alerts.
The Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April, north of 1770. They can be found outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where the saltwater crocodiles live. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
The advance booking of accommodation gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to stay when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even packages combining flights and accommodation.
You can also keep the reservation in case you need time to think better about the offer, or to get other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, most of the attendees camp at the venue and most of the attendees consider camping as a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you should arrive early to the camp to get a good spot for the musical events.
It is important to note that, while the musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special areas for camping, designed for families with children.
If you're going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is located, as crossing the ice generates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During the cruises to St. Petersburg, one also spends time in the city. Visa requirements are waived for those who disembark (see terms).
Casinos normally make great efforts to maximize the time and money their customers spend. In general, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special food, drink and entertainment promotions to keep guests in good spirits and within the premises.
Some establishments serve free alcoholic drinks. Although drunkenness affects judgment and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Any person who intends to drive in high latitudes or in mountain passes must be prepared for the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy or snow-covered roads, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as one does on a bare asphalt.
