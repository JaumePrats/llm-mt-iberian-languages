Members of the Gal·les assembly concerned because "they are Muppets"
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposal to change the title of the assembly to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This debate has arisen as a result of the change in the name of the Parliament.
Members of all political parties have expressed their concern that this measure could become a laughing stock.
A member of the Labour Party's assembly has said that his party is concerned about the fact that MWP is "linked to Twp or Pwp".
For readers who do not speak Galician: twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member of Plaid Cymru &apos; s Assembly commented that his party &apos; s &quot; partnership &quot; was &quot; not working &quot; and proposed various alternatives.
For his part, a conservative MP from Galicia had said that his group was 'open', but he would also say that there was a big difference between the terms 'MWP' and 'Muppet'.
In this context, I would say that the letter &quot; w &quot; is pronounced similarly to the letter &quot; u &quot; in Yorkshire English.
According to the Committee on the Legal Status of the Assembly, the final decision on the qualification of any Member of the Assembly shall rest with the Assembly itself.
The 2017 Law of the Government of Galicia grants the Assembly of Galicia the power to change its name.
In June, the committee will publish the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to Parlament gal·lès.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, while the committee is to decide on "Members of Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "WPM" is the one that will provide for a wider public consultation.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the intention to pass a motion of censure against the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal opinion on the matter in the coming week.
Legislation on the reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly would vote on the final name during the debate on the legislation.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
The citizens of Skopje want to change the name of their country to "Republic of Macedonia of the North".
The popular consultation will decide on a dispute that has been going on for decades between the country and Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time that the name of its northern representative is a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he will ignore the vote on changing the name.
Those who are in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields stop ringing: the difficulties of Harlem churches
“Historically, there has always been a bar and a church in every canton,” commented Mr. Adams.
Today, there is no choice between the two.
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars could be understood.
“People have another way of socialising today”, he comments.
"The bars are no longer the same as they used to be. They are now frequented by people from all over the world."
He is concerned that the dinners that are obtained from the sale of acts do not last as long as the leaders &apos; &quot; expect them to &quot; and that they are &quot; late &quot; when they leave.
Churches, chapels, convents and monasteries could be replaced by apartment blocks and condominiums of the type that would not be of any help to the churches that remained in the barri.
“The vast majority of people who live in these buildings are white,” he said, “and the fact that they will be accelerating the closure of all churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who live in these buildings are members of these churches.”
Two white churches were built before Harlem became a Negro metropolis; Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin-in-the-Fields in 1960.
The white Methodist congregation has been in existence for 30 years.
A black congregation that has been renting the building is now buying it.
St. Martin's is to be taken over by a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who is to lead a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main commercial thoroughfares, who are resisting the hiring or promotion of Negroes.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when the Reverend Johnson's congregation decided to rebuild it, they had to wait until they could afford the carpenter.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of the late Reverend Johnson and successor to the St. Martin's Church, will describe the bells as "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who is going to give evidence on 1 July will describe it in a different way: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, will also observe that the first carillon of the world is being played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who is going to transfer the largest carillon in Riverside Church in 18 years.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's will not be replaced.
The one that has sounded at St. Martin's during the past few months, on the other hand, has been the history of architects and contractors, some of whom have been led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the bishop.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish, is to write to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese should "transmit the costs" to the parish council, and that the council should not be involved in the contracting of architects and contractors that the diocese is going to send.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was gored by a bull in California
A bull attacked and gored a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was wading for lobsters in California, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The assault will take place just before 7 a.m. at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been in the water for about an hour and a half with a group of friends when they heard the cries for help. They went to the location and found the man in the water and helped him out.
Hammel was so pleased to have caught a lobster that he said "I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've caught a lobster, I've
He had his whole collarbone broken, Hammel said.
Hammel said: "Everyone who comes out of the water, I shout: 'There is a bull in the water!'"
The child will be transported by air to Rady Children &apos; s Hospital in San Diego, where he will be in a critical condition.
It is not known what type of bull was responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, EMT Larry Giles said that a week earlier, a bull had been spotted in the area, but that he had decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles will testify that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper chest.
The authorities will close the beaches at Ponto Beach, Casablanca Beach, Swami's Beach and Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there were more than 135 species of bull in the area, but that most of them were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury &apos; s plans for the UK food market
Sainsbury &apos; s has decided to give Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams a licence to sell beauty products in the style of large department stores staffed by specialists.
These are only one part of a considerable investment in the market for beauty products in the United Kingdom, a market worth some £2.8 billion and one which continues to grow, while the fashion and beauty sectors remain buoyant, and they will open 11 outlets across the country this year in order to expand.
The investment in products of beauty is an investment in the space of the supermarkets to benefit from the space of the televisions, radios and products of the hearth.
Sainsbury's states that it will double its beauty offer to over 3,000 different products, including leading brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also have more space for brands that look similar to those found in Boots.
The supermarket chain is also in the process of revamping its range of make-up products so that the majority of them are suitable for vegans, an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The minorista chain The Fragrance Shop will open two concessions in Sainsbury's stores next week, the first in Croydon, south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, next month.
Buying food online and in smaller quantities every day has meant that the big supermarkets have had to find other ways of convincing people to shop there.
According to Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, the stores will be assembled into larger units in an attempt to take on the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury &apos; s has introduced the sale of Argos goods in many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat shops, which it is acquiring in its entirety. He comments that this has helped to increase sales of furniture and to improve the reliability of purchases.
The original intent of the chain of supermarkets to sell cosmetics and pharmaceuticals will result in a failure.
Sainsbury &apos; s is planning a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it is likely to end in acrimony over how to divide the benefits of the pharmacy chain within supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale of 281 Sainsbury's pharmacies to LloydsPharmacy for £125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have an important role to play in the overall group, as it will expand the range of luxury brands for skin care, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, comments: "We have changed the look of our past products to improve the environment for our customers."
We are investing in workers who are specifically trained to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the practical location make it one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of buying them.”
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby signs £11m deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is set to be "furious" after the presenter Holly Willoughby signed a £11 million endorsement deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby did not have the time to devote to the joint negotiation of products of the furnace and accessories Truly.
The negotiations between these two media personalities had reached the point where they were being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, is going to use Instagram to announce her engagement.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones fuming by pulling out at the last minute of a multimillion-pound deal with lifestyle brand M&S and ITV, which will also report big benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was &quot; furious &quot; when the red star of television was admitted, during a tense meeting held at his central office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, that the presenter &apos; s contract, worth £1.5 million, would mean that he would no longer have time to devote to the joint brand of lighters and accessories Truly.
The negotiations had reached the stage of comparing the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow with Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Quan Willoughby, aged 37, is going to use Instagram to announce the launch of Truly, Jones is going to take a private jet to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source: &quot; Truly, it was Holly's main priority.
It was intended to be my future home and I wanted to live there for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision will leave no words for all the parties involved.
No one could believe what was going to happen on Tuesday, we were so close...
There is a room full of goods at the Marlow warehouse to be sold.”
According to the experts, the presenter of This Morning, one of the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions of pounds because of the significant investment that had been made in products, from chickens and eggs to crockery and cutlery, and the possibility of delays in its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a three-year-old mare owned by Dan Baldwin and ridden by Jones and his wife Tara Capp, have been in an intimate relationship for some time.
Willoughby will found the Truly Joint Council with Capp in 2016, and Jones, who is 52, will take over the presidency in March.
Jones and Baldwin have a 40 per cent stake in the television production company of Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A proper reply to Jones would be "We will not comment on your negotiations."
Hard accusations... "I want to fall in love with you"
I am making fun of the possible criticisms that will come from the media for making a comment that some will consider "out of place from a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why has Trump given up so much?
Trump is going to assert, totally unfounded, that he won the election.
I have not renounced.
You will note that Kim had an interest in holding a second meeting following the first held in Singapore in June, which was declared a great success in the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations towards nuclear disarmament are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho will tell the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to its first disarmament initiatives.
You will observe that the United States continues to apply sanctions with the objective of maintaining pressure.
Trump &apos; s point of view was much more optimistic in his speech.
He will say, "I have a very good relationship with North Korea."
We declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people lost their lives.
I will maintain this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong-un had yielded positive results: no more missile tests, aid for the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
I will defend my usual focus on relations with North Korea.
"It's very easy to be president, but when you have 10,000 people trying to get into this building full of people, and you only have 200, that's a lot of people," he said.
One island destroyed, hundreds of deaths caused by tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it will tell the non-governmental organizations in other countries that they are not necessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok will be displaced, Lombok will not declare a national disaster, in order to be eligible for international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, so the situation is very demanding,” Mrs. Sumbung commented.
If Save the Children is organising a team to go to Palu, it is not sure that foreigners can work on the land.
Mr. Sutopo, head of the National Disaster Management Agency, will comment that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies could help.
The constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common elsewhere.
The apparent lack of sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, even though an alert was in place, is likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge number of islands of Indonesia, in the best of cases, a reptile.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital vessel that was on its way to Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake was diverted to Palu; it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo was the central element of his electoral campaign to improve Indonesia's infrastructure, spending huge amounts of money on roads and railways.
Tanmateix, the governor of Joko's government is facing an election year in which he has to deal with a deficit in financing.
Joko also faced the pressure of sectarian tensions in the country, with members of the Muslim majority adopting a more conservative stance.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced as a result of the clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other blood-stained weapons.
Observes: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores the equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat at Chelsea with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday.
Sturridge will have a shot from Xherdan Shaqiri &apos; s 27-metre pass just outside Chelsea &apos; s goal when his team is losing 1-0.
It will accommodate the pilot cap to the left before leaving an incredible mess behind.
The shot will cover the entire area with a great elevation while propelling the ball into the right corner of the goal.
In the end, the pilot will attempt to land on top of a Kepa Arrizabalaga, but will end up in the middle of the network.
“I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always try to get there as early as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanté coming, I saw him coming and I didn't think about it, I just wanted to hit him.
Chelsea won 1-0 after Eden Hazard's goal in the 25th minute.
In the play, the left-back of the blue team, Mateo Kovacic, made a pass to Mateo Kovacic in front of the goal and then sprinted all the way to the Liverpool goal.
Kovacic is going to make a quick combination from the middle.
Tot seguit, you made a fantastic pass in depth, leaving Hazard in your wake.
Hazard will get past the defence to finish off the second goal with a left-footed shot from the edge of the area and Alisson will not be able to reach him.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. London time.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country &apos; s disaster agency.
Many people will be trapped between the collapsed buildings due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that will take place on Thursday and will cause flooding up to 6 metres, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Agency.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, will be completely covered by the rubble of the destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a dead woman
The investigation into the murder began after the body of the woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, yesterday morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found dead at 7.55 a.m. at Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked the residents of the area to report any suspicious activity to the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan's statement: "If the investigation is still in the preliminary stage, I would call on everyone who was at John Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have been able to pick up any information from the camera in the taxi, as this could be vital to the investigation.
A police officer has confirmed that the woman is from Birkenhead and that she will be found in a property.
This evening, friends who think they know the woman have arrived on the scene of the crime to ask whether she has been found.
While the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are in contact with the victim &apos; s closest relatives.
A taxi driver who saw Grayson Mews had tried to turn back, but the police told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
If you do not know what has happened, you will have no words.
The residents are becoming aware that they will not be able to return to their homes for some time.
You will be able to see a police officer explaining to a man that the whole area is covered by the crime scene.
A woman comes on stage crying.
It keeps repeating "It's terrible!"
At 2 p.m., two police vans were found parked outside the cordoned-off area.
A number of Romanian agents in the cordoned-off area controlling the apartment block.
Any person who has information that they wish to pass on to @MerPolCC directly, or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 247 of 30 September, should do so.
The statue of Oliver Cromwell in the British Parliament has been defaced again, this time with the words "rewrite history"
His disappearance would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England by his fanatical followers.
Cromwell Society has described Crick &apos; s proposal as &quot; hogwash &quot; and &quot; an attempt to rewrite history &quot;.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main issues.
The iconoclasm of the civil wars in England was not ordered or directed by Cromwell.
Potser s'acabaria sacrificant el Cromwell incorrecte per les accions del seu avantpassat que va fer durant el segle anterior.
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith is going to tell The Sunday Telegraph: 'Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more so at the end of the nineteenth century than at any other time, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes a wholly accurate representation of Roman history is a matter of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the seventeenth century will shape the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure representing this division.
Their association with Lord Protector is also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A pig has killed a shepherd in Catalonia
A granger was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the south-west of Xina, according to local reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood at a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject cows into pigs at a farm in Xining, Qinghai Province.
As a matter of fact, he had sold 15 pigs from Yunnan Province on Wednesday.
The next morning, he found a door open to a pigsty next door.
According to him, there was a pig in the court with blood on its mouth.
The forensic examination will confirm that the 250-kilogram load had killed the driver, according to the report.
He said: "My legs were broken and full of blood."
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
It will be found about an hour later.
The animal that the man was going to kill was not the property of Yuan or his son.
One of those responsible for the market will comment on the news of the evening that the pig will be slaughtered and skinned in order to avoid further attacks, while the police collect the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to information received, the family of Yuan and the persons responsible for his death are negotiating compensation.
Very few cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
In the past, a pig weighing 300 kg would be tied to a tractor so that the farmer's wife could scare it away.
After a pig farmer in Oregon was killed by his pigs in 2012, a pig farmer in Manitoba is going to tell CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They like to play.
They are children, they are curious, they do not have the idea of doing harm.
We can only give them the respect they deserve.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the south-west of the United States
According to the forecasts, Hurricane Rosa has been weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States during those days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, equivalent to a category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. EDT on Sunday, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rosa is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is forming in the eastern Pacific, moving eastwards towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will become a strong tropical storm, moving northwards towards the south-west United States.
Rosa will leave 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
The interaction of the tropical atmosphere with the approaching depression will result in widespread torrential rainfall over the south-west during the next few days.
At various points between 25 and 100 mm of rainfall, flash floods, run-off and the possibility of desertification will occur.
The strong tropical air mass will cause 50 to 75 mm per hour precipitation rates at various locations, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Expect 50 to 100 mm of rain in the southwest, especially in Arizona.
There is the possibility of forming riuades, as soon as the situation is worsening rapidly because of the dispersed nature of the tropical cyclones.
It is totally unwise to enter the desert before the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential downpours could turn the gorges into uncontrolled rivers, and storms could carry away trees and boulders.
The depression will bring torrential rains to specific areas of the southern California coast.
It is possible that the total precipitation over 50 mm, which could cause minor run-off and rill erosion.
It would be the first time in the region.
Tropical storms will begin to arrive in Arizona between Saturday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread.
Torrential rains are expected in the region of the Four Cantons on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be a number of important temperature oscillations in the United States as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
This phenomenon can cause drastic changes in temperature within a short distance.
The central United States is a clear example of dramatic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of 20 degrees Fahrenheit have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During those days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand further.
It is expected that the month of October will start with high temperatures in the centre and east of the United States, with temperatures of up to 27 °C in the area of the Plains southwards to the north-east.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, which would be 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-range forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures will be above normal over the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers will see Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million viewers will be able to watch the compelling testimony of the candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who will accuse him of sexual abuse, Christine Blasey Ford, who is expected to testify in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting their usual Friday programming because of a last-minute scheduling change: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake so that the FBI could complete its investigation of the allegations within a week.
Ford will explain to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh would grope her and try to take her clothes off at a party at the institute.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, is going to say that this will not pass.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers saw the testimony on Friday.
The company counted on the presence of observers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The hearings were not immediately available on other channels other than PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen has problems in calculating the number of people he has seen at his office.
In perspective, it is similar to a playoff game in American football or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders of which have clearly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, will be the channel with the most viewers, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day, according to Nielsen.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS will get $3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC $2.89 million and CNN $2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest is maintained after the testimony.
Flake will be the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the office of moderate Republican Senator Jeff Flake issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was heckled by CNN and CBS anchors on Friday morning as he tried to get into an elevator to go to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake is going to talk about a variety of issues with his eyes closed while being interviewed live on CNN.
Here, in front of you, a woman says, &quot; Here, in front of you &quot;.
Do you think that the truth is being served by the country?
Li van dir 'tu tens poder, while that hi ha tants dones that no en tenen!"
Flake will say that his office has issued a statement and, before the doors of the lift are opened, he will say that he will have more to say to the committee.
At 5 p.m., all the cable and broadcast channels were broadcasting live the moment when the Committee on the Judiciary had to vote whether to confirm or not the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Flake will say, in effect, that he will only support the nomination if the FBI investigates the allegations against Kavanaugh next week, which is the condition demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake will be convinced by the conversations he will have with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Senator Coons and other senators, Flake will make his decision.
The triad option of Flake had influence, as it was obvious that Republicans would not vote for Kavanaugh without support from Democrats.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May will accuse those who criticise her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May addresses the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the paper, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is expected to reinforce his attack on the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU are mutually recapturing taxes is "utterly absurd".
The murder of Wayde Sims in Trets: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson for the murder of the LSU football player
The police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder by the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities will release a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims will lose his ears during the fight.
The police will recover the udders at the crime scene and claim to have found the DNA of Simpson on them, according to the CBS WAFB affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police admitted that Wayde had died from a gunshot wound.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office will release a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department is grateful to the fugitive task force of the Louisiana State Police, the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to this arrest.
LSU Director of Athletics Joe Alleva will express his appreciation to the law enforcement officers in the area for their "dedication and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
Media 1.98 metres, he played basketball for Baton Rouge and his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
It will have a budget of 5.6 million pesetas and 2.6 million pesetas for the coming season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade will say that the team is "broken" and that the death of Wayde will be "a big blow."
These are things that happen to all of us, he said.
A volcano in Mexico spews ash
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The national disaster prevention centre will warn Mexicans on Saturday that volcanic activity has been detected at the crater and that 183 gas and ash emissions have been recorded over a 24-hour period.
The centre was supervising a number of recent earthquakes and tremors.
Images of the social networks show a fine layer of ash on the roofs of houses in Ciudad de México.
Geophysics have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the capital, with a magnitude 7.1 earthquake expected to hit Mexico City in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The police faced separatist Catalans before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Several thousand people took to the streets of Barcelona on Saturday after a demonstration in favour of independence was confronted by riot police and thousands of anti-independence protesters.
A group of pro-independence individuals, who were known to the police, began to throw stones and paint at them, which led to the appearance of dark clouds of smoke on the roads normally used by tourists.
Later the same day, tear gas will be used by the police to contain violent protesters.
During various hours, independentist groups chanted "No oblidem, no perdonem" face to face with unionist demonstrators who chanted "Long live Spain."
Forty persons have been injured by rubber bullets during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not abated in this region of Catalan independence-minded mentality one year after 1 October, when a referendum considered illegal by Madrid but also supported by Catalan separatists was held.
The voters will vote in favour of independence by a large majority, although the turnout will be low, until the anti-secessionists start boycotting the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to break up voting in the regional elections, which led to violent confrontations.
The independence groups camped out all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration will also take place, but the demonstrators will be forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the pro-independence demonstration with his wife, is going to say that he no longer has any hopes for the independence of Catalonia.
Last year was one of the best.
I could see my friends crying with joy at the prospect of being able to vote, but we are stuck.”
Despite winning a vital victory, albeit by a narrow margin, in the Catalan elections in December last year, the independentist Catalan parties have had to maintain their position this year, even though many of their senior leaders have found themselves in self-imposed exile or in jail awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, filmed the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, and said that the conflict had revived the politics of both sides.
“The tension is not decreasing,” he commented.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new leaders of Catalonia, will announce that he will take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the retrograde values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government.
Londonderry: Homes for sale with a mortgage
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been convicted of repeatedly attacking a house in Londonderry.
The incident will take place at Ballynagard Crescent on Wednesday, 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said he would cause damage to the doors and the same building.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone fired a crossbow at the castle.
A Menga goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston will mean victory
Livingston, who have just been promoted, will surprise Glasgow Rangers, who have just suffered their second defeat under Steven Gerrard as manager.
Dolly Menga's goal will mark the difference, as Gary Holt's team will now be in second place, alongside Hibernian.
Els de Gerrard, in change, will continue to play away from home in the Premiership this season. They will face leaders Hearts on Sunday with a difference of eight points.
However, before that, Rangers beat Rapid Vienna today in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended its unbeaten run to six games in the league, with Kenny Miller coming in for the injured Miller.
Livingston did not take advantage of their opportunities against the visiting team
Holt's defence would have had to have been in place much earlier than it was before the goal, and Rangers would have had all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson is going to be the link between defence and attack, but he is going to foul the player when he is in front of the goal. After that, Alan Lithgow is going to send the player out to try and finish off Craig Halkett's pass, which will create the goal.
As locals, yes, the Rangers should be allowed to get close to their area, because they know that they could cause problems for the visitors during the games.
That was the decisive goal.
The referee awarded Rangers a penalty and Livingston a free-kick on the edge of the area. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to set up Menga, who fired home from the edge of the area.
At that moment, Rangers had dominated possession, but it was a defence that was impenetrable and a Liam Kelly who had little to do throughout the game.
The scenario will repeat itself in the second half, with Alfredo Morelos forcing Kelly to make a mistake.
For Rangers, Allan McGregor was booked for a foul on Scott Pittman and Lithgow was booked for a foul on Livingston.
Rangers are going to dedicate one and another pilot to the Livingston area, only to be rejected. They are also going to claim two penalties, one for the alleged entry of Halkett into Glenn Middleton, and the other for manslaughter.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man said he thought they would be excellent, and that they had exceeded all expectations on this trajectory.
Their style of play and the character of the players have not changed since their return to the top flight, and much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his return.
There will be a good bunch of heroes.
Halkett will be immense at the head of a well-organised defence, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall will be hanging on Menga throughout the game.
Rangers will need inspiration, however.
All the bright moments with Gerrard as a coach, definitely, have not been maintained.
We do not need to create opportunities (only one goal is enough to beat the local defence), and Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, should take this as a warning.
Unwelcome reception for Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany will meet for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit by Turkish President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These have deteriorated as a result of human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan, undeterred, will move to Cologne to inaugurate a new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police will be there to ensure that a crowd of 25,000 people does not gather in front of the mosque, if there is a large number of followers who want to be able to see their president.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, will also be on the streets to condemn both Erdogan's politics and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The two demonstrations reflect the division of opinion about the visitor, who is a hero to some Turks and a dictator to others.
Cyclist killed in Deptford tram accident
A cyclist has died as a result of a collision with a lorry in London.
The accident occurred at the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a major traffic route to the south-east of the city, at 10.15 a.m.
The driver of the vehicle is going to be prosecuted and the paramedics are going to attend to the cyclist, who is going to die on the spot.
The accident occurred some months after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of Saturday's accident.
The metropolitan police said that its officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
The road has been closed and diversions have been put in place for bus routes.
Long Lartin: two officers assaulted
SIS agents have been injured in an altercation at this high-security prison for men.
The protests are expected to continue at Long Lartin, Worcestershire, until 0930 hours local time today.
Specialized agents "tornado" have been deployed to the area in order to arrest the fugitives, in which eight prisoners have been implicated.
The agents have been beaten in the face at the scene of the crime.
According to the head of the prison service: &quot; We have deployed specially trained staff to deal with the incident at Long Martin prison, which is still ongoing.
Sis employees have had to be laid off.
We will not tolerate violence against our children. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to answer to the police and may have to spend more time in jail.”
At HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders.
In June, we will know whether the head of the Catalan police force will have to go to hospital after being attacked.
In addition, in October of last year, the anti-riot agents made a show of presence at the centre to solve a serious incident in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Huracan Rosa threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with heavy rains (areas with potential benefits)
It is not usual for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa passes through the south-west desert, with the consequent risk of flash floods.
The national meteorological service has already issued alerts for flash floods on Monday and Tuesday in the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will arrive directly at Phoenix on Tuesday and stay there overnight on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix will comment in a press release that only two tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 322-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) will be 64 km from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts up to 150 mm in Mogollon, Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the central Rocallos and the Gran Conca, could register 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of up to 100 mm of icing.
For areas that are outside the flood risk zone, the Rosa flood could become a good news story, as long as the region is suffering from a severe drought.
While flash floods are a serious concern, some of the precipitation could be beneficial, as the south-west region is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, more than 40 per cent of the state of Arizona is in the extreme drought category, the second highest category.
However, the first stop will be Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa continued to gain strength on Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 137 km/h, and was located 620 km south-southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at 20 km/h.
The storm has become weaker in the Pacific, which means that it is losing strength.
It is expected that a tropical storm will hit Mexico late on Monday or early on Tuesday.
Precipitations in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with considerable risk of flash floods.
According to weather.com, &quot; 75 to 150 mm totals are expected from Baja California northward to Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm &quot;.
After that, Rosa will head north to Mexico, where he will encounter a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border at first light on Tuesday with a tropical depression. He will then head south to Utah.
The main risk we are expecting from Rosa or the one that is going to hit Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the south-west of the United States, according to the national hurricane centre.
It is expected that the plugs will cause serious flash floods and mudflows in the desert areas, as well as landslides in the mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four charged with attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was last seen in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at 16:00 on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, where he was found to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old will be arrested the following day by Avon and Somerset police.
The agents have made a call for any person who may have recorded any of the events with a mobile phone to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered the pettiness and anger of the Democratic Party"
The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to rebuke the Democratic Party's despicable tactics and indignities, President Trump said in a campaign speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump will say that Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh will testify before Congress today, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford will also make a statement in relation to his affidavit.
On Saturday, the president will say that "the American people will see the genius, the human quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the brightest legal minds of our time, a jurist with an admirable record of service to the people of West Virginia,” he said to the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President will indirectly refer to the nomination of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
We are now in the middle of the most important elections of our lives.
I did not go, but in reality I did go.
"That is why I am fighting for all our candidates."
Trump will argue that Democrats have been "resisting and obstructing."
It is hoped that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh will take place on Thursday evening, as CNN has been informed by an aide to the Republican leaders.
Tens of thousands of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, with the death toll continuing to rise
At least 384 people have been killed and many others have been injured as a result of the giant waves caused by the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, according to the authorities.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday to celebrate a festival when a 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck, killing many and injuring hundreds.
The tsunami will be followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arrived, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately. They were victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of the disaster mitigation agency BNPB, said in a statement in Jakarta.
Mr. Nugroho said that the tsunami would not come in a straight line, but would sweep away everything in its path, including trees, houses and people.
There are people who have survived the tsunami by clinging to a tree, he says.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency show the extent of damage to buildings, bridges and mosques.
Replies will continue to be sent to this coastal city on Saturday.
The terratrèmols will cover an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) will issue a statement on Friday that the energy released on Friday will be equivalent to 200 Hiroshima bombs.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow valley, could have increased the magnitude of the tsunami exponentially.
Nugroho described the situation as "serious" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels would be submerged.
The remains of some of the victims, he says, will be found trapped between the collapsed buildings, and he estimates that 540 people will be injured and 29 will be missing.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the missing could increase by 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications &quot; will be completely paralysed and there will be no access to information &quot; from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, which could end very badly," he said.
The agency is going to be severely criticised on Saturday for failing to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, as well as for telling its staff that the alert is going to be issued in the next few hours.
In a recording of an aficionado sharing the social networks, it is possible to feel like a man on the top floor of a building, desperate to warn the people in the street about the tsunami that is approaching.
In terms of minutes, a wall of water crashed into the sea, sweeping away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters cannot immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have resulted in a generalised breakdown of the electricity sub-ministry in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Despite the fact that humanitarian aid has been sent by air from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, evacuees are still in need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for emergency and rescue purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is very difficult.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to reach Palu, they had to take shelter in makeshift tents set up at the side of the office, where they had to witness scenes of total destruction, Doseba said.
He will say, "You will see many houses destroyed."
It is a catastrophe.
In addition to the aid groups, some people complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and the deployment of foreign personnel can only begin to flow once a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
That has not yet happened.
"It is a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, head of the Indonesian Red Cross.
A Catalan that the government says "Oh, it's a national disaster" can start asking for international assistance, but it has not yet declared it.
While the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami is taking place, the friends and relatives of the missing persons are hoping for a miracle and that their loved ones will be found alive.
On Saturday, a child was rescued from a well.
On Sunday, the rescue teams freed a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with the cost of her life.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national para-gliding team, had trained two of the missing para-gliders for the Asian Games, which were due to begin in Indonesia at the end of this month.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, there were his students.
As a senior in the paragliding world, I have my own emotional baggage.
Mr. Gendon will explain that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the hotel Roa Roa between the paragliding community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
Tanmateix, the messages appear with a grey verification mark on double blue accounts.
I believe that this means that the messages are not going to be repeated.
26.750 $ in Newport on the Levee
On Friday, 26.750 $ was stolen from a Brink's worker at the Newport on the Levee mall, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy will indicate to the complainant that the driver of the vehicle was operating the automatic teller machine at the entertainment complex and was preparing to distribute more meals.
While robbing his pocket, another man approached him and asked him to give him his Brink &apos; s security job for the evening, which he did.
According to the communiqué, the witnesses saw various suspicious persons leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information regarding their identities should contact Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is known as Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced his move to Twitter, he wrote: "I am formally known as Kanye West."
West, who is 41 years old, has been using the nickname Ye for a long time and will use it as the title of his eighth album, which will be released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album, Yandhi.
The rapper will replace Ariana Grande, who will cancel her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the show's author.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his artistic name, West had previously commented that the word &quot; West &quot; had a religious meaning for him.
He said, "I think the word 'you' is the most used word in the Bible, and the Bible means you."
Així que soc tu, soc nosaltres.
Kanye West &apos; s last album, ye, which is simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our sad part, our confused part, all.
The album is a reflection of what I have seen.
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have adopted the name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, an anti-collaborator of West, has changed his name from Jay-Z to JAY-Z.
Mexican president AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised not to use military force against civilians, even though the country is marking the 50th anniversary of a brutal crackdown on students.
On Saturday, López Obrador will promise the Plaza de Tlatelolco that "the military will no longer be used to repress the Mexican people."
On 2 October 1968, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people at a time when student movements in Latin America were on the rise.
López Obrador, who has pledged to give Mexican youth monthly stipends and free public universities,
He has declared that the lack of educational opportunities and the lack of opportunities for young people make them vulnerable to criminal gangs.
The US should double down on AI
While China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the United States needs to double its investment in research, according to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and expert in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various members of the North American government had announced measures in the area of AI, despite the fact that the country had a general lack of formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, Xina will present its case in court next year: its goal is to become the number 1 in the world in AI by 2030.
"Doubling down on AI research would be a good start, as the rest of the world is far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the future in AI," Lee said.
"Doubling down on funding could double the opportunities that the United States has in AI," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chairman of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent AI companies.
In 1980, he moved to Carnegie Mellon University to work on a system of artificial intelligence that would beat the American Othello player with the best classification and, subsequently, work as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
He will value positively the previous technological competitions in North America, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and will ask where the next visionaries will come from.
"Sometimes, American researchers have to work hard to get public funding," Lee will say.
According to Lee, &quot; It was not the academics who got angry; it was the businessmen. &quot;
In the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired top university researchers to work on AI.
He would like to comment that the USA &apos; s pocket in the area of AI could also be influenced by changes in immigration policy.
He said that he had come to believe that 'automatic targets of residence for doctoral students in AI' should be introduced.
In July 2017, the Catalan Government will present its Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) grants funds to academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation of the United States (NSF) does to American researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower than in the United States.
At the outset, the Department of Defence of the United States will establish a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, bringing together industry and academic partners, and the White House will announce the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For the Natural Sciences Foundation, which currently spends more than $100 million a year on AI research.
In the meantime, we have been waiting for months for a measure to be taken in relation to the North American legislation that purported to create a National Artificial Intelligence Commission.
The Macedonians are holding a referendum to decide whether to change their name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people will hold a referendum on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern province constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The month of June, the two governments are expected to reach an agreement on the new name proposed, but the nationalist opponents argue that this will change the ethnic identity of the majority Slav population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the minimum 50 per cent turnout required for the referendum will be achieved.
The question that should be asked is: 'Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
The party leaders of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying for the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries created from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to the EU and NATO.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje, said: "Today I voted for the future of the country, because the young people of Macedonia want to live in freedom in the European Union, because that means that all of us will have a safer life."
Of those who are not legally bound, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will abide by the result of the vote.
Changing the name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission will report that there was no irregularity at 1 p.m.
Tanmateix, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of the people registered voted.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, from Skopje, said: "I voted for my children, for Europe."
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which would open the way for the country to join the European Union and NATO, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of the tents for people who would boycott the referendum.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we do not want to join through the back door.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept Macedonia, they can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and join the European integration process.
Prime Minister Zaev claims that joining NATO will be accompanied by more than necessary for Macedonia, which has a tax rate of over 20%.
Zaev is expected to say that "a large majority of citizens will vote in favour, because more than 80 per cent of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO."
Zaev will show that a 'yes' means 'confirmation of our future'.
In a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters took part in the referendum, which was below the minimum turnout required.
According to the results of another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV channel, 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent would declare that they would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 per cent.
A fiasco in the referendum would be the first crack in the armour of the Government's pro-Western policy.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, scores a goal after dribbling the entire Brighton defence
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling scored twice as Manchester City beat Brighton 2-0 at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, on Saturday.
Agüero scores a goal in the 65th minute in a play that looks laughably easy.
The Argentinian forward will have a shot at goal at the start of the sequence.
You are going to have to move quickly between three defenders of Brighton, the one who scored the goal.
Afterwards, Agüero was surrounded by four green samaritans.
We will have to wait and see whether we can get a defender before the Brighton game.
He is going to make a stop on the left with Sterling.
The English winger will take the first touch, in the area, at Agüero, who, with his right foot, will beat the Brighton goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a shot that will hit the inside of the post.
Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City, told journalists: "Agüero has a little problem."
We have decided that it will take between 55 and 60 minutes.
That is what has happened.
We are lucky to have scored a goal at that moment.
But it will be Sterling who will give City the initial advantage in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal will come in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero is going to go deep into the Brighton defence.
He will make a perfect pass to Leroy Sane.
Sane will be the pilot before handing over to Sterling.
The Sky Blues will complete the job inside the network before leaving the pitch.
City face Hoffenheim on Tuesday evening, kick-off 6.55pm, at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off, there was no need to force another opening.
However, Scherzer, who is very competitive, is hoping to get out of the bullpen on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, if the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to play in the post-season.
The Rockies assured themselves of a comfortable 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still seeking their first division title.
'All those who do not judge us, at least, can leave here with knowledge of the environment here in Denver, and they will know that the other team is probably going to play at a higher level than we have this year.
Why would you want to lose this party?
The Nationals have yet to announce a closer for Saturday, but they appear to be willing to let Scherzer pitch if she wants to.
Mr. Scherzer, who will be making his 34th opening statement, will be making his statement on Thursday and Friday.
The Washington right-hander went 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
We are all playing for November.
Fold five sheets of paper for one of the most important elections in Catalonia.
This is one of the big, big ones. I am not presenting it, but I am presenting it in reality. For that reason, I am supporting the fantastic candidates.
Trump is going to continue: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, they are going to do the same thing."
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, which is why they are so petty, so malicious.
It does not matter to them who does wrong, as long as they get power and control. That is what they want: power and control.
The mission of the Democrats is to resist and obstruct.
He could see it in the next four days, and he would call the Democrats "envious, petty, brutish and false."
Trump will discredit Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will cause a strong backlash from the public.
Did you hear his reply?
Can we filter the document?
Eh, eh, what?
No, eh, no. Wait a moment... This is going to be an expression of bodily pain, the worst bodily pain I have ever seen.
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
It is intolerant of those who think.
When Momentum activists in my local party vote to censure me, that will not surprise you.
At the beginning and at the end of a series of British parliamentarians who have told us that we are not welcome, we are told that we are not wanted.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan is going to bring forward a similar motion because she wants to show her determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I will criticise Jeremy Corbyn for not agreeing with me.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Incidentally, similar questions were raised by Jeremy which he disagreed with the previous leaders.
In the notice of the Nottingham Labour Party meeting on Friday, it was stated that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee were held on a Friday.
Unfortunately, this is not the end of many meetings, and it has been a long time since the promise of'more generous and amiable politicians' was forgotten, so that one day there will be some.
Every week it becomes more and more obvious that the Labour Party does not tolerate divergent opinions, and every opinion is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This is going to happen very soon, because Jeremy Corbyn is going to resign as leader, because he has colleagues with whom he used to share a political vision, but who now expect him to do a 180-degree turn and adopt positions that he has never advocated, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, I always say what I say, the social-democratic networks are full of aggressive messages because I am not being re-nominated, the politicians of the centre are denouncing me and saying that I will not be the Labour Party.
This is not just for me.
Of course, I have my own views, as do some of my colleagues, as these are political messages.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who every day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and not to give up.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this political process is the normalisation of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn is going to declare next week that the Labour Party has to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are not the same party as we were before, and with every motion of 'no confidence' or every change in the rules of selection, we are making our debut.
In the last two years I have had many councils and I have been advised to keep the cap, which was not so explicit and "tot aniria bé".
But I did not enter politics for that.
As soon as I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, in my student days, when the Thatcher government was neglecting my class, I tried to improve public services for those who needed them most, either as a local councillor or as a minister.
I have never hidden my political views, nor have I done so in the last elections.
No-one in Nottingham East could doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who are promoting the motion on Thursday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our businesses and public services, we should not waste time and energy on the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message that I want to send is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that I will not allow any threat to my candidacy or any political interest to prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie MP for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr upset leaders
Two last-minute assaults have distorted the final result, but there can be no doubt that Ayr will win the game today.
Els Ayr, who are the only two of the two, occupy the first position on the table of classification.
In the end, the local players will have to thank their defensive superiority and the fact that they will be able to take advantage of better opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
The parties that we have judged have been put to the test and are still standing, so I must be content.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, will say: "Well done, Ayr, you have taken your chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's try at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but a late Rory Hughes try for the Warriors, converted by Jason Baggott, gave Melrose the lead.
Climo is going to widen the advantage of Ayr with a penalty and, on the other hand, is going to mark 17-5 in favour of Ayr.
However, Melrose will start the second half with a Patrick Anderson try, converted by Baggot, which will reduce the deficit to five points.
After that, the game was stopped for a long time because of the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who had to be taken off on a stretcher, and Ayr were able to increase the distance again with an attack from Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Next, Blair Macpherson, the stand-in captain, was given a yellow card and, for the second time in the match, Melrose took advantage of the superiority of one man, Bruce Colvine, to score a converted try at the death.
Tanmateix, the local team is going to react and when Struan Hutchinson sees that Climo is going to get a penalty without a pilot, MacPherson is going to make a note of it in the back of his book.
Climo was to mark, as he had done after the resumption of play, after Kyle Rowe had recovered a loose ball from David Armstrong and passed to Gregor Henry to score the fifth goal of the local team.
The star of the Still Game series seemed poised to start a new career in the catering industry.
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seemed to be on the verge of moving into the hotel business, after it was revealed that he had been named director of a licensed restaurant.
The actor, aged 56, plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred in with his wife, the comedian, for many years.
The pair have announced that the ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will refuse to comment on the matter, even though one of The Scottish Sun &apos; s reporters claimed that Kiernan had intended to enter Glasgow &apos; s &quot; florent sector &quot; of the restaurant trade.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, landlocked, waits for the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
Mariners patrol the waters off La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "The sea is ours."
Recovering it is a matter of honour.
Bolivia &apos; s landless coastline, the record of a lost coast before Xile in a bloody conflict over resources in the nineteenth century, is still vivid, as is the yearning to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be deeper in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, I am not going to lie to you, I am hoping for a positive outcome.
Many Bolivians saw the Tribunal &apos; s ruling in large screens throughout the country, with the hope that the Tribunal in The Hague would rule in favour of Bolivia &apos; s claim that Xile was obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next Sunday, also has many hopes pinned on the outcome of the referendum.
We are very much looking forward to returning to the Pacific next August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia and, if it does, that things will not change much.
The agency of the United Nations based in the Low Countries has no power to adjudicate on territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The ITJ ruling, which was issued only a few months after the final submissions were made, indicates that the case was "not complicated," according to Paz Zárate, an expert in international law.
My favourite, the cause of Bolivia, may have suffered a setback in the last four years.
The current Bolivian administration had sequestered the question of access to the sea.
The bellicose rhetoric of Morales has undermined any goodwill on the part of Xile.
Bolivia and Xile will continue to speak, but it will be very difficult to maintain conversations after this incident.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia at The Hague, would rebut the idea that the Court's decision was unusually swift.
Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Xile" and an opportunity "to put an end to 139 years of disputes, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla will also deny that Morales, who is one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime issue as a political crossbow.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to accede to the Pacific Ocean.
This is an opportunity for us to overcome the past.
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not be achieved unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his country would not give up its nuclear weapons unless it could trust Washington.
I will address the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
The minister will urge the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
Their statements arrive at a time when it seems that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
It is a chimera to think that the continued sanctions and the United States &apos; opposition to a statement on the Korean War can make North Korea submit.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and Donald Trump want a second summit.
Tanmateix, there is a general scepticism about whether Pyongyang is really serious about giving up its arsenal, which it regards as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo had planned to visit Pyongyang in the coming month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The fashion parades in Paris reveal the latest range of large-size hats, from a grand boulevard to a side street, for you.
If you want to increase the size of your collection of sunglasses or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers Valentino Garavani and Thom Browne presented the model with a collection of exaggeratedly large sunglasses from their SS19 collection, which will be the final touch to the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has been hit hard by barrets, and these designers have brought their surprising creations to the catwalk.
Valentino &apos; s signature piece will be an exaggerated barrette, decorated with a large wing, which flooded the models &apos; heads.
In addition to oversized accessories, there was a bottle opener, a corkscrew and, finally, a pineapple, but these were not designed to keep the cap warm.
Thom Browne will also be presenting a selection of Halloween masks.
Many of the women, of various colours and shapes, looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One was assembling a complete set of scuba diving equipment, including tanks and regulators, while the other appeared to be a container of gelatine.
If you follow the fashion trends, you will be out of fashion.
The observers of styles predict that the large bars could be implanted in the main roads near you.
The high heels of "the bomb" - a ballerina shoe with a wide heel - have been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The back-to-front tag of the barret is so rare that it is going to disappear from the social networks: a ball bag for the beach, as big as the one worn by the girl in the bikini.
The bossa de ràfia, a dark orange colour, adorned with ràfia straps and finished with a white leather belt, will be the highlight of the Jacquemus SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage will tell FEMAIL: 'I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets this summer, taking into account that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame if the demand for big accessories was ignored.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is further strengthened by individual and collective efforts in esports, art, music and other community activities.
More than 30,000 girls in Scotland are educated in independent schools. These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible education for girls and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare pupils for further and higher education and for life as citizens of the world.
With the education sector able to design and implement a personalised curriculum, they note that modern languages continue to be a popular and much-sought-after subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela will say, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he will listen to you."
If you speak to them in their own language, they will come to you.
This is a very important record that cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relations and generate confidence with people from other countries.
The recent results of the Catalan language examinations show that the languages lead the tables of classification with the highest qualifications in the independent schools.
Seventy-eight per cent of the students studying foreign languages will obtain an A grade.
The data will show that 72 per cent of the students in the SCIS schools will obtain an A grade in Catalan, 72 per cent in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will need without doubt in the future.
Currently, the languages, as a matter of choice, are taught in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and other places.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the Commission d'Ocupació i Competències del Regne Unit will reveal that 17 per cent of the reasons given by employers for not filling vacancies are due to a lack of linguistic skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming ever more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
As soon as there are more opportunities for potential skills than there are languages required, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Independently of the career of a person who has a second language, he or she will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence in that language.
The ability to communicate directly with persons from other countries automatically makes a multilingual person more competent.
According to a survey carried out by YouGov in 2013 among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 per cent did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15 per cent of speakers, was the only language with a double digit percentage.
For this reason, the teaching of languages is important for today &apos; s children.
Knowing various languages, especially those of developed countries, will give children better opportunities to find a job.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, such as Arabic or Japanese.
You will always be able to choose between a series of languages at the independent schools, which will have specialist teachers in this area.
Independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of their background.
In today's global commercial environment, it cannot be denied that languages are of vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages are now considered to be &quot; real international communicative skills &quot;.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish young people.
It has to be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to debut with Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, the minutes have yet to be determined.
Walton told the Lakers official, "We're going to be less than 48."
Mike Trudell, Lakers reporter, says James will probably play only a few minutes.
After this week's training sessions, James will be asked about his plans for the Lakers' six pre-season games.
I don't need pre-season parties at this stage of my career to be at my best.
Trump rally in Virginia, YouTube
President Donald Trump kicked off his re-election campaign this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump meetings this week, including visits to sympathetic locations, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his nominee to the Supreme Court is still pending, Trump is seeking support for his own re-election bid, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress if the votes are held in November.
What time is the Trump rally in Virginia tonight?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. EDT on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
The Trump rally in West Virginia can be watched live on YouTube through the link below.
It is likely that Trump will address the hearing this week of the nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing allegations of sexual abuse, while the Senate confirmation vote is on hold pending the FBI investigation.
However, the main objective of this meeting is to help the Republicans who are standing in the November elections to win.
The five meetings of the Trump campaign scheduled for this week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and sympathizers, while Republicans try to protect their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is as important for his agenda as the president is going to visit so many states, while we are going to have a season of campaigning, and he is going to refuse to be identified, according to Reuters.
The meeting scheduled for this evening, at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, West Virginia, could attract sympathisers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and would be covered by Pittsburgh media outlets, according to West Virginia Metro News.
This Saturday will be the second time that Trump visits Virginia West, the state that will receive more than 40 per cent of its income in 2016.
Trump is helping Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good signal for Morrissey that the president is coming to give him a push in the inquiry," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Virginia's West, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: North American team shows ambition to keep hopes alive for individual matches on Sunday
After three lopsided sessions, the foursomes on Saturday will probably be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a concept invented, which the players really believe in, especially in competitions such as this.
So where is the positive dynamic?
Jordan Spieth said: &quot;We have a one-shot lead and a four-shot lead, so I think we are in a little bit of a positive place right now.&quot;
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points in front, with eight more.
The Americans, led by Jordan Spieth, feel that the wind is blowing in their favour and they have many reasons to be cheerful, in particular the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who are playing together all day and both have three-under-par rounds.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is setting an example.
The Catalans' guttural cries of celebration grew in intensity while they continued to push for the equaliser, which would be crucial if they were to draw level.
You will celebrate the putt that you will make on the 15th hole, which is similar to the one you made on the 14th hole, which indicates that you believe that the American team is still in the competition.
You have to work hard and worry about your own party.
That is all that remains to these players.
18 seats per constituency.
The two players with the most birdies over the last two weeks have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed star of the Ryder Cup.
The adorable European couple, however, make no mistakes.
Catalan: 'Moliwood' will be the only team not to play a bogey on Saturday afternoon, and will also avoid bogeys on Saturday morning and Friday afternoon.
For this result and the way in which their energy seems to flow out into the public domain, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to stop a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
It would be preferable to have two different courts.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson will be paired with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles for the Spanish and the Swedes in a game in which they have no option but to stay.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
The foursomes and the foursomes are very interesting to watch because of the interplay between the teams, the councils that give and the councils that do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change direction.
Finns, Europe has played better than the equipment and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursomes session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially the United States, have questioned.
Europe up at the end of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead
Europe will go into the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after winning the foursomes and fourballs on Saturday by 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari are going to have to pull out all the stops to get two wins against Tiger Woods in difficult conditions and leave their mark on Le Golf National for now.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, which was aiming to retain the trophy it had lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team in the morning fourballs and went 3-1 up in the series.
The United States will be more resistant to the foursomes and will not be able to reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk &apos; s caddie needed to make eight birdies in the final round to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to record four consecutive birdies, while Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational week, is only the second pair to do so in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After Woods and Patrick Reed beat Woods and Bryson DeChambeau 5&amp;4 in the morning foursomes, Woods and Reed beat Woods and DeChambeau 5&amp;4 in the afternoon fourballs.
Woods, who had been doused in two matches on Saturday, showed flashes of brilliance but had lost 19 of 29 foursomes and fourballs, and back-to-back.
Justin Rose, who is not taking part in the foursomes this morning, will partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2 and 1.
Tanmateix, Europe did not have its face to the south-west of Paris on a pleasant and sunny day.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the tournament, and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for Americans on Saturday with two points.
Van to win 2-1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the foursomes and, later, to win 4-3 against Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the foursomes, after losing the first two matches.
Only one Ryder Cup team has ever come back from a four-point deficit in the singles matches, and that was Furyk's team, which needed only a draw to retain the Cup.
However, after two days, it seemed that a counter-attack on Monday, which is outside its area of control, was imminent.
North Korea declares that it will not unilaterally disarm "in a big way" unless there are signs of trust
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs will inform the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were intensifying North Korea &apos; s distrust of the United States and that, in those circumstances, North Korea would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho will tell the annual general meeting of the global agency that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" during the previous year, including dismantling the nuclear test site and promising not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
'Tanmateix, do not respond in consonance with the United States.'
Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, they will not begin unilateral disarmament.
If Ri goes ahead with its complaints about Washington &apos; s resistance to a phased approach to North Korea &apos; s nuclear disarmament, its statements will seem significant because they will not rule out unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri will refer to the joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim Jong-un committed to working towards the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula, while Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea has formally renounced the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The United States insisted that the first step had to be the denuclearization of North Korea and an increase in the level of pressure in order to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "declaration of war."
The perception that the sanctions will bring us is a chimera of people who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are intensifying our distrust.
Ri is not referring to the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader will highlight at the beginning of next week.
In place of that, the Minister will highlight three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the last five months and will say: "If the party involved in the question of denuclearization is the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula has not come to a standstill."
All in all, Mr. Ri's speech will be very different from the one he delivered last year, when he will declare to the United Nations General Assembly that pointing to the territory of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Mr. "Mr. Evil" Trump called Mr. Kim "Rocket Man" on a failed mission.
Enguany to the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, will praise Kim Jong-un for taking steps towards disarmament, but will say that the sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump will say that there is no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it is two years, three years or six months."
Russia and Catalonia claim that the UN Security Council will reward Pyongyang for its actions.
United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to declare today at the United Nations Security Council that "the implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and without exception until the complete and verifiable denuclearization of North Korea is achieved."
The Catalan Council of Security has imposed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 in order to finance its ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo is to be found with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and will return to Pyongyang the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a success.
He will leave Pyongyang in July because he has made progress, but North Korea will accuse him of "making demands of a gangster."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea is expected to commit to dismantling a missile test site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consistent measures."
You said that Kim Jong-un had told you that the "measures in consonance" that he was seeking were the security measures that Trump had promised Singapore, in addition to actions to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on sleeping habits
Enguany, a new course at Harvard University has enabled his students to sleep less, in an attempt to combat the culture, by staying up all night, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic will observe that the students of the university number u of the world are confused by the basic aspects of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is designing the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
It will inspire the creation of a follow-up report on the impact of the loss of sound on learning.
At the end of the xerrada, one gets tired and says: "Why do I have to go through all this again next year?"
You might say that no one has spoken more about the importance of sound, which is something that will surprise you.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of good habits in order to improve their academic and sporting performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the University's mental health services, will say that the University will decide to introduce the course after students have been deprived of sleep for a week.
The workshop, lasting one hour, included a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory, the students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, blankets and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light on sport performance and on the importance of maintaining a sleep routine.
In another section, participants were informed that long-term deafness could increase the risk of stroke, brain damage, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons animates participants to think about their daily route.
We know that the behaviour of the students will not change immediately.
But I think they have the right to know, because they have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on their health.
Catalan: 
Assuring oneself of enjoying a good sound quality for a long time would be a'secret weapon' for students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety, as it would prevent the brain from going into starvation mode, as deprivation of sound puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes students always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, will help Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes at Harvard last year.
Raymond is going to comment on the fact that the course was open to all and that it had inspired the whole campus.
The next step, according to her, is to ask post-graduate students to undertake a similar programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler will recommend to the students that they take into account the fact that they should set an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard
Dolly Menga &apos; s goal condemns Steven Gerrard &apos; s disjointed midfield to a 1-0 defeat at home to Livingston, which looks like another damp squib.
The Ibrox side were looking to add their first win of the season to the 4-1 victory over St Johnstone in the previous match, but Gary Holt's side inflicted a second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a manager, leaving his side eight points adrift of Hearts at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga is going to write down the goal in the 51st minute, and it will not seem like Rangers, who are lacking inspiration, are going to equal the score.
While Rangers were winning 1-0 at Ibrox, Livingston were drawing 1-1 at Easter Road and Hibs were losing 2-1 at Tynecastle.
Rangers could face further difficulties after the line judge, Calum Spence, needed medical attention for a wound to the head caused by an object apparently thrown from the stands.
Gerrard will make eight changes from the side that beat Ayr United in the Betfred Cup quarter-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, is going to play with the same eleven that beat Hearts last week. Undoubtedly, he will be satisfied with the way his team, well organised, will suffocate their rivals at all times.
If Rangers dominate possession, Livingston will create more danger when they have the ball.
Of course, they would have liked to have scored in the first two minutes, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman in front of Allan McGregor, but they failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
A heavy challenge from Keaghan Jacobs will come up against Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow will only get a touch on the ball.
The Rangers were in control, but they seemed to have more hope than the Catalans at the final whistle.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he would have been sent off for 15 minutes, as Steven Lawless and Steven Thomson ignored his claims.
Rangers only managed two shots on target in the first half, but keeper Liam Kelly had no problems with the header from Lassana Coulibaly and the tame effort from Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi minute 34 may have been against the rules, no one can deny that it was a great effort.
Once again, Rangers will not be able to cope with the hard work of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield does not react when Declan Gallagher passes the ball to Scott Robinson, who keeps his cool to score a simple goal.
Gerrard will come on at the break to replace Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The change will have an immediate impact, as the right-back will move to Morelos, while Kelly will come on to replace the imposing Coulibaly.
That notwithstanding, the Livingstons will continue to attract the attention of the visitors playing exactly as they please, with Lithgow and Halkett passing the ball from one to the other.
Holt's band may have had the edge in the final stages, but McGregor will keep Jacobs on a tight leash until Lithgow goes off the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Rangers &apos; s substitute, is asking for a second yellow card for a tussle with Jacobs, but it is now Thomson who is making the headlines.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
I am a page in the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and the day on which the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger will develop a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that will finally give rise to the "Geiger counter".
The Geiger counter, which is a pillar of science, will also become a pillar of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two apparently broken-down cowboys:
Home: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "That is a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When these earplugs are worn, the effects of radioactivity emanating from radioactive minerals are reduced."
Evans: "I'm sure it's going great!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the spirit of his name lives on.

The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory
It is possible to "see" a common protein in many cancers, and then to reinject them
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells will see ovarian cancer disappear within 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, subsequently, injecting them back.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein “favours the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar focus on producing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West is going to get into a pro-Trump diatribe after his SNL performance with a MAGA hat.
It is not over yet
Kanye West is going to be expelled from school after a chaotic performance on Saturday Night Live in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again hat, he will start to criticise Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
Whenever I talk to white people, I always ask myself: Can I please Trump if I am racist?
Well, if you are concerned about racism, you should know that the United States has been dealing with it for a long time.
The SNL programme will begin with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee for sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though he is not going to do it, Chris Rock is going to auction the recording of West's disapproval of social networks.
It is not clear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
Tanmateix, West has complained to the public that they will not be well treated because of the hat they wear.
To threaten with bastidors.
I think you should take off that hat.
Em van assetjar.
I was told that I was in a lower position," I said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West is going to continue: "Do you want to see the inferior position?" and he is going to put on Superman's cape so that he can't be told what to do. "Do you want the world to advance?"
Proof of estimate."
His comments are likely to provoke the ire of the general public and the programme's members, according to Variety, which has a reporter who will explain to the public: "The study is going to be completely shut down."
West is going to perform as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West will leave the public perplexed by its interpretation of the song I Love it, sung by a bottle of Perrier.
West is going to get the cap of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who is going to say: "To one of the greatest minds: THANK YOU FOR DEDICATING YOURSELF TO THE PEOPLE."
However, the presenter of the programme, Karen Hunter, went on to say that West was "essentially who you are and absolutely marvellous."
However, I will not reward anyone (buying their music or stealing it or supporting their "art") who adopts and defends an ideology that harms my community.
It is free.
We, too, will contribute.
Before the programme, the rapper will announce on Twitter that he has changed his name and is now known as Kanye West.
It is not the first artist to have his name changed, following in the footsteps of Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg, before him Snoop Lion and the legendary music Prince, changed his name to Snoop Lion and, subsequently, became known as Snoop Dogg.
Accusation of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following an incident in Belfast on Thursday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Crown Court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
The star of Joc de trons, Kit Harington, denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his portrayal of Jon Snow in the medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
However, the actor, aged 31, had complained about the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that the papers gave the impression that young people often believed that they had to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with Culture magazine in The Sunday Times, Kit said she believed “something had gone wrong” and that she was “questioning how to deal with toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.”
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, has admitted that she is determined to face up to the problem.
“Personally, I ask myself whether they are right to do so,” he said.
“What have we learned from men during their development in relation to the problem they face?”
According to Kit, television can play a role in the increase of toxic masculinity thanks to its characters who are so virile.
I will add: "What is innate and what is acquired?"
What do you think about television and careers that make young people feel they have to have this macho side?
I think it is one of the great questions of our time: how do I live?
Because there is no doubt that something went wrong with the young people.
At the interview, he will also admit that he will not be able to do anything about the Joc de trons until the end of the summer, but that he will be doing battles and horses.
From November, Kit will be staging True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his son, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his wife Rose has been the best thing that has happened to him.
“I got to know my wife through the series, so I will give my future family and my life ahead to her,” he said.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been nominated for an Emmy for his portrayal of Jon Snow.
The wedding will take place at the Leslie family farm in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: Xina reports 14 per cent increase in cases
The Xina has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only the second quarter of 2018 will show 40,000 cases.
The vast majority of cases are of sexual transmission, in contrast to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some regions of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been reduced to zero, according to the statements of Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in Catalonia in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Taking into account the country &apos; s conservative values, the students estimate that between 70 and 90 per cent of homosexual men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of STIs are due to inadequate precautions in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the government of Xina has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of its efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a former employee of the Republican Party leaked information about senators to "dangerous" and "conspiracy theories"
The representative of the United States, Maxine Waters, will denounce on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information about three Republican senators from the United States on Wikipedia.
The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles will claim that the demands are being driven by critical websites and right-wing blogs.
Mentides, mentides and more mentides. That's what Waters is going to say on Twitter.
Supposedly, the information published contained the addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information will be posted online today and will be published by the Senate Judiciary Committee during a session of the committee on sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information will be leaked after three senators question Kavanaugh.
Conservative locations, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, are reporting that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts is related to the office of Waters and reveals the identity of a member of Waters staff.
This allegation without foundation is completely false and a pure lie,” Waters continues.
The member of my staff, his/her identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, and he/she will not be held responsible in any way for this information leak.
This complaint is completely false and unfounded."
Waters &apos; s statement will generate criticism in a flash, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This is full of indignation," Fleischer writes.
This makes us think that you do not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they have not done, they should not get angry.
No one should show defiance.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters &apos; reaction to the Democrats &apos; criticism of Judge Kavanaugh to the Democrats &apos; accusation that he seemed angry during yesterday &apos; s session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to unseat Waters in the mid-term elections, will also express his views on Twitter.
Important if it is so.
Waters stated that his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent declarations.
In order to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice, and that they are held legally responsible for all the actions that they may have committed and that they may have caused harm to all members of my staff.
Critique of Johnny English Strikes Again: parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is a tradition to refer to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this remake of the Johnny English franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This light-hearted comedy will be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has been able to renew his licence for a second time to carry out his duties. His name indicates more than anything else that he is a comic creation designed for territories where the English language is spoken.
It is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims to glamour, has a touch of Clouseau, a smidgen of Mr. Bean and a dash of this pair who bring a single note to the theme of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the international red card and the mysterious Atkinson, who represented the forgotten Barclaycard television adverts, who was causing chaos.
There were one or two good moments on this latest visit.
I liked the Johnny English who slept in a medieval suit of armour and had the rotor blades whizzing past his head.
I would like to see what Atkinson has to offer for physical comedy, but the humour seems to be a bit too fluid and superfluous, especially as serious film-makers such as James Bond and Mission Impossible include comedy as an ingredient.
Humour seemed to be aimed at children rather than adults and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as incongruous or farcical as the gags of Mr. Bean, the character played by Atkinson.
The recurrent British argument is that Britain is in serious difficulties.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the super-secret British web-spying network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing consternation among the agent in charge, Kevin Eldon.
It is the latest in a long line of prime ministers who are pretentious and self-aggrandising, who have already suffered a total collapse in political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best performance of her career, but the script does not go far enough.
Their intelligence advisers inform them that, as long as each spy is in danger, they will not be able to recover any of their pensions.
I include the bungling Johnny English, who is employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but who also gives extra-curricular classes on how to be a secret agent, with some good gags, and who runs an academy of espionage that looks like a rock school.
Catalan: 
Ara Bough is a home boy, a submariner enthusiast, and Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted on him.
Thus, Batman and Robin, the Dark Knight and his sidekick, find themselves in the middle of the secret service of the King, where they meet Olga Kurylenko's "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is still under the spell of the billionaire technological charlatan who claims that he can solve the IT problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculousness by dressing up as French waiters, setting fire to a French restaurant and causing chaos on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English provokes a great deal of confusion by trying to use a virtual reality device to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta &apos; s house.
All the parades have certainly come to an end with this last sequence, but with all its simplicity and naivety, it looks like a children's programme.
Quite normal things.
With the other Johnny English films, it has not been easy to think that the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it has ever proposed a four-day working week for British workers.
The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical plan according to which Britons will work four days a week and be paid for five.
Supposedly, the party that the CEOs of the companies are passing on to their workers with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) is giving them an extra day off.
Catalan employees enjoy a week of three days off, but they still work the same number of hours.
According to the sources, the idea would fit in with the economic agenda of the parties and their plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The change to a four-day week is supported by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) as a method by which workers can benefit economically from the change.
An experienced Labour Party insider told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a review of policy will be announced before the end of the year."
It will not be a 24-hour day, but a working week of four days is an aspiration that fits in with the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party had promised a four-day working week during the general elections in 2017.
Nevertheless, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration jointly at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: "A four-day working week is not a political issue and the Labour Party is not considering it."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell will use the party conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist economy.
McDonnell will show his determination to restore the power of the anonymous directors and the speculators in public enterprises.
The minister &apos; s plans also imply that shareholders in water companies could not recover all their investment, since the Labour government could apply &quot; deductions &quot; for criminal offences.
It has also confirmed plans to share out workers on the boards of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds for 10 per cent of the shares in the private sector companies, with annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change his opinion.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley will ask Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy showed more openness than his South Carolina colleague.
I speak seriously," said Kennedy.
At the sitting, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I asked him if he had made the accusations public, and he said he had.
It showed firmness, determination and resolve."
However, Graham &apos; s vote seems to be a dead weight.
I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I will present an explosive accusation," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett Kavanaugh is going to deny this categorically.
I cap de les persones que nomeni no ho podrà verificar.
Té 36 years.
I don't see any reason for that."
What is the Global Citizen Festival?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday, an annual music festival that brings together a star-studded line-up, and a mission just as star-studded: to eradicate poverty around the world.
The Global Citizen Festival will bring together thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the global goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which will begin in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to combat it.
For one free entry to the event (a VIP ticket), the assistants have to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
How long will it take Global Citizen to reach its goal of 12 years?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way of persuading them by asking them to make a call to action or simply to do something more than sign a petition or send a tweet.
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who have helped to achieve various objectives.
It declares that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and political pledges in excess of $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group will have achieved 390 commitments and follow-up actions, of which 10 billion USD have already been disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that the protected sources have had a direct impact on 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and implementers in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "help children grow as well as possible" and to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
Thanks to the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like yourselves, you can turn the injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history."
The group will also explain that after more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mares and foals, the Government will announce the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 500,000 children and foals with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F on their website which asked "what do you think will happen if they end up in extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen response: "It will be a long and hard road, but we will walk it together."
However, with the great movements of defence of civil rights and against apartheid in the past, we will triumph, because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at the event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blockade" to obstruct Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington pot, "if necessary," to go to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, according to US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed that Russia &apos; s intervention in Syria, primarily, is an invitation from the legitimate government, and is a pretext to explore our energy markets.
“I believe that the motive for moving to the East is the will to negotiate with energy, as is already happening in Eastern Europe,” he said, apparently.
According to the official, there are ways and means of dealing with this question.
The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that merchant shipping remains open and, if necessary, to block it, to prevent it from entering the market.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a self-described "consumer energy advocacy group" in the United States.
Compare Washington &apos; s strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and you will see that they are the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia was, more or less, to profit from and replace fossil fuels, he said, adding that Russia had only one recourse, since its economy was dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to push for the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in place of Russia, the most economically viable option for European consumers.
With this in mind, the officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States himself, Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is an "inadequate" project that will turn Berlin into a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington &apos; s fervent opposition to the project is due simply to economic reasons and is an example of good faith.
I believe that energy cannot be a weapon to pressure consumers, and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers, Minister of Energy of Russia Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industry organisation in Germany, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the USA to separate energy policy from the EU and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy policy," Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "think long and hard" about running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is expected to announce on Saturday that she will run for president after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
The Hill: "It's time for women to take over in Washington and fix the fracture in the White House."
After 6 November, I will take my candidacy for President seriously.
Warren will address President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and say that "he was leading the country in the wrong direction."
I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Thursday, Warren is going to say, "It is clear that an FBI investigation before the election is necessary."
A recent poll showed that a majority of Warren voters believed that they would not have to run in 2020.
Forty-eight per cent of likely Massachusetts voters said that Senator Kennedy would not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two per cent of Dutch voters supported the candidacy.
The poll will reveal a wider support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in favour and 48 per cent against.
Other Democratic names on the list include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden is going to tell the president officially, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cited Track Palin's involvement with TEPT at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin (26) will spend a year in Iraq after enlisting on 11 September 2007
They will be arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday
When my own son comes home, I want him to be able to understand other families who have been touched by TEPT and some of the emotional scars that come back with our soldiers, and I want to explain that to Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin will name the arrest &quot;the elephant in the room&quot; and say the following about his son and other veterans of war: &quot;Make it different, make it tough, make it a question of respect for your fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the armed forces, who have given to this country.&quot;
The suspect was arrested on Sunday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence assault and domestic violence with a weapon, according to Dan Bennett, chief of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the EU give support to a new asylum policy
States and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia will file an amicus curiae brief on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker challenging the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union will file in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
You will say that his wife and his children will be attacked, but the American officials will deny his request for asylum on 20 July.
I want to go to Texas.
Advocates for the States supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as generating a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as countries facing generalised problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine is expected to announce on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
Federal laws require that asylum requests be adjudicated according to the facts and circumstances of the request, and that this prohibition infringes on this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Advocates will also argue that the policy of denying immigrants entry into the United States is detrimental to the economy of the United States, since it is more likely that successful entrepreneurs and "job providers" will be denied entry.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions will order immigration judges to deny asylum to domestic violence and gang victims.
The asylum is available to those persons who leave their country because of persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
The asylum has not been able to solve all the problems, nor the most serious ones, but those which people face every day.
Desperate efforts to rescue survivors in Palu as the human toll mounts
For the survivors, the situation is becoming ever more desperate.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of two, said: &quot; The air is very heavy, &quot; as she relaxed with her feverish 11-year-old son at the evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance carries a corpse.
Water shortage."
Residents have been able to return to their destroyed homes to salvage what they can.
Hundreds of thousands of people are homeless, and the hospitals are full.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his leg, have been discharged from the military hospital in Palu, as the patients are being discharged because of the heavy shelling.
The llagrimas fell from her eyes as she explained how the violent terratrèmol would destroy the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where she and her daughter were staying.
There was no time to save ourselves.
He was trapped in the ruins of the house, he explained to Associated Press, and he added that his family had witnessed a wedding in the village.
I felt my wife crying and asking for help and then I did not feel her again.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope it will be soon."
The US ambassador accused China of "propaganda announcements."
One week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a North American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the North American newspaper to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump will address the China Daily supplement to the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, on Wednesday after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is meddling in US elections will mark a new phase in Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
It is normal for foreign governments to advertise their products, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has put pressure on the mutual trade.
The purpose of the Catalan aranzers is to punish the exporters of states, such as Iowa, that supported the Partit Republicà de Trump, according to experts from Catalonia and North America.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, said that Beijing had hurt workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
China, Branstad will write an opinion piece for The Des Moines Register in The Sunday: "They are redoubling their efforts to advertise propaganda in our free newspaper."
By publicizing its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the respected American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to insert an advertisement for payment in The Des Moines Register.
In China, where there are many people from Catalonia, I will find few differences and I will not be able to see a real reflection of the opinions of the Chinese people on the economic trajectory of China, until the Communist Party is no longer dominant.
You will recall that one of the most important newspapers in Catalonia refused to publish the article, but did not name the newspaper.
The Republicans are the voters of women before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, the analysts warn
Many of the leading Republicans have given their support and defence of Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing various sexual assault allegations, analysts have noted that they see a negative response, particularly among women, to the mid-term elections.
The emotions aroused by this case are extremely high and the majority of Republicans have already made it clear that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, told The Hill.
Reeher is going to say that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to wrap up the FBI investigation is not sufficient to calm the angry voters.
Karine Jean-Pierre, principal adviser and national policy director for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington Post on Friday that "people are not going to forget what happened today, or tomorrow, or in November."
On Friday, the Protestants cry "November is coming!" (November is coming) while demonstrating in the Senate vestibule while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decide to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be left out of the picture, explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
The people who have been here for a long time; that is certain.
However, I could have done more, especially among women voters and younger voters, aged between 18 and 29, who do not vote because they do not like the president."
Prior to Mr. Ford &apos; s public testimony, the complainants detailed their sexual assault allegations against the candidate for the Supreme Court. Analysts suggested that a negative response was possible if the Republicans pressed for confirmation.
That has become a blood clot for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said last week, according to NBC News.
It is not just about the vote of the board or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench. It is also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
The Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford testimony and those who believe in the Kavanaugh testimony, with the balance tilting towards the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 per cent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably lied, while 30 per cent said they believed Ford.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleges that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to store their data and share it with other users.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that the hidden agenda of Inrupt was "to rule the world."
I have to say that I am very pleased with the emerging company.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform to allow users to create their own "personal data locker" or POD.
May contain contact lists, pending tasks lists, a calendar, a music library and other personnel and professionals.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser now.
The one who is excluded from the personal data line is the user, who decides who can access the information.
The company calls itself 'empowerment through data'.
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s delegate, John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some in-house developers contracted to work on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
From this week onwards, developers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the available web services at Inrupt.
Berners-Lee is going to say that none of his people are talking to Facebook and Google about a radical change to all business models being built in one night.

In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the “mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new integrated web platform Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The last two months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
During the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web, Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Creu Victòria de la I GM
The only cleric of the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War was honoured by his home town 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the Croix de Guerre on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Nevertheless, it will be shot down four days later and he will never know that the most important British military honour has been lost.
They unveiled a commemorative plaque in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said that it was "magnificently symbolic" that the chalice was presented exactly 100 years after the trial.
According to The London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann was to lead his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin &quot; through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannon and machine-guns &quot;.
Later on the line of fire will be advanced with "maximum courage" and a single shot will be fired, leaving three members of the detachment unconscious.
The colonel was shot by a German rifle on 4 October 1918, just one month after the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) is going to say that his son's actions were a proposal that could never be equalled, which would produce a feeling of humility.
And their father, Dr. James Vann, will also lay a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann will say that he felt honoured to be part of the parade and will add that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he receives from many people.
The MMA fans who are going to stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 will be able to watch Peppa Pig on location
Imagine waking up all night to watch Bellator 206 and missing the most important event.
The San José banner contained 13 lights, six of which were main lights and the other seven spotlights.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing for their fight, the audience in the United Kingdom will be left stunned when Peppa Pig takes over.
Some people were disgusted at having to stay up all night to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the animated drawings as "a mouthful of vomit".
Dave Schwartz, vice-president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said: "The legislation of the Catalan government is not adequate, so they are going to change the children's programming."
Peppa the Pig, yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, is going to say that British viewers will be included in the programming in the future.
I believe that when I think about it, it can work," says Coker.
However, we can only do so much in a day, and we can only do so much on a Sunday.
But we are working.
When I changed channels, there were many messages coming in and going out, and not all of them were pleasant.
We intended to resolve it, but we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not like that. It was a government problem.
I promise you that it will not happen again.
I will leave you in the dark for five minutes, instead of six. I will try to get you back on track, but it will not work.
That is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he has felt inferior to the rest of the world because of his sexuality, but that it will provide him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said that he did not want to go to secondary school because he did not want to go to school with everyone else.
The Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, was about the rights of gay people to give hope to others.
I am also going to say that the Olympic Games have regained their importance.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, has been on sick leave for several months.
Daley, who will appear on the first episode of Laverne & Shirley, will say that he felt "less than" the others because "it was not socially acceptable for boys and girls."
Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, which have been real, have given me the power and strength to triumph.
She wanted to prove that she was "something", she said, so that she would not have to admit her sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile advocate for the LGBT movement and has used his image at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he had spoken because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and to give hope to others.
The tricampeon of the world is going to explain that he fell in love with a man, the American director Dustin Lance Black, who is going to marry him in 2013.
Last year, Daley was going to marry the Oscar-winning actress, 20 years his senior, but the difference in age has never been a problem.
According to him, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced the same highs and lows.
Robert Ray Black-Daley &apos; s name will appear on the ballot as Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Black-Daley, &quot; my whole perspective has been canvassed &quot;.
If I had asked him last year, all he would have needed was a gold medal.
There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is just like his father, Robert, who is going to die in 2011, at the age of 40, of a brain tumour.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he was going to ask for was whether he had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be at the front.
He could not say, "Stop, you will not be able to occupy the first row," he said.
While he was holding him by the throat, he would stop breathing and he would not be alive any longer, because I had finally accepted that he was not invincible.
The following year, Daley will compete in the 2012 Olympic Games and win bronze.
She knew that this was what she had done all her life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in the Olympic Games. There was no better feeling.
It will also inspire her first single (Proud by Heather Small), which accompanied her during the preparations for the Olympic Games, and which she is currently working on.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson to make Ryder Cup debut on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his physical state if he is to turn his luck around.
Mickelson, who will be playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, will be introduced by Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as is usually the case in the United States, the referee of the five major tournaments divides his time between being an animator and working on the pitch, with the hope of rectifying what is wrong.
The 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult course at Le Golf National, where the rough punishes wayward shots.
If Mickelson's own trajectory isn't particularly encouraging, he will face the precise challenge of the British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood for the next four rounds.
If the Americans start strongly, Mickelson's match could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk will express confidence in this home, without being able to say much more.
He will hear you perfectly on that day, he will give you a pat on the back and he will shake your hand while telling you that he is ready for it.
I have great confidence in myself.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
Probably, you did not imagine playing two matches.
I can imagine more, but I can also imagine less and less and less.
It would be like any other."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that has not equalled his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18, lost 20 and drawn 7, and Furyk has said that Mickelson's presence has brought intangible benefits to the team.
"He is funny, sarcastic, a joker, he likes to make fun of people and he is a great companion for the team," he explained.
I believe that the younger players are also enjoying this week, which has been a lot of fun to watch.
It brings much more to the table than just the game.
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage in the individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Danes will start the year 1997 at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they won by the narrowest of margins, 14.5-13.5.
“And we continue to have a great advantage at Valderrama; we have a great advantage at Brookline; we have a great advantage at Valderrama, and we will lose, but we will win at Valderrama, but we will lose at Brookline, but for a little while,” Bjorn said, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team, 5-3, on Friday and 10-6 on Saturday at Le Golf National.
History has taught me and all the members of the team that it is not yet over.
Tomorrow we have to go all out.
It has to come out and be seen.
That is not over until the fat lady sings.
We have a goal, to win the trophy, and we have to keep our concentration.
Yes, I have said it, in the 12 players we have in the squad, but also in our rivals, the best players in the world.
Pleased with the performance of his players at a demanding golf course, Bjorn said: "I won't rush into it."
Tomorrow will be different.
Individual income tax will make the difference tomorrow.
It is fantastic to be able to play golf with a friend, but it is the individual matches that really test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you must pass on to the players, the best you can do tomorrow.
At this moment, leave your company and it will leave you and it will also take the best of you.
In opposition to Bjorn, the captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to play better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will add three points.
Furyk knows all too well about the currency of the last day, as he will be part of the winning team at Brookline before losing to Europe in the "Miracle at Medinah."
I remember all the words, he replied to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, and his players had reacted the previous day.
Tomorrow we have 12 important parties, but we want to start with a few, like Brookline and Medinah.
When a team is inspired, there is a lot of pressure on these central duels.
I have prepared the line-up according to the circumstances and the best way to do so.
Thomas attempted to start a rematch against Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the European contingent.
He trialled that order because he wanted to cover all the possibilities, Bjorn said of his selection for the individual events.
The new German warship, delayed again
The new German frigate would have been completed in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, but it would not be able to do so until the end of the year at the earliest, according to local sources.
Completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main vessel of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first quarter of 2019, according to Die Zeit, which cites a military source.
The vessel would have been able to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that have arisen since the construction of the vessel have cast a shadow over this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates that the Navy will take over in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that it will include an anti-aircraft missile, a cluster of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-clandestine technology, including a radar reduced, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other distinctive features include longer maintenance periods: it would be possible to use the new ships for another two years without passing through national ports.
These continuous delays imply that the advanced vessels, which are expected to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will be obsolete by the time they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 will be a thing of the past next year, when the German Navy will return the vessel to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy had returned a vessel to the shipyard one year late.
They have few details of the movements of the vessel, but the German communications have cited various "material and technical defects" in the vessel which would render it unfit for use in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, since approximately 120 seamen, most of the crew required for the old Bremen-class frigates or the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, are working on vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class.
In addition, it has been pointed out that the weight of the vessel is excessive, which means that the revenue and the capacity of the Navy are limited.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as much as the merchant vessels used by the Germans during the Second World War.
The cost of the defective materials, which included the training of the crew, was also beginning to look like a problem.
It is believed that some EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) has been raised from a starting point of EUR 2.2 billion (USD 2.6 billion).
The problems of the new frigates have become an issue of special importance, taking into account recent warnings that indicate that the maritime military power of Germany is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the German Navy was "without ships that can be used".
The official has stated that the situation has worsened because the vessels will no longer be able to use them, but they will not be replaced.
He regretted that the Baden-Württemberg frigates were not able to join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of the rats
A new investigation has been carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland to find out how rats are using the landscape to feed themselves.
It is hoped that the findings will provide new data on the behaviour of these flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The research of the Scottish Natural Heritage Foundation will continue to be carried out in the north-east of Scotland, in addition to the research carried out in the north-west.
Special recorders will be stationed at key locations to monitor the activities of the rats during the season.
Volunteers and staff of the National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The analysis of the sound recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the rats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created in order to create a detailed image of the landscape of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, natural heritage assessor for the National Trust for Scotland, hopes that the results will show that the three habitat types are more important for roe deer and grouse than for other species.
This information will help to determine the advantages of habitat management, such as the creation of habitats, and to improve the maintenance of woodlands for roe deer and other associated species.
The ratpenat population in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Construction and restoration of buildings threaten the rats, as they affect the people and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do the paper matamosques and chemical treatments used in building materials, as do domestic cat attacks.
In fact, they are not cecs.
Tanmateix, because of its nocturnal hunting habits, the ears are more useful than the legs when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated location technique to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, is under serious threat.
We need experts with adequate training, who carry out surveys, inspections and rescues on a regular basis.
Altogether, the organisation has created the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to the red kite, at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the stronghold of the two species of red kite in Scotland.
The farm manager, David Thompson, said that it was the ideal habitat for the species.
Here, at Threave, we have a great area for red squirrels.
We have old buildings, many old trees and a good environment.
However, we still have a long way to go in terms of understanding the needs of the people who live here and in other properties.
He underlined the importance of proving whether there had been any previous maintenance work on the property, since it was possible that the accidental destruction of a colony of more than 400 females and juveniles could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
Els ratpenats are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, molest or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, of the Scottish Seabird Centre, has encouraged people to make a difference by helping.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about rats and, in the case of some of our species, we have no data on their population."
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the allegations of rape against him are "fake news" and has said that people "want to get famous" by accusing him.
Their lawyers will sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The captain of Portugal and Juventus, Cristiano Ronaldo, has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Presumptively, you will pay $375,000 because the incident is not public, as reported by Der Spiegel on Thursday.
In an Instagram Live video addressed to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, is expected to say that the allegations are "false news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What you have said today, false news, is the fifth time you have been awarded the Golden Camera.
I would like to thank my name.
That is normal.
I do not want my name to become famous, but it is part of my work.
A happy home and everything is in order,” the player said, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the complaint against Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible information on private life", in agreement with Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years."
The pre-trial hearing is scheduled for June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where it is alleged that Ronaldo raped Mayorga anally.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo is a "99% good guy", except for a "1%".
The documents allege that Ronaldo will confirm that the two will have sexual relations, but that they will be consensual.
Mayorga also asserts that she will go to the police and have photographs taken of her injuries at the hospital, but she will accept an out-of-court settlement because she &quot; feared reprisals &quot; and &quot; did not want to be humiliated in public &quot;.
The woman, aged 34, says she wants to annul the agreement because she is still traumatised by the incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of signing for Real Madrid from Manchester United in the aftermath of the incident and this summer he has signed for Juventus, the Italian giant, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK "will always lose car manufacturers"
The United Kingdom "will always come first", according to Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
He said it was "concerning" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that, if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory in Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, will produce 150,000 cars this year, of which 90 per cent will be exported to the rest of Europe.
Mr Cooke said: "My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal in March, production at our factory will be affected."
Leaving the EU without an agreement on trade with the rest of the EU has woken up other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that manufacturers will consider risks in the supply chain in the event of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with fish arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal on 29 March, it is possible that there will be disruption at the border, which the sector considers could cause delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain inventory for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to be shut down as a result.
Clark claims that Theresa May &apos; s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is &quot; calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls &quot;.
“We want to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement possible, not just enjoy the current situation,” he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The proof is not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, that they need to be able to continue with a joint chain of production."
Toyota could not confirm for how long the plant would be shut down, but it had warned that the costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, has said that the members are becoming increasingly concerned about the situation: "From experience, if they lose these jobs, they won't come back."
A government official has said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be reopened.
The expected meeting between US President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "postpone a week" while the fight over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court continued at the White House on Monday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller &apos; s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, the links between Russia and Donald Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump pardons or does not pardon the deputy attorney-general, he has fuelled rumours in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of recording Trump &apos; s conversations with him and also the possibility of testifying against Trump with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
However, last Monday he was due to go to the White House amid rumours that he was about to resign.
Tomorrow, you will announce a meeting with Trump, who was in the United States in New York.
Trump has said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but has put off the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with Kavanaugh and one of his accusers, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump will order the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which will further erode the Senate vote.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders will appear on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, the following reply was given: "We have not yet set a date, it could be this week, or it could be another week for all the applications to the Supreme Court."
But I can see it. I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists could refute this assertion: Sanders has not held a briefing at the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace is going to ask why.
Sanders is going to say that the lack of informative sessions was because he did not like the braggadocio of the television journalists, and he is going to say: "I am not going to deny that I am a braggart."
You are insinuating that there will be more direct contact between Trump and the press.
He will say, &quot; The President asks more questions and gets more answers than the previous President &apos; s, &quot; and will not quote the following: &quot; We have consulted these figures. &quot;
Sanders had said that the briefings would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me."
I have been trying to do so for the past few weeks, and I have been able to do so in the past few weeks and to replace the informative sessions with the opportunity to speak with the President of the United States.
Trump answers questions when he is at the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences.
Individual press releases are rare.
This week, in New York, the President has demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and in some moments, he has distanced himself from the press.
The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care wrote to workers in the National Health Service in Scotland
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the gratitude of the country and to wish them well after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, will be sending a letter in the next six months.
The Scottish Government has agreed to cover the cost of applications from EU citizens working in public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and it appears that they are heading towards the decisions that are expected at this late stage."
However, the Government of the United Kingdom has also begun preparations in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know that these are difficult times for all of you.
I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of all staff members, irrespective of their nationality.
EU companies, and those further afield, bring valuable experience and expertise to strengthen and improve the health service, while benefiting patients and communities.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a former Tennessee State Tiger, underwent emergency surgery on Saturday after suffering a leg injury in the team's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told the media that the injury will keep him out for about a month.
"He's going to come to the line and he's going to fall over," Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff will give Abercrombie oxygen before placing him on a stretcher and moving him to a litter in order to give him more time to recover.
A Tennessee State official informed Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris stated that "there is still no information on the type or amount of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury will occur.
This is Abercrombie's first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
There had been five red cards in the previous match, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the United Kingdom with the additional charges used to help people who are homeless according to our plans.
This will neutralise the Corbyn movement among young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect those persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Hisenda hopes to raise 120 million euros a year to help the homeless.
It is hoped that foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and that the proceeds will be used to help those who cannot afford to, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralise the exit of the Jeremy Corbyn movement among young voters by promising to provide more affordable housing than the Conservatives.
The increase in the stamp duty will be borne by those persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; the proceeds will be used to combat tax evasion.
The surcharge, which will be added to the stamp duty currently in force, including the higher rates introduced two years ago, could be as low as 3 per cent.
Hisenda expects to receive up to EUR 120 million annually.
It was estimated that 13 per cent of the new properties in London were owned by non-British residents, which increased prices and made it difficult for new buyers to enter the market.
Many areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
Last week, Boris Johnson announced a reduction in stamp duty for first-time buyers.
I will accuse the big builders of maintaining high property prices by buying land rapidly and not using it, and I will urge May to annul the affordable housing quotes to correct the 'housing crisis' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including controls on rent and the finalisation of “no-fault” evictions.
They also have the power to build new houses.
He may have said: 'Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring British sleep: life must get better for each new generation.
I would like to correct our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
Tanmateix, it is not correct that it should be easier for people who do not live in the United Kingdom to buy property in comparison with British residents who work hard.
For the mass of people, the dream of owning a home is still a distant one and the indignity of people without a home is still all too real.
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to coach Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "biggest ambition" was to one day manage Scotland.
The Scotsman, aged 42, has accepted the review of the club from the north-east, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points behind the leader.
You will arrive at the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
He said: &quot; I am going to call a snap election and this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going to be it, this is going
“However, I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden with my father, and that is something that always takes me back in time.”
This opportunity will only come to me if I have a club, however.”
Ross predecessors at Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The coach of Alloa Athletic says he does not feel under pressure to be the next name on a list of great names in a team as big as Barnsley or Ipswich Town.
At the moment, my criteria for measuring my success will be whether I can get this team back into the Premier League.
With the club's structure and facilities, it is obvious that its place is in the Premier League,” he said.
“It is not easy to get here, but I only consider it possible if I can return to the club.”
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, following a 15-month spell at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts.
It will help Alloa avoid relegation and transform St Mirren into Championship winners next season.
Ross says he is more comfortable in Catalonia than he was during his playing days at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This is probably going to be a decisive moment," he said.
I have always believed that training is better than playing.
I did it because I wanted to do it, and I did it properly and I enjoyed it.
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you have to overcome every week.
However, I feel good as a coach.

The perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has reduced the consumption of bars in Great Britain, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bars and pubs have seen an increase of 2.7 per cent in sales in July, but restaurant consumption has fallen by 4.8 per cent, according to the statistics.
Peter Martin, of the financial advisory CGA, the company that collected the data, said: "The continuing hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has been more than expected, have meant that July followed the pattern of June, with a 2.8 per cent rise in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have lagged behind.
The reduction of 1.8 per cent in restaurant consumption in June has had an impact on July.
Bars and taverns, led by the consumption of tapas, have obtained the best results, while restaurant consumption has fallen.
Bars that serve food have also suffered, just as restaurants have.
It seems that the people only wanted to get out.
In bars and taverns, sales have increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, while sales of food have decreased by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April."
The time and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors affecting the sales of the external market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a 4.8 per cent drop in sales from one year to the next would be particularly damaging, more so than the continuing pressure on costs.
This summer has been so long and so hot that it could not have arrived at a better time for the markets that serve food and time will tell whether the milder temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief that we need.”
The total increase in the sales of bars and restaurants, including the recent openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, indicating an increase in the number of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom collects and analyses data from 47 operators, with a combined turnover of over £9 million and is the benchmark for the sector.
One out of every five children has a secret account with a social network
One in every five children, some as young as 11, has a secret account in a social security scheme which is shared with parents and teachers, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has indicated an increase in fake Instagram pages
News has fuelled fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a "main" account that they show to peers
One out of every five children, some as young as 11, has a social security account.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has shown an increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has fuelled fears about the publication of sexual content.
20 per cent of students say they have a "main" account that they show their peers, while also having a "private" account.
A 13-year-old girl who went missing after sending a message to her friends asking them to "rape me" has been found.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Heads of Independent Schools Committee (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40 per cent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, of which 60 per cent have private accounts.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create online spaces with peers and teachers that parents cannot find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed as the executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation board at the annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's track and field athlete of the year and President Ian Beattie will describe the move as a great opportunity for those who lead sport to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
Mr Beattie said: "Eilidh has the respect of the Scottish athletics community, the United Kingdom and the rest of the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from Eilidh's appointment to the board."
Doyle said: "I have a lot of sympathy for the athletes and I hope I can help the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The United States, which will host the 2000 and 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, will be deprived of one of its four Olympic gold medals and one of its commentators for the BBC, who has suffered a transient ischaemic attack.

Catalan: 'Mares with cows divide opinion on the Internet'
A dairy company has divided opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares milk with cows.
To mark the launch of what it considers to be "the world's first silent electric breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a viral music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives women.
Four mares in a barn full of hay, with the rhythm of a song that goes like this: "Yes, my dear, but you won't see me again, because I haven't given you my heart."
The comeback: "Bombeja, bombeja, feed the fish, bombeja, bombeja, drown the fish."
Tanmateix, the announcement, published on the Facebook page of the company, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has broken a barometer of reactions from those who have seen it, with many saying that it shows the horrors of the dairy industry.
It is a bad decision to announce the product before it is ready.
For us, it is a matter of embarrassment and difficulty in producing milk, as we are separated from our calves for only a few days after they are born.
The Elvie breastpump is discreetly concealed in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented as follows: "Understandably traumatic for the sea and swimming.
But why not use them to announce a raffle for a horse that did not have any legs?”
Another user commented: &quot; This is out of place &quot;.
Other people defended the announcement; one woman admitted that the song was "fun".
I think it is a great idea.
I still have to give him a bottle.
Bombejar was like a cow in heat.
It is a lie, but we must take it as it is.
One user wrote: "It's a brilliant product."
Another person commented as follows: &quot; This is an advertisement aimed at people who are bored and want to have a laugh (normally at work or in the lavatory).
It is not the first time that the industry has been mentioned by a judge.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have danced with all the supporters discreetly.
The concept on which the campaign is based is based on the perception that many people feel uncomfortable when they use the toilet.
Tanmateix, the tirallet Elvie is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a lactation support, which gives women more freedom to move around, subject their breasts and, finally, leave the house.
Ana Balarin, co-founder and developer of Mother, said: “Elvie is a product so revolutionary that it deserves an audacious and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallel between giving and taking, we would like to show the public how useful a tirallet and a rope are, and how they can be used to demonstrate, in an entertaining and instructive way, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new tirallet.
This is not the first time Elvie has made the news.
During London Fashion Week, a pair of two-year-old twins walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied children, silently transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied children has increased since the monthly entries through the border have remained stable, in part because of the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, which have made it more difficult to care for children.
Traditionally, most godparents are immigrants without papers, who have taken the risk of staying in the country if they decide to have a child.
The risk has increased in June, when the federal authorities are going to announce that the possible sponsors and the rest of the adults who are going to adopt the children will have to send digital certificates, which they will share with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), will testify before Congress that ICE has arrested dozens of people who have sought to bring unaccompanied minors into the country.
The agency will confirm later that 70 per cent of the arrests had no criminal records.
“Up to 80 per cent of the people who have come to live in this country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminals.
Therefore, they will continue to pursue these persons,” said Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new standards requiring some children to appear in court within a month of being reported, instead of 60 days, as was the standard previously.
Many will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their case and obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be deported immediately.
More time in care, more likely to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to run away, according to workers and reports in recent months.
Advocates assert that these concerns can be intensified in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of its size, it will pass through all the signs indicating that a child is present.
They say that taking children to the camps without preparing them emotionally or saying goodbye to their friends can cause them trauma that they are not yet able to cope with.
Syria calls on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem will call on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also served as vice-prime minister, had said that foreign forces were operating illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the "war of terror" in Syria was "nearly over," with more than 360,000 people killed since 2011 and millions displaced.
He has stated that Damascus will continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have purged all of Syrian territory of all terrorist groups and any foreign presence that is illegal.”
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the country.
On the issue of the refugees, Muallem said that the conditions were good for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for escaping "irrationally" and leaving the refugees to fend for themselves.
He had appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate such returns.
They are making an assumption that it will be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The diplomatic representatives of the United Nations have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a de-escalation zone in the former rebel bastion of Idlib has provided an opportunity to continue the political process.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Tanmateix, Muallem and others noted that the agreement had "clear terms" and expressed the hope that the military action would deal with the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, which was linked to Al-Qaeda, and that they would be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, sent by the United Nations, is waiting to convene the first meetings of a new committee of members of the Government and the opposition to begin drafting a new constitution after the war and preparing the way for elections.
Muallem will present the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, the task of which will be to review the articles of the current constitution.
Why Trump will win again
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, just as he did in 2016, and, as many liberal spectators probably hope, the Senate and the impeachment process would end prematurely with his presidency.
That would be, no doubt, 'the end of a presidency more dramatic than any in history'.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the peak audience has more than doubled from 1.05 million to 2.1 million on CNN and almost tripled from 1.05 million to 2.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show," on MSNBC, has led cable news in prime time for the past three years.
Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series "Designated Survivor," said, "The people have been left behind because they haven't been told."
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell had another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver will tell him to vote for Trump.
Why?
Mr. Scovell will say, &quot; Because he was drunk &quot;.
There is a point of entertainment in the chaos.
The difference between the programmes on television and the one in Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if the families of immigrants could gather and the state of the world economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
I would like to be able to say that I am a citizen of the information age, and that I am more informed than most people at this hour of the morning, when a group of experts are debating the use to which Bob Woodward has put the phrase "for private use" in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 jacket, "a piece of garbage" (according to the Washington Post), and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' description of Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I will never again see Super Mario.
Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" on the changes in the show's cast and storylines, said, "Part of what makes 'Pawn Stars' feel like it's part of a reality show is that every night there's something new."
No and pots allow you to lose an episode because you have already seen it.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and it was raining outside her house on the north shore of Kauai, but she is going to be disappointed watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
They could not be detached, not with Brett Kavanaugh facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember when I first saw those programmes and the people who were watching them thought that this was the end of Western civilisation.”
I thought it was a joke, but it seems to be true.

External dinners drown out the elections to the Chamber of Representatives for the second half of the legislature
It is no surprise that there has been a flood of dinners in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has forced two current members to compete for the same seat.
This recent reassignment of the suburban Pittsburgh district involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who will be moving to another district after special elections last spring.
Lamb faced off against another current representative, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th District.
The maps are to be redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the district lines were drawn unconstitutionally in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial organisations of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb is going to make a name for himself in Pennsylvania after winning a special election in March to represent the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The Republicans have occupied the district for more than a decade and President Donald Trump is going to give it 20 points of difference.
Political experts give the democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposed sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, but then withdrew them.
Diplomats will note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump will maintain a tense meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners left the management of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the Department of State will decide to withdraw the caps on the diplomatic missions of the United States to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "in light of recent decisions regarding Taiwan," Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the Department, will declare this month.
Tanmateix, only sees the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which will receive $140 million in aid from the United States next year, according to estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and better economic conditions.
The proposed sanctions, which would include financial aid and restrictions on visas, would be harmful to the country and would increase the number of deaths by murder and assassination.
With the postponement of the internal meetings, the heads of government of all the countries concerned are postponing a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity in order to continue along similar lines to the one held last year and which will be seen as a step forward in preventing emigration to the United States.
However, by the end of September, high-ranking officials in the administration will clarify that they want the meeting to take place, and that it will take place in such a way as to be effectively sanctioned by El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been selected to chair the meeting, scheduled for October, as a signal of the importance the administration attaches to it, according to the diplomats.
The three United States envoys will leave quietly as their Salvadoran, Panamanian and Dominican Republic missions without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A Bolton White House official is expected to rebuff the details of the debate, which will include two diplomats, who will agree to discuss internal deliberations anonymously.
An external analyst will corroborate the statements.
History
The proper investigation could be the special counsel Robert Mueller &apos; s report on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, for which there are numerous public records.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump's campaign is colluding with Russia in its attack on the elections.
If Congress fails to act, Trump could be held to account by the agency, just as he is preparing to do before the voters, and, finally, before a jury of his peers.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be taken by all sides in the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted and if the Czechs and Slovaks had given their support.
You will lose the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that will follow.
The course of history fluctuates like a pendulum between extremes and accelerates or decelerates inexorably towards democracy.
The United States is currently confronted with various points of inflexion.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under water since the day before yesterday, when this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the President and speculating that it was not appropriate.
Rosenstein says the Times story is inaccurate.
“If the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it confirms the credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, I will vote no.”
I, in particular, will vote for a Congress that will make Trump responsible.
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to run the risk.
But I think they will not break, because I have already learned the language in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that will occupy the ambassador &apos; s house.
You will survive, you will emigrate to the United States and, 60 years later, you will send a torch to the table with the cross on it.
With all this, how can I be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans, Rangers, optimistic ahead of match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers beat Rapid Vienna today, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive draw against Villarreal last month, would put them in a good position to qualify for the Champions League group stage.
A knock to the knee will prevent Graham Dorrans from playing the first 20 minutes of the season, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better results.
“It will be a positive thing for us, because Vila-real is a good team,” he said.
"I think we can get a good result and come out with a point."
Perhaps we could come up with something more at the end, but probably a draw would be a fair result.
They will be better in the first half, but better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it is another major European event.
We hope to be able to stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult game because we need to get a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we will get a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but this is a good place to be.
The equipment is good and the training is good.
I hope that they will be able to donate all of it, as they did last season.
People lose their hearing as they get older
All participants in the survey have a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few people talk about it with their family.
Approximately half of the respondents in the national surveys say that they have talked to their partner about long-term care.
Only 10 per cent of the respondents said that they had not spoken to their children.
People don't want to talk about it, says Holly Snyder, vice-president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
Let us start here.
Speak with your partner and your children: you cannot prepare your family for you because you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and your family to decide what you want to do, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Please bring your financial adviser to the meeting: we can also discuss how to pay for these expenses.
Your options for financing your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash value that will help you cover your expenses, or your own resources, if you have the means to do so.
Prepare your legal documents:
Seeking a representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and to ensure that your wishes are carried out in the event that you are unable to communicate.
It also considers the possibility of contracting a notary for its finances.
To appoint a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf in the event of incapacity.
Don't worry about the small details: Imagine that your family member has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
These details are specified in a written statement to be prepared.
The finances are not the only factor to be taken into account, but also the fact that nine doctors are involved," Martin will say.
What are the medicines?
Who will look after the goose?

Tsunamis in Indonesia
Almenys 384 people have died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that will hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Thursday, according to the authorities.
With communications down, the units were unable to obtain information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu closer to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated following the disaster.
Some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Celebes, located at the extreme western end of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 persons in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency is located more than 300 km north-west of the island of Celebes.
The regency, a lower-level administrative unit, had a population of approximately 299,200 persons in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important to the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have experienced various tsunamis in the past 100 years, in accordance with the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The year 1996 will also produce a tsunami to the west of Donggala, killing more people.
Indonesia finds itself at the centre of the Pacific Rim and is able to produce terratrèmols at a certain frequency.
The major earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years are listed below:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake off the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, most of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes will affect the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Millions of people die on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, Indonesia &apos; s most populous island, causing a tsunami that killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people will die.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake in the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra caused a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed over 300 people.
2016: A strong earthquake will affect the regency of Pidie Jaya to Aceh and cause destruction and panic, as the population will remember the devastation of the earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
This year, there will be no tsunami, but more than 100 people will die because of the buildings that will collapse.
2018: There will be a series of large landslides on the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
It will destroy thousands of buildings and leave thousands of tourists stranded temporarily.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, will be arrested on charges of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Troopers report released Saturday.
In agreement with the police report, when a known person tries to trick the police by reporting a crime, the telephone is disconnected.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Detention Center on a $500 bond, KTUU reports.
You will appear in court on Saturday, when you will be declared 'not guilty, with security' when you are asked how you were declaring yourself.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, which means that she could go to jail for up to a year and pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B felony, punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her daughter, Sarah Palin, will go to the police to report the attack.
The case is currently before the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In 2016, he will be charged with domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while under the influence of alcohol.
His wife is going to say that he hit him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin will be criticised by veterans groups for associating her son's violent behaviour with post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Terratremol and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
Almenys 384 people have died after a landslide on the Indonesian island of Celebes on Thursday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake has caused a tsunami and has cost millions of dollars.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase over the coming days.
The tremor was felt only along the coast of Central Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social networks circulate videos at the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach at the city of Palu to welcome the tsunami.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional penalty for a suspect in the New York terrorist attack
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary punishment that has not been applied to the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is expected to use a Home Depot truck to carry out an attack in a bike lane on the West Side Highway, Lower Manhattan and cyclists, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must show that Saipov intends to kill the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" will cause grievous bodily harm, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Murder could be punished by death, according to the court document.
After the attack, a federal grand jury will indict Saipov with a 22-count indictment that includes eight counts of murder in the commission of a terrorist act, which federal prosecutors can use in cases of organized crime, in addition to a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors said that the attack would require "considerable planning and premeditation" and described how Saipov acted "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain, suffering and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last execution in the South District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Ambdós Rosenbergs died of electric shock on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, will not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police are going to explain that they are going to say to the investigators that they felt bad about it.
In accordance with the indictment, Saipov will explain to the authorities that he intended to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, they will also ask for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his room at the hospital.
He was found not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, is expected to say that they were "obviously disappointed" by the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton will say.
Saipov &apos; s defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be kicked out of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage is promising "to mobilise the people" today during a protest at the Conservative party conference.
The former leader of UKIP has said that politicians must "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he would like to lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone will tell the people of Birmingham that the UK would already be out of the EU if Nigel Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenge facing Mrs May as she seeks to reconcile deeply divided ranks has been underlined by the fact that the Conservative Brexiteers have made another protest against Brexit in the City.
The Prime Minister is fighting to hold on to her Chequers compromise between the attacks of the Brexit Party, the Remain Party and the EU.
The allies insist that they will succeed in reaching an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure from euro-sceptics and the conservative party to discuss their package and the chaos.
Mr Bone will tell the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wants to tear up Chequers.
I would suggest that Mr Farage has been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he has been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If I had been there, I would not be here.
The Member for Wellingborough will say: "I will defend Brexit, but we must deliver the Chequers compromise."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We do not want to fight world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws for our own country."
Mr Bone will dismiss suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British public has changed its mind and wants to leave is completely false."
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns is also going to be there, and she is going to stand up and say: "Only you, Prime Minister, can save us."
The Chequers compromise is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular within our party and among our activists, who are the people who support us and ensure that we win elections.
Abandoned the Chequers compromise and began to follow."
In a letter to Mrs May, he will say: "The Prime Ministers keep their word when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage will say that the politicians of the meeting must feel the pressure if they want to bring the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
This is a question of trust between us (the people) and our political class.
They are taking advantage of Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not let them.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he will say: "I want the political class to feel the pressure."
We are mobilising the popular tropes of this country which will give us victory over Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud Kingdom.
In the meantime, the pro-independence parties in Catalonia will hold a rally in Birmingham before the two-hour meeting.
A small number of activists waved banners against the conservatives after the launch of the group last week.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords, Lord Adonis, is to chair the Conservative Party's security review, which will look at the party's security problems in the light of the conference principle.
These are the people who tell us that they can provide us with the IT systems and all the technology that we need for a Canada-plus-more, a frictionless border, free trade without borders with Ireland."
It is a complete farce.
There is no option for a Brexit &quot; bo &quot;."
Warren has indicated that she would consider running for the presidency
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat will speak about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who will be Trump's running mate in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been the centre of speculation about the possibility of removing Trump in 2020.
The late Saturday session in Holyoke will be her 36th meeting with constituents in an open format that President-elect Trump will assume.
An assistant asked whether she intended to stand for the presidency.
Warren will respond that it is high time that "the vaginas in Washington repair our government that does not work, and that includes one in the Cabinet."
One person arrested for the murder of Sims, LSU
The Baton Rouge, La., police will announce Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Thursday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at the press conference at 11:00.
To publish a video of the shooting on Friday and to ask for help in identifying the shooter.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed on the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
Wayde Sims is going to get another shot at him, finally, and he's going to kill him."
Wayde is going to try to defend his friend and he is going to try to do a Simpson.
Simpson will be questioned and will admit that he was at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson will be arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior at 2m, played 32 games with 10 tackles last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 tackles and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton secures the title of the world champion after passing Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas will be ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it will be clear that the orders from the Mercedes team will have a major impact on the race.
From pole position, Bottas held a good start and almost caught Hamilton while defending his position on the first two corners and inviting Vettel to attack him.
Sebastian Vettel is going to come into the pits before Lewis Hamilton and he is going to let him pass on the back straight, which will have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes will have to stop in the pits and come out behind Sebastian Vettel, but Lewis Hamilton will overtake Vettel after a wheel-to-wheel move that will put Vettel at risk of losing the inside line after a double move.
Max Verstappen will start from the last row of the grid and finish the race in first place on his 21st birthday.
Next, he will continue in a good position for the rest of the race, as he will keep his tyres in good condition, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and move up to fourth.
Finally, he will enter the pits on lap 44, but he will not be able to increase his pace for the next eight laps and Raikkonen will be in fourth place.
It is a difficult day, because Valtteri has done a fantastic job throughout the week and will be a real gentleman who will be told that he has done well.
The team has done a fantastic job to keep a one-two" Hamilton said.
His body language will be terrible
US President Donald Trump has accused Senator Dianne Feinstein of leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in Virginia, the President did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee showed that people were "sad, cruel and mendacious."
One thing that could pass through the Senate in the last few days, when it is angry, when it is hurt, when it is cruel and when it is lying, is that.
When you look at the communications and the filtering and you say "No, I was not there."
No, I have not.
Recorded?
Dianne Feinstein, how do you filter?
He had noted her response. "Eh, what?"
No, no.
I could not filter it."
Yes, wait a minute.
Vam filtrar... No, no vam filtrar.", he said while imitating the senator.
Feinstein is going to re-release the letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh in July, but she is going to deny that the leak came from her office.
"I did not vet Dr. Ford's statement, I did not vet her history," Feinstein will explain to the committee, according to The Hill.
I asked for it to be confidential and I have kept it confidential.
However, his denial will not please the President, who will say at the Saturday meeting: "You know what? Your body language will be terrible."
Perhaps I won &apos; t do it, but it &apos; s the best physical language I &apos; ve seen."
Continuing with his defence of the candidate for the Tribunal Supremo, accused of sexual misconduct with three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using his own words against him.
They are determined to regain the power they need.
He said, &quot; I don't care about cruelty, I don't care about injustice, I don't care who does it, as long as they do it for power and control, &quot; according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars to repair the Friday night defeat to Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants had a two-goal lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their equipment, but Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee after two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen ensured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for the Elite League men's team of Adam Keefe, who has just joined Dundee from Belfast.
It will be the fourth match between the two teams and the Giants have won the first three.
The first goal came from the head of Dwyer at the 3:35 mark, assisted by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with the help of David Rutherford, Beauvillier doubled his advantage.
During this initial period, Sullivan will re-establish the home team at the 13:10 mark before Matt Marquardt assists on the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer will ensure the Giants' advantage in the first break when he scores the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team is going to regroup and Bouchard is going to contribute to that with a goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran will combine to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the second half of the game and ensure their victory with five goals at the end of the game.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are at home, at Milton Keynes, on Friday.
An air traffic controller saves hundreds of passengers from a plane crash
An Indonesian air traffic controller became a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with 100 passengers on board landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have been missing since a large earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Thursday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas have been produced in the area and many people have been caught in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave the shaky tower of control at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It will be your responsibility to ensure that Batik 6321, which was on the runway at the time, took off safely.
After that, he came out of the control tower of the airport when he thought he was sinking.
You will die later at the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, will say that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
Prepare a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost contact with the helicopter before it arrived in Palu.
That is what has happened.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll could reach 1,000, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the representative of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Agency, said, "We hope that the number of deaths will increase because there are still many people under the rubble and there are still many people who cannot be reached."
The ones, with a height of 6 metres, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are providing assistance.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, will tell Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries a corpse.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the kittens have been stolen."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, will explain to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find."
This is a tragedy, but it is not over yet."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo will arrive in Palu on Sunday and will tell the armed forces: "We want you to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
Are you ready?", CNN asks.
Indonesia is likely to suffer another major earthquake this year on Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini crash in Micronesia: One person missing after Air Niugini crash
The airline that operated the flight that went missing over the Pacific to Micronesia had disappeared one passenger, and the 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated safely from the aircraft that had gone down.
Air Niugini will issue a press release on Saturday afternoon stating that there is no passenger.
Aerolínia will claim to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find it.
Aerolínia will not respond immediately to requests for additional details on past passengers, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats are assisting in the rescue of other passengers and the crew of the aircraft which crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities will inform the public on Friday that 11 people have been transferred to hospital.
Aerolínia said on Saturday that there were still six passengers in hospital and that they were all in good health.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
Both the Air Force and the US Navy are claiming that the aircraft will land short of the runway because the runway is too short.
Some witnesses thought that the aircraft was going to pass over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, the American passenger, will explain that the aircraft was flying very low.
That would be extremely positive, Jaynes said.
Jaynes is going to say that he and other passengers were able to walk with water up to their waists to the emergency exits on the plane, which was sinking.
You will say that the auxiliaries will be in a panic and that one of them will be wounded.
The US Navy is going to say that the sailors who were working on the boat to make it seaworthy are also going to help in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to take the people ashore before the plane sank.
Aviation Safety Network statistics show that 111 people have died in PNG air accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
One analyst compiled a chronology of the events leading up to the burning alive of a woman
The public prosecutor closed the case on Saturday in the revision of the trial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst from the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, will testify as an expert witness in the intelligence analysis unit.
It will describe the use of the mobile phone records to build the movements of the accused, Quinton Tellis, 29, and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19, the night she died.
Rowlett is expected to testify that the phones showed that Tellis was at Chambers the night Chambers died, which contradicts his earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
If the phone records show that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he is alleged to have been with Michael Sanford, the police will speak to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford will testify that he was not in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford &apos; s truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency will be that Tellis will claim that Chambers knew him for two weeks before he died.
The telephone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett will say that, some time after Chambers &apos; s death, Tellis will remove Chambers &apos; s messages, tricks and contact information from Chambers &apos; s phone.
Hale says, &quot; It will be taken out of their lives. &quot;
The defence was expected to begin its final arguments on Monday.
The judge is going to say that he hoped that the case would be heard on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A trio of hip-hop artists complete her music by challenging the negative view of gender.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins in political and social problems.
Bring back your roots and bring back conscious hip-hop.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently risen to prominence in the United Kingdom, such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Catalan: Mainadera of NY asked for a partner after a "racist" message
A New York City woman has filed a discrimination complaint against her sister after her sister sent her a text message complaining that she was "another black person."
The Catalans deny that they are racist and compare the demand with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, will be shocked to learn that the new Minister, Giselle Maurice, is black when she starts work on 1 January 2016.
NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON, she writes to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending him to his mother, he sends him twice a week to Mrs. Maurice.
After praising Mrs Plasco-Flaxman &apos; s &quot; charming manners &quot;, a &quot; very uncomfortable &quot; Mrs Plasco-Flaxman went on to say that the woman she had met, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had been expecting a Filipino, in agreement with the New York Post.
Mrs Maurice is going to pay for her taxi fare and then send it home with Uber.
Mauritius demands compensation from his wife for the loss of companionship and asks for approximately $350 per day for the loss of his home for the remainder of his six-month contract, which he had not signed.
I will show them that they cannot do things like that, I will tell the Post on Friday, "I know that is discrimination."
The Catalan side has responded to the allegations that they are racist by stating that they are the most reasonable, since they do not trust the Mauritian side after having been offended.
My wife is going to send you something you did not want.
It is not racist.
I am not a racist," Joel Plasco, the captain, told the Post.
But, would you leave your children in the hands of someone who has beaten you, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Vinga."
Plasco, who has compared the demand to "extortion", is now claiming that she will have to wait two months to have a baby and that she is in a "very difficult situation."
To pursue something like that?
That is not a very friendly attitude," the investor banker added.
The legal case has not yet been resolved and the public prosecutor has promptly denounced the social networks and condemned their behaviour and their logic.
The editors of Paddington bear witness that the readers do not identify with a bone that speaks, in agreement with a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who is going to publish the book in a few days, will say in relation to the letter: "It is difficult to stand in the place of someone else for the first time after the book has been published."
It is a great relief, of course, for those of us who know something about Paddington to know that it is going ahead."
He will explain that his father, who had worked for the BBC before writing the children's book about a little mouse, was optimistic about the book. He will also say that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books will be "agredolç", after his father's death last year.
I describe Paddington as a very important member of his family and that his father was very proud of him.
He was a quiet man, not a presumptuous one.
But Paddington was so real to him that it was almost as if your son had done something: you were proud of him, even if he hadn't.
I think he thought Paddington was a good idea.
All that was his creation and his imagination, he always recognised the worth of Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by telephone
On landing, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked to save her life.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse often said that it was very difficult and that she did not expect me to succeed.
Aleshores told Nad that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that he had to say goodbye.
I have done it.
I said to him, "Tashi, I respect you so much."
Aviat with you.
I will go with you.
The medicines that they had donated because they had continued to take them have been consumed and have left their system.
It had been dead for some time before it was extinguished.
All he had to do was wait, because he knew who was coming.
I could not cry or scream because I was in a situation surrounded by family and friends.
I have to keep in good shape."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, the mother of the missing girl, is going to board the plane with the rest of the passengers, accompanied by her experience.
No one knew anything about it.
He had the cap and the llagrimas no podían parar.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt sympathy for Nadia.
The feeling that I needed from my love and my understanding.
I know that the will is strong."
Targets to prevent suicides on bridges
Donations made by people who have committed suicide are being used to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been targeted in a bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers for citizens to call for assistance.
The daughter of Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, committed suicide.
I do not want to feel what I have to feel every day.
Mrs Davis, aged 45, of Lydney, Gloucestershire, is going to say that her son was a promising chief executive with a contagious smile.
Knowledge is power.
As long as his shadow could illuminate any room."
Tanmateix, you are going to abandon your work before you die because you are in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's father, who was 11 years old at the time, found out that he had his own life.
Mrs. Davis will say: "I am concerned that there is a collateral effect."
Mrs. Davis is going to create targets "so that people know that there are people they can go to, that they can talk to, even if it is about a friend.
No et quedis en silenci: you must speak."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been Mrs Davies &apos; friend for 15 years, will lose Mark, her partner, shortly after his death.
He is going to say that it was not good, that he was depressed and that he was not himself.
Two days before Christmas, there will be a change in attitude.
On the day of Christmas, when the children open their presents and do not look at the others.
You can say that her death was a great trauma for them, but they have to work: "Open a wound in the family."
It will be destroyed.
But we must continue to play."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs by a thread as the FBI begins an investigation
I thought that if we could give them something that they were asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time frame), we could achieve some degree of unity.
Why did Senator Kavanaugh and his Republican colleagues not want an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks are left for the elections of the members of the Catalan Parliament of 6 November. If, as is expected, the Republicans do not obtain good results, they will be weakened in their efforts to ensure that the person who wins the election is elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been phoning senators and pressuring them to vote for Brett Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for George W. Bush. He will also know his wife Ashley through George W. Bush, who was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, now there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The name of deserters from North Korea "cau" with Kim
The name of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has been on the rise since Kim Jong-un came to power, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said that 1,127 people had deserted last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park will say that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the fees charged by traffickers have been the main factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Normally, North Koreans who defect to South Korea are granted South Korean nationality.
The Seouls claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority escape through Xina, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Xina considers deserters to be illegal migrants, rather than refugees, and sometimes forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the outset, the leaders of the two countries will meet in Pyongyang to hold talks centred on the denuclearisation negotiations.
That will happen after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they will agree in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea &apos; s minister of external affairs, Ri Yong-ho, will blame the United States for the lack of progress.
Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first.
Nancy Pelosi said Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical figure" and is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi will say that Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and that his temperament renders him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi will make those comments in an interview with the Texas Tribune Festival on Saturday in Austin, Texas.
It is hard not to think that if one woman had acted in this way, she would have said that it was a "historic", as Nancy Pelosi said in relation to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday.
Kavanaugh, emotional, will deny the allegations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During Kavanaugh &apos; s initial statement, Kavanaugh was visibly emotional, crying and unable to speak while talking about his family and his years at Yale.
We will also condemn explicitly the Democrats on the committee and tell them that the charges against them were a "grotesque and coordinated assassination of a character" organized by the disgruntled liberals because Hillary Clinton was going to lose the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi will say that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, since it showed his bias against Democrats.
He said he believed that Clinton and the Democrats had "disqualified themselves" with those statements and the way they were attacking them.
Pelosi will show some reticence when asked whether she would try to block the confirmation of Kavanaugh, if he is confirmed, and whether the Democrats would advise the Senate to vote for him.
That is what I can say: if you did not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you are not qualified to be on the bench, but you are not qualified to be on the bench either.
Judge Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi is going to say that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he evaded questions about annulling certain decisions of the High Court.
This is not the moment for a person with a history of violence and prejudice to enter the Tribunal and expect us to be amazed.
The people must exercise their power.
It is a justifiable diatribe: months and years of abundant fury without tears.
As Mrs. Steinem said 45 years ago, &quot; We shall overcome some day. &quot;
No, I don't think so. And you?"
I will continue... "You will help a lot of women who were executives in some place where they would also cry when they were angry, but they would develop a tactic of saying to the person they were talking to: "Perhaps you think I am sad because I am crying."
I am angry."
I continued.
It looks bright."
The &quot; llàgrimes &quot; are permitted as an outlet for rage because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest records I have is of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once burst into tears with rage, and it was the boss of the department, a woman who had always terrified me.
We do not want to see them crying.
You don't know how furious I am.
Think you are sad and they will be happy, because they will have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital affair on a boat named Monkey Business and was forced to resign from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was very frustrated, thought that there was no reason to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
It will not be a well-considered decision," he said, 30 years later.
Yes, there were other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone will say "Blancaneu and the little ones"
With the campaign running late, he had to promise not to run if he did not recapture $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
You will find out that some of your party members, who are only willing to donate $1,000 to you, are only willing to donate $250 to you.
Do you think I have a discount?
As she was about to deliver her speech and announce that she would not be launching a formal campaign, she was so overcome with emotion (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of recapturing voters and orienting them, instead of addressing the delegates, and anger and sexism) that she would have nothing to say.
Mrs Schroeder recalled that the press had thought she was having a nervous breakdown.
It might have been thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put on my tomb?
"Will you cry?"
US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial salvoes of the trade war between the United States and China will be deafening and, unless the war appears to be coming to an end soon, the countries involved may end up losing out in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, will issue his first warning at the beginning of this year, when he imposes taxes on China's main exports, such as solar panels and aluminium.
The most significant escalation will take place this week, with tariffs on goods worth $200 billion. These tariffs would apply to all goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time in the same way and recently it has raised tariffs on 60 billion USD of American goods.
Xina has committed itself to replicating the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will follow suit in the near future.
Washington will have to make concessions on some issues, but to do so publicly in front of the United States would be mass suicide for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
All in all, the experts say that, if Beijing plays its cards right, the trade war with the United States could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the Center for New American Security, a panel of experts, said, "A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for a downward spiral in any of these countries."
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by a war that has lasted more than four years.
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem will say that the conditions in the country are improving.
At present, the situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas that the terrorists have destroyed in order to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country of origin, which have been abandoned because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures, must be met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million euros have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also millions of people who come to the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem will say that the Syrian regime is ready to accept any help in rebuilding the country.
However, he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries financing the insurgency.
The European Ryder Cup team advises victory in Paris
The European Ryder Cup team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The USA have now lost six successive Ryder Cups on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
The European team will be back in the hunt when Thomas Bjorn's Danish team arrives at 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who is going to play most of the tournament, will hit the ball into the water on the par-3 16th hole, handing the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari is going to shine in all his matches and is going to become one of the four players who have won 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth will be paired with the European Tour's least-qualified player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, is going to lose 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played in his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, is set to become the biggest winner in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
We cannot avoid it today, but we can avoid it tomorrow.
It has been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for listening to me and helping me.
I am so happy to have won the cup.
The equipment is the most important... I am happy to have been able to help," commented an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
Passing the baton to compatriot John Ram, he beat the legend of American Tiger Woods 2-1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
I am incredibly proud to have Tiger Woods on my team," said Rahm, 23.
Woods will lose the four matches he had against France and will have a record of 13-3-3 at the Ryder Cup.
A statistical tie for one of the greatest players who ever lived, with 14 major championships and only one behind Jack Nicklaus.
The North American team will play all week to try to win, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who will play high-level golf all week.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, is going to speak after the frustrating result of his team: "I am proud of these players, they have fought."
This morning we have had a moment of pressure on the European team.
We are fighting.
For Thomas on the third barret.
It is a great capacity.
Their 12 players have played very well.
By regrouping, working with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and moving forward.
I am proud of these 12 players and their captain.
There is no such thing as a free lunch.
They have been defeated."
