This discovery confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has long been widely accepted, but it offers details that fossils usually cannot offer, such as the color and three-dimensional arrangement of the feathers.
The birds plumage was brownish-gray on the top with a pale grayish-brown background.
The discovery of a fossilized bird's feather in the fossil record of the late Cretaceous Period of North America, which is now preserved in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History, is a new insight into the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Because the feathers of dinosaur didn't have a cannon-like barrel, but other characteristics of the feathers, like barbules and bàrbules, the researchers conclude that the raquis must have been a more recent evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for display or to regulate body temperature. The investigators have suggested that, although the tail of a dinosaur young, the show is the feather of an adult and not of a chicken.
The researchers suggest that, although the tail of a juvenile dinosaur looks like feathers, the feathers are not yet fully formed.

NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow for faster, more direct, and more efficient flights and save billions of gallons of fuel and carbon dioxide each year and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The technology used by the FAA is based on satellite-based technology rather than radar.
The underground station is not expected to be closed, but the rail services will be disrupted.
The concern of a lack of transport has led to the possibility that the game may be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A new species of bird has been discovered in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
The new species has evolved in only two generations, despite the belief that it would take a lot of time for the crossing of a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fuertes (endemic), and a Galapagos finch, Geospiza conirostris (foreign).
Silver is a common alloy of silver and gold.
It can be inserted into thin strands, which can be twisted.
It can be very fine and pile up on other metals. It can be so fine that it can be used to decorate images painted by hand in books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is the pH of a substance. You can make a pH indicator by using a sample of col lombarda juice.
The colour of the coleslaw juice changes according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H) in the substance being analyzed.
Ions of hydrogen are protons to which electrons have been removed (in the sense that hydrogen consists of a proton and an electron).
Mix the dusty powders and then, with your clean hands, make a ball.
The skin on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
The remains of sewer pipes have been found in houses in the cities of Creta and Santorini, in Greece.
The first public toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China were built.
When you call someone who is miles away from you, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the signal and then reflects it back to you almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. The scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view.
A huge rocket is needed to lift a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in a way that is incredible. The most notable thing that the wheel has done for us is to make transportation much faster and more convenient.
He brought the train, car, and other transportation.
Below them are smaller cats that eat smaller prey, from small rodents to antelope and even cérvols.
Finally, there are many small felids (including the domestic cat) that eat the small prey that is far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, birds, and even small mammals.
The secret of his success is the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat has and that prevents him from competing with the other cats.
Lions are the most social of all felids and live in large groups called bands.
The packs are made up of a dominant male and a harem of females and their offspring.
Female relatives usually live in close proximity, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions tend to behave like packs or wolves, which are animals with a similar behavior to that of the lion (although not as dangerous to their prey) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (even if not very well), swim, jump great distances and push with 5 times the strength of a human strongman.
The tiger is of the same group (cat genus) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is like the roar of the lion, but is louder and more like a phrase shouted in anger.
To ocelots, the animals that they like to eat are small animals. If they can, they will hunt mice, snakes, birds, and small birds.
The scientists believe that the ocelots follow and catch prey with their smell, scenting out (pursuing) prey with their sense of smell.
They can see very well at night with vision night vision, and they can move very quietly. They hunt their prey by ambushing them in the dark and then affording to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to afford to af
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main group and original population (for example, crossing a mountain or river, or emigrating to a new island and not being able to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment from that they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations that they had before.
With time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new surroundings, they begin to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
Species formation is the formation of new species.
Plants make oxygen that humans breathe and take the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (that is, expire).
Plants make their food by using the sun to make their food.
We build our houses with plants and we make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat is plants. Without plants, most animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, so it had no fear of anything, except other mosasaures.
His jaws were long and sharp like knives, and he had a second set of teeth in the sky, so that there was no escape for anything that was in his way.
We don't know it's certainly true, but it may have had a bifurcated tongue.
He attacked anyone who entered the water; even a T. rex couldn't match him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some unusual foods at their feasts; like wild boar, deer, lizards, and squirrels.
Another difference was that the poor ate in chairs, while the rich ate in the dining hall.
The ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that have come to Europe from America or Asia in centuries later.
So for example, they didn't have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, peas, or peanuts, and no ancient Roman ever ate a turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which they considered the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to cover the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard open to the public and a sanctuary closed to the public.
Sometimes, pyramids were built in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, as part of temples.
The tower's top was a special shrine for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing wasn't as important.
The Jewish family life was spent in the open air.
The women cooked in the kitchen; the shops were simple open counters that looked out onto the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was expensive.
Greenland was scarcely populated. The sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland because of a murder and, on his journey westward, he discovered Greenland and gave it the name.
Now, the discovery of the Inuit in the Arctic is a recent phenomenon.
Although all were Scandinavian countries, there were many differences in the customs, history, and culture of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the National Treasure movie, you may have imagined that behind the Declaration of Independence is a map of the treasure.
Now, the map is not a treasure map. It is a map of the city.
The Declaration of Independence was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although nobody knows with certainty who wrote it, it is known that the long scroll (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was folded to store it.
So, it seems that the notation was added just as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the Vichy France.
The allies invaded southern France on 15 August 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and French forces had liberated southern France and were advancing on Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and that also defines somewhat the dimensions of society.
Civilized states precede nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a fair and equitable sharing of knowledge.
The cultures that disappear without leaving any historical traces are often forgotten and are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the War of Independence, the Thirteen Colonies formed a weak central governmentbeing the Congress its only componentunder the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no executive or judicial power, it fell on the state officials to enforce its acts.
He was not authorized to invalidate any tax or tariff laws between states.
The articles needed the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended and the states often absentee themselves from the government central.
The national team of Italy, with the national team of Germany, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup 2006.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swimming, cycling, ice hockey, auto racing, and Formula One.
The most popular winter sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and there are many Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), which makes it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the islands that Japan has, we often call it an "archipelago".
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors named the island Beautiful Island.
The year 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, where they initiated a transformation of indigenous agricultural practices and relied on Chinese workers for the plantations of rice and sugar.
The year 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) takes control of the coastal areas of western and northwestern Taiwan, and declares Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
The year 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which Taiwan is ceded to Japan, which will govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how the buildings looked originally.
The year 1976, the restoration of Machu Picchu had reached thirty percent and continues today.
For example, the most common film format is 35mm, which was the primary film format in the era of analog film.
The ratio of the width to the height of the image is still the same, but the aspect ratio of the image has changed.
The 35 mm format creates, in fact, a little confusion, with 36 mm of width and 24 mm of height.
The aspect ratio of this format is, therefore, 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family) are very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been too often used and often ridiculed, is a simple rule that creates dynamism and at the same time maintains order in an image.
The most effective place for the subject is in the intersection between the lines that divide the image into three vertical and horizontal sections (see the example).
During this period the European history was put into question, the Catholic Church became rich and powerful.
Over a thousand years, Christianity united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
His power was omnipresent, affecting kings, peasants, and commoners alike.
The Christian principle is that the rich should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds exist to that end.
The authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money had caused many people to ask if it was being fulfilled.
The blockade of Germany began after the first shelling of the city.
The strategy was effective, cutting off the vital supplies of military and civilian personnel, but this blockade violated international law generally accepted that had been codified by several international agreements in the last two centuries.
The British mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering segments of ocean, even if they were neutral.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany was expected to respond with a submarine war without restrictions.
During the 1920s, the majority of citizens and nations were pacifist and isolationist.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to avoid a situation similar in the future.
The year 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company of New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with four cents in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of showing different periods of history: each era of the Chinese or of each family in power was a different dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods, there were many fierce wars between many of the nobles who fought for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was a period of bloody conflict in China, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the seat of power at the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects like the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
The occupation of the city was opened to all men who applied.
This applies to the military as well, because in place of classes, the military hierarchy is based on relevance.
The French Revolution inspired many other working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters that transcended this mundane life.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, gives a clear picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
The cave is difficult to find, even for experienced cavers.
There is no sign of anything but a clear and beautiful sky above our heads, and the mountains that surround us. There is very little of this world that can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that is still standing.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, built by the ancient Egyptians, is one of the Great Pyramids of the world.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (among which, the Great Pyramid is the largest), several tombs, and several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Kheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and temples in the necropolis were built in honor of the wives and family members of the Pharaoh.
The sign "V" (ve baixa) signifies "victòria" and the "V" signifies "victòria" and the "V" signifies "victòria" and the "V" signifies "victòria" and the "V" signifies "victòria" and the "V" signifies "victòria" and the "V" signifies "victòria" and the "V" signifies "victòria" and the "V" signifies "victòria" and the "V" signifies "victòria" and the "V" signifies "victòria" and the "V" signifies "victòria" and the

The frightened King Louis XVI, his two small children (Maria Teresa of 11 years and Louis-Charles of four) and the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were compelled by a mob of women traders to return to Versailles from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows completely.
In a certain point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles to the terrified Queen.
The war expenses of the American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial American government, in order to cover the interest and principal of the floated government bonds.
The great gains derived from the exploitation of the Filipinos would be the basic gains of imperialism in the United States.
To understand the Templers, you have to understand the context that spawned the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 10th to the 13th centuries (1.000 - 1.300 dC).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which lasted from the 11th to the 14th centuries.
Determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas, from the impetus of technology to a narrower sense of the imperative that human fate is guided by a hidden logic that is associated with science and its manifestation in technology.
The majority of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology in itself follows a course independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, cars are necessarily driven to the development of roads.
However, a network of roads for a few cars is not economically viable, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of having a car.
The possession of cars in large numbers also leads to a higher rate of car accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair bodies damaged by accidents.
Romanticism was a cultural movement that emphasized the importance of the individual, imagination, and the imaginative arts.
In the context of Romanticism, geography gave shape to people, and with time cultures and customs were better than laws imposed arbitrarily, as they were in harmony with the place and with the society.
As Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in the feudal Europe.
Their reputation for being a center of luxury began in the 400s and lasted until the 11th century.
His status waned during the twelfth century because the Crusaders had returned with gifts like silks and spices that had more value than those that the markets in Constantinople offered.
It was in this moment that the title of capital of fashion went from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 13th century.
The initial clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, and because of the slow communication channels, styles could often arrive with 25 to 30 years delay.
The end of the Middle Ages saw the development of a distinctive style in Western Europe. One of the major developments of the time is that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
 subsistence farming is the farming that is done for food only, and is not intended for commercial sale.
The subsistence farming system is a simple, organic, and often organic system that uses native seeds of the ecoregion combined with rotation of crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield.
Historically, most farmers in developing countries were subsistence farmers, and still is in many nations in development.
Subcultures gather individuals with similar ideas who feel abandoned by society and develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of the factors.
The members of a subculture often distinguish themselves from other subcultures by the use of symbolic styles, which include modes, customs and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to show the few cases of children who were not socialized by adults while they were growing up, due to neglect, misfortune or malicious intent.
These children are called "wild" or "feral". Some of these children have been isolated by people (generally their parents); in some cases this abandonment was due to the severe intellectual or physical disability of the child by the parents.
Children of the wild can have suffered abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Other people have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all alone.
The wild child, when raised only by animals, presents animals-like behaviors (always within the physical limits) almost identical to those of the animal that raises him, such as fear or indifference in relation to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning more fun and interesting, the bastida is a step further.
The theory of the bastida is not an educational method, but a tool that helps individuals who are new to a new experience of training, such as learning to use a new computer program or undertaking a new project.
Virtual bastides can be:
Virtual bastides are internalized in the software and are designed to question, show and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to do all alone.
Children are given in adoption for different reasons, from abandonment to abuse, from extortion to child molestation.
Children should not grow up in an environment where they are not fed, loved, and educated, but there are some who do.
We believe the family-care system is a form of safety for these children.
Our welfare system must provide safe homes, caring caretakers, stable healthcare and reliable support.
The welcoming party assumes all the needs that were not fulfilled in the house from which they were taken.
Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the use and reward of uses and gratifications.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important reasons for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Implication personal and "relations in progress" also became new motivating factors for Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the reaction of the public to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that you can detect whether a person is lying by analyzing their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage but still able to evaluate sincerity accurately.
Even dogs can be trained to recognize and respond to human emotions.
In the twentieth century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection eliminates it from the pool of variation that expresses itself.
Segregation and recombination combine variation forward and backward between the two genetic patrimoins in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its nutritional needs from the plants available.
The failure to achieve it has serious consequences: malnutrition, death and eventually decay of the economy.
The most common plant resources that are easy to obtain would be the proteins that are found in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, the humans.
The animals that produce animal protein (ants, termites, eggs) are digested easily, but they contain a great amount of essential amino acids that contain all the essential amino acids.
It is not surprising that our ancestors would solve their protein problem like today's chimpanzees do in the savanna.
The interruption of sleep is the process of getting up at a time other than the normal time of sleep and then returning to sleep again at a later time.
It is easy to do using a loud, quiet, and disruptive alarm clock that makes you aware but does not wake you completely.
If you are of those who reset their clocks while sleeping, try to put the clock on the other end of the room, so you have to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on the rhythms include drinking many liquids (especially water or tea) before going to bed, so that one is forced to urinate to keep up with the schedule.
The amount of peace that a person possesses is proportional to the amount of tension in body and spirit of one's self.
As the tension is lowered, the more positive force vital is present. Everyone has the potential to find peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing holding us back is our own negativity and tension.
The Tibetan Buddhist tradition is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was spread by the Mahayana and by many techniques of the Indian yoga.
In the beginning, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of the kundaliní yoga, meditation and the love of universal love.
With the Yoga Kundalini, you awaken the kundalini energy (illustrated energy) through postures of yoga, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The meditation center is the temple of the goddess.
World War II was the common enemy in the Second World War, which facilitated the collaboration between the United States and the Soviet Union. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes and cultures, and both countries were bitterly opposed.
Two years after the war was over, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
The war lasted for forty years and was fought in many places, including Africa, Asia, Cuba, and elsewhere, with armies sent from Africa to Asia, Cuba, and many other places.
The Poles had been penetrated on September 17, 1939, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup in the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were quickly obsolete as more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered and created the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, other international treaties, bilateral or multilateral agreements.
The use of ships to transport goods is, with a great deal, the most efficient method of transporting large amounts of goods and people across the oceans.
The job of the marines traditionally has been to ensure that your country maintains the capacity to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the capacity of your enemy to move people and goods.
The most recent example of a major campaign was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Concurrently, the German Navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have conquered Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
The first evidence of sheep and goats in the Middle East dates back to 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Cultures and tribes of ancient peoples began to domesticate them to obtain milk, meat, fur and skins.
Domestic sheep were kept in flocks that grazed on hills or other open areas, often watched by children who were often children. These methods of grazing still are used today.
The trains were built in England in the early 16th century.
The rails consisted of only planks of wood, which were tied together with horses to pull the wagons.
The rails were laid early in the construction of the railroad, and were soon covered with iron plates.
This practice became a regular occurrence, but the wooden wheels wore out faster than the iron wheels.
The first iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known form of transportation was walking, humans first began walking two million years ago with the emergence of the Homo erectus (which means human upright).
His ancestors, the australopitecs, did not walk upright.
Specializations in bipedalism in fossil australopitecs have been found in 4.2-3.9 million year old fossils of australopitecs, but australopitecs could have walked on two legs at most 7 million years ago.
We can start living in a more sustainable way with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce the suffering that could exist in the future.
This treatment is only effective as a symptom relief in most cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and we should be able to deactivate them.
The world has changed a lot because of the advancements in science and technology, and the problems have grown because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of humankind.
After its adoption by the House of Representatives on July 4, a written draft, signed by the president of the House, John Hancock, and the secretary of the House, Charles Thompson, was sent to the printer John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
During the night, a number of copies were made, which today are known as "Dunlap fliers".
The first public reading of the Declaration of Independence took place in Independence Hall's Great Hall on July 8, 1776.
A letter to George Washington was sent on June 6, 1776, and read to the troops in New York on June 9.
The 25 Dunlap brochures that still exist are the only known copies of this document. The original manuscript copy of this document is the only known copy that has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and that they are still alive.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many shots of birds that resemble a dinosaur.
They have scales with sharp edges and claws, and lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus rex.
The vast majority of computers that we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded in binary form.
A binary number can only have two possible values, which are 0 and 1, and these values are known as binary digits or bits, according to the computer jargon.
Intoxicació interna can be slow to show, so symptoms, like vomiting, are not always apparent immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning can be the presence of a medicine bottle or household chemicals.
Seek medical assistance specific to the poison specifically.
Insect is a formal term for this group of insects.
The term "bug" is derived from the insect family "Blattodea", which includes the xinxes.
The red-legged partridge and the house gecko are nidicolous, adapted to see in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the most common neurological disorder in young and adult middle-aged people.
Brain, spinal cord, and nerve damage are the main symptoms of multiple sclerosis.
The research has concluded that women have twice as many (2 times more) chances of getting MS than men.
A couple can decide to raise a child not to be the best for their own interests or the interests of their child.
These couples can choose to adopt a baby.
A parental adoption, the parents of birth end their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The primary purpose of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method.
Now, experimentation is not the only thing, and an experiment is not just a test; an experiment is also used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classics and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
The opinions of Aristotle on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge declined, the Orient became disconnected from its Greek roots and philosophy.
Many rhythms that are observed in the physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks are self-oscillating oscillators that maintain a steady state even in the absence of external signals.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fags, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the amount of genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are cells of the germinal line.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to the offspring, but mutations at any other site can cause cell death or cancer.
The tourism based on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the natural environment, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Each morning, people from small rural towns get in their cars and drive to their jobs.
In this dynamic vehicle everyone, of some way, is connected with, and supports, a system of mass transit based on private cars.
The science of climate change shows today that this massive coal economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of man for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses public transportation.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why public transportation systems fail to deliver on schedule, why do they fail to work? Is it that the engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
The Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individuals and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is hard to predict the driver's behavior with 100% certainty.
The traffic flow is usually relatively constant; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to be approximately constant.
To represent the flow of traffic, relationships have been made between the three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help planning, design, and operations of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape from enemies more easily and find food and a mate more effectively.
The majority of insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings around their bodies.
This makes them a great choice for hiding in small crevices.
Today, the only insects that can't fly are the efímera and the dragonfly.
About three thousand years ago, a man named Aristoteles said the solar system moved around the sun.
There was some who thought that what he said was true, but a lot of people thought the opposite; that the Solar System was moving away from Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because we don't have the sense that the Earth is moving, or is it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth. Transports 8 times more water than the second longest river on Earth.
Amazon River is the largest river in the world, at times it is six miles wide.
The 20% of water that flows from rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is the longest river in the world.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the pyramids of Gizah was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians were fascinated by the monuments of their forebears, which then had a thousand years.
The Vatican City State is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language of most people who live in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to mankind for millennia, in that they can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that all things are composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
He looked like the four matter states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, though according to his theory, they changed to become new substances that form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
The elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. It is clear that other metals like silver and gold also exist.
Alloys can also include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
All matter is made up of matter.
The atoms are so small that bilions of atoms would fit into the end of this sentence.
This invention of the pencil was a great friend of many people when it was invented.
Thankfully, with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status and uses.
Now people write messages on computer screens, without ever needing a pencil.
Can we only ask ourselves what the keyboard will become when something new emerges.
The fission bomb works by using the energy of a nuclear reaction to create a nuclear chain reaction that releases a lot of energy.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Separating the core of the cart releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break up when they collide with a small shock or no shock at all.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The outer layer of the oak tree is about 70 kilometers thick.
It is thinner under the moon and thicker under mountainous terrain.
It may be that there are more moons on the visible side of the moon because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to come out on the surface.
Theories of content focus on what interests or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what makes people want things that make them want things and what things in their environment will make them want things or not.
Two famous theories are the Maslow Theory of Human Needs and the Hertzberg Factors of Human Motivation.
In general, there are two behaviors that appear when the leaders start to lead their previous colleagues. One extreme is to try to follow as "a boy more" (or girl).
This kind of manager has trouble making decisions that are unpopular, applying discipline, carrying out assessments, assigning responsibilities and making others responsible for their own acts.
In the opposite case, one becomes a different person who feels that he or she has to change everything that has been going on the team and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is the overall responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in fistfights between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as their conventional counterparts, but with some small differences.
The members of a virtual group function as a point of contact for their physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than conventional teams, as their teams can meet in different time zones that the local director may not understand.
The presence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the team that each member of the team refers to.
Why would an organization want to spend the long process of establishing an organization learning organization? One of the goals for putting in place an organization learning organization is to innovate.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used effectively in functional departments of an organization.
In consequence, the work of an organization to overcome an adversity can lead to a process of innovation to respond to the need of the customer.
Because an organization can be innovative, leadership must create an innovation culture and knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuous approach as a method used by organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiophysical data provided proofs for a physical approach to cognition. As a result, the area of research is reduced and the research is made more accurate.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavioral disorders is supported by the work of scientists.
The brain is the largest organ in the human body and is responsible for controlling our bodily functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and data to build models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
The search in artificial intelligence involves making machines that can perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of these include control, planning, programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from the client, and recognition of writing, voice, and facial features.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on solving real-life problems.
The AI system now frequently used in the economy, medicine, engineering and military, as it has been built in many applications for personal computers and video games.
The theme trips are a major part of any class.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in museums, visit a fish aquarium or view the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Virtual journeys are a great way to reflect on a trip and share the experiences with future students.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is updated, but the older versions are kept online as a book of records.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
The blogs "push students to be more astute with the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The use of blogs can help students be more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of what they read on the internet and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics responding actively to internet materials (Oravec, 2002).

Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the eastern border with Rwanda.
The city was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano in 2002, which buried most of the streets of the city, especially the central business district.
Goma is relatively safe, but it would be wise to investigate before making any visits outside of this city to assess the state of the fighting that persists in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the lowest priced gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (cycle taxis) to move around in Goma. The price is normally around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
