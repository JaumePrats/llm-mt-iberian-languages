The Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM, for its English initials) are concerned about appearing "like Muppets."
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for its English initials).
The confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of all political spectrums are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Member of Parliament stated that his group was concerned that the word "twp" would be "left with Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: twp means &quot; twat &quot; and pwp means &quot; shit &quot; in Welsh.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that his group was "disappointed" and has suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member in Wales said his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the leap from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed strong support for calling a Parliament for Wales to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the option MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
The Members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could stall the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who would have to send the bill for the changes through in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the operation of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members and the design of the committee system.
The Members of the Assembly will have the final say on how the question of how to name them is decided.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the name change of the country.
Voters will decide on Sunday whether their country will be renamed "Republic of Macedonia North."
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has stated that he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin &apos; s Church are silent in Harlem
“Historically, older people I have spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“There is no either/or today.”
He noted that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
People now socialize in other ways, he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods that people regularly visit.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "at some point, they will have to go back to square one."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the type of people who would not help the remaining temples in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore they will accelerate the closing of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin in 1880.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped in the building acquired it.
A black congregation took over St. Martin &apos; s, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were resisting the hiring or promotion of blacks.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, while the congregation of Father Johnson made plans for its reconstruction, also commissioning the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martín, proudly called them "the poor man's campaigns."
In July, the expert playing the carillon called it a "cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument."
In addition, Tiffany Ng, a professor at the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who played the Riverside Church carillon 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the laity leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the parish governing body, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the parish council, although it had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiger shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the first day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child calling for help, so he and a group of divers went to rescue him.
Hammel commented that at first he thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then realized that he was "screaming that he had been bitten."
The boy had a broken collarbone, Hammel noted as he approached the child.
Hammel added, "I told everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark."
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children &apos; s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The Coast Guard, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper chest area.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's beauty plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff working in their style and beauty departments.
In order to significantly boost the United Kingdom's beauty market, valued at £2.8 trillion and growing at a rate higher than the decline in fashion and home sales, the largest beauty retailers will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
Investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that was once used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's doubled its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be expanded, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range, with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was recently opened in Croydon, south London, and the second of which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The rise of online shopping and the shift towards daily purchases of small quantities of food in local shops has forced supermarkets to work harder to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that supermarkets will increasingly resemble shopping malls as the chain tries to compete with Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores since it acquired these chains two years ago. It is believed that this has boosted food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion about how to split the income from the pharmacy counters in its supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of 281 pharmaceutical outlets to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is reported to be participating in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, was “furious” after television presenter Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the Truly fashion and accessories brand.
This business had compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving the business.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks &amp; Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the girl of gold from television admitted that her new deals, valued at up to £1.5 million, did not leave time for her Truly fashion and accessories brand.
The business had been compared to Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow and was being positioned as a favourite to double Willoughby &apos; s fortune of around £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving the business, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented, "Holly truly was, without question, the main priority of Holly.
It was to be her long-term future, which would keep her in the next two decades.
Their decision to leave left everyone involved completely stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow, ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning &apos; s star presenter could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly delay its launch further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for the past 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The Joneses went on vacation together and Jones has a 40 % stake in Baldwin &apos; s television production company.
Willoughby is to become the face of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A close friend of Jones said last night "we didn't talk business."
A difficult conversation &quot;and then we fell in love &quot;
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump spoke in his mock-newsman voice.
“I have not given up anything.”
Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world's assembled leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country is not seeing an "adequate" response from the United States to its first steps towards denuclearization of North Korea.
In contrast, he noted that the United States was still applying sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump &apos; s speech was much more optimistic than his campaign rhetoric.
He said, "We get along great with North Korea."
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a fantastic relationship now.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to the issue of relations with Kim.
It is very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we would have about 200 people right here.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for international aid to be mobilized.
Mrs. Sumbung explains that "unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, which makes things a little more difficult."
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palu, it is still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations would be allowed to provide assistance.
Given that Indonesia is a country where the land is constantly in motion, the country remains woefully unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami sirens in Palu, even with an early warning, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
Traveling from one island of Indonesia to another is a major challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the new disaster enclave.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia &apos; s worn-out infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who faces re-election next year.
It must also contend with the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim community have adopted a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, equals the score for Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea &apos; s goal when the score was 1-0.
He kicked the ball with his left foot before striking it with his right.
The action was directed over the area and then to the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
Sturridge was trying to get himself into that position to get the ball and the players ahead of him, like Shaq always does, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible.
I saw Kante coming and gave him a tap on the shoulder. I didn &apos; t think about it too much, I just fired.
Chelsea was leading 1-0 at the half after Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' equaliser was a neat one-two between Mateo Kovacic and Riyad Mahrez, before the latter cut inside and fired a low shot into the Liverpool goal.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle.
After that, Hazard made a nice move to the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished with a left-footed shot that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
Liverpool plays Napoli at 15:00 on Wednesday in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Indonesian disaster agency at the beginning of Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency &apos; s spokesman, told a press briefing.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested by police as a suspect in the murder of a woman who was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in her murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
In addition, I would recommend that anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured dashcam footage contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
Some people who claim to know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim &apos; s family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that nobody can enter or leave the building.
He was left bewildered when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now being informed that they will be allowed back in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was seen crying at the site.
It keeps repeating "it is terrible."
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained inside the cordon controlling the apartment block.
Any person with information should contact Merseyside Police on 101, Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, registration 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament Square is the last commemorative success story in "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious artefacts and objects in England carried out by its puritanical fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick &apos; s suggestions as &quot; madness &quot; and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure from Westminster Palace would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed on the altar of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The magnificent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft Cromwell is a testament to the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith noted in The Sunday Telegraph: &quot; Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If it is a completely accurate description, then the historical debate must continue.
What is true is that the mid-17th-century conflict has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of commemoration and celebration.
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a livestock dealer at a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he left his home province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market in the neighbouring province of Yunnan.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a big pig with blood on its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
The legs of my cousin were bleeding and broken, he said, to The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was kept in a pen to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
It appears that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for Yuan &apos; s death.
Although rare, pigs have attacked people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it away.
After pigs ate a rancher in Oregon in 2012, a rancher in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What is needed is the appropriate respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the south-west of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters off the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Hurricane Rosa, a category 1 hurricane, formed on Sunday morning (Eastern Daylight Time) and was located about 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressures are starting to develop in the Pacific, moving eastward toward the West Coast of the United States.
Roses will leave more than 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical rain meets the approaching low-pressure system, widespread heavy rain will occur in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible desert slides.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation rates of almost 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially in Arizona.
Because of the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall, sudden and rapid flooding may occur.
Due to the threat of tropical cyclones, it is not recommended to travel in the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms could cause local dust devils and sandstorms.
The approaching low-pressure system will bring heavy rains to specific parts of the southern California coast.
Heavy rains may leave as much as two inches of water, which could cause small debris flows and make roads slippery.
This would be the first heavy rains of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before becoming widespread by late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intense temperature changes will be observed in the United States in October as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
Sometimes, this means drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences will be seen across the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will attempt to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, October is expected to start off with a warm spell, with temperatures generally in the mid-to-upper 20s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term outlook indicates above-average chances of temperatures exceeding normal for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony.
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault, on Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political situation remained deadlocked, and the media interrupted their regular programming to cover the latest developments from Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had groped her while she was drunk and that he had tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 per cent sure that that had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who watched Nielsen on Friday saw it.
The company tracked the average audience for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels that carried it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has some problems in calculating how many people see something in the office.
For perspective, it is a crowd similar to that of a playoff or Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh, the cable channel leader, with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers for a full day of testimony, Nielsen noted.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had $3.1 billion, NBC had $2.94 billion, MSNBC had $2.89 billion and CNN had $2.52 billion.
Following the presentation, there was a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the morning of Friday, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
While receiving these criticisms, which were broadcast live on CNN, he appeared dejected.
One woman said, "Looking me in the face."
“Are you telling the truth to the country?”
He continued: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a press release and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say to the Commission.
Cable and broadcast television aired everything live hours later, when the Senate Judiciary Committee had to vote to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake &apos; s decision was critical, as it became clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of "playing politics"
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, will address the Conservative Party Conference to be held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the newspaper's front page, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to share customs duties was "completely absurd".
Wayde murder: LSU player Dyteon Simpson arrested by police as suspect in death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson &apos; s DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 bond has been set, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head that had entered the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police crime laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the police in the area for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 7-foot-1 player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade declared his team "devastated" and "shocked" by the death of Wayde Sims.
“These are the things that people always worry about,” Wade commented.
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed signs of activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre has experienced several earthquakes and tremors.
In social media, images showed thin layers of ash coating the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo," has been active since 1994.
The police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after anti-riot police clashed with pro-independence demonstrators as thousands of people took part in rival anti-referendum protests on the first anniversary of the polarised Catalan independence vote.
A group of masked separatists who had been stopped by the riot police hurled eggs and powder at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes later in the day and the police used truncheons to quell the fighting.
For several hours, the independence groups, with messages such as "no forgiveness, no forgetting," faced off against unionists, shouting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrated.
The voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, as those opposed to secession boycotted the referendum in large numbers.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, where there were violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife said that he had lost hope that Catalonia would ever become independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a narrow victory in the December regional elections, the procatalanist parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone, said the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
He said, &quot; The situation is getting increasingly tense.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be running in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Standing for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for crashing car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday, 19:30, at Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there was damage to the access and the building itself.
At some point, the car may have been shot with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gave Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured the victory
A Livingston promoted to impress Rangers at the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of Rangers.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's goals moved the Hibernian up a notch, to second place.
This season, Gerrard have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, the league leaders with an eight-point lead.
Earlier, Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its winning streak to six games in the division.
Livingston lets a visitor down
The Holt team had to have been a step ahead much earlier, causing all kinds of problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence, but failed to score from close range in front of goal. Alan Lithgow then had a shot deflected after he had gone in to score from Craig Halkett &apos; s header.
The visiting team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their dead-ball play.
Thus, the decisive blow was struck.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston looked for an opening, with a combined play from Declan Gallagher and Robinson to Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that time, Rangers dominated possession, but were unable to break down the host keeper, Liam Kelly, who was quite calm.
That game continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stoppage.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers &apos; goalkeeper, blocked a shot from Scott Pittman with a kick, and Livingston was unable to get another shot off.
There were long passes into the Livingston area constantly, but they were always cleared out. Two penalty appeals were rejected, one after Halkett's shot on substitute Glenn Middleton and one after a hand.
Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The consensus is that they played a superb game that exceeded expectations of an upward trajectory.
Its style of play and its roster have changed little since its ascension, but that is largely due to Holt, who has bolstered the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was huge and led a well-organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good moments with Gerrard, they came up short.
They failed to materialize their plays, as they only managed to penetrate the opposition's half of the field once, which is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
Smiles and blue skies were in evidence on Saturday, 29 September, at the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey &apos; s EU membership.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons for preventing 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
These manifestations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a road accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, to the south-east of the city, at 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended to by the paramedics, but he died there and then.
The accident occurred after another cyclist was killed after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in disturbances
Six prison officials were injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the director of the prison.
The disturbances began at Long Lartin prison, in Worcestershire, at 9.30 a.m. on Sunday and are still continuing.
A crack team of elite specialists (known as "Tornado") is being deployed to control the disturbances, involving eight inmates and affecting a wing.
The agents received minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman commented: "Specialist prison staff have been deployed to deal with the current incident at HMP Long Lartin."
Six staff members have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.”
Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital care after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, prison officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which prison staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep through the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern Nevada and eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of torrential rain, which can reach 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 inches, with the possibility of up to 10 inches in isolated areas, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rains are considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, part of these torrential rains may be beneficial due to the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 % of Arizona is suffering, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula.
Hurricane Rosa, which is expected to be a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 136 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm is running into cooler waters in the Pacific, and is losing strength.
It is expected to hit Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at risk of flooding.
“Heavy rains of 7 to 15 inches are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 inches,” as reported by weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression.
The main danger to Rosa or its remains is the torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and southwest United States.
These rains are expected to cause sudden flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Four arrested in Midsomer Norton for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects in an attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, at about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was moved to a hospital, where he remains "stable."
Three 17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to the Avon and Somerset Police.
The agents have called on anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh &quot; suffered the meanness and anger &quot; of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the despicable and disgusting tactics of the Democrat Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this allegation.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, "Americans saw the shrewdness, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our time, a lawyer with an admirable record of public service,” he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The President made indirect references to the Kavanaugh nomination in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not running, but I am a candidate,” he said.
That is why I go from one place to another, fighting to get great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to a senior Republican official at the Republican National Committee.
Hundreds of people killed in a quake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in the city of Palu to celebrate a festival on Friday night when waves as high as six metres came ashore in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When yesterday it was reported that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, by its Indonesian initials) at a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, and everything on land, &quot; it moved at 800 km/h in the open sea before hitting the coast, &quot; Nugroho said.
He added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The coastal city was still being battered by the storm on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in a population of 2.4 million.
The BPPT, the Indonesian agency for technology assessment and application, reported in a press release that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which is built on the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "serious" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300 000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the agency's officials say that the waves had already reached the coast by the time the alert was issued.
In a recording made by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard warning people on the street below that a tsunami is approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout in the surrounding areas of Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city &apos; s airport has been reopened for relief and rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centres of Paul on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is higher than 800.
That is very bad.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala had arrived safely in Palu, where they were sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they had seen a devastating scene on their way there, Mr. Doseba said.
He said, "They told me they had seen many houses destroyed."
That is very bad.
Even as the aid groups were putting the machinery of disaster assistance into motion, some people were complaining that experienced relief workers were not being allowed to go to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, only a disaster area declared a national disaster zone may be eligible for foreign financing, supplies and personnel.
And that has not yet happened.
Aulia Arriani, the Indonesian Red Cross spokesperson, said, &quot; It is still a disaster at the provincial level.
As soon as the Government says that it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but it has not happened yet.
Friends and relatives of the missing persons in Palu still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the stories of natural disasters.
A small child was rescued from a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother.
Gendon Subandono, a parapente instructor for the Indonesian national team, had trained two of the missing parapenters for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other students of his were also caught up in the hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
"My own emotional baggage is a burden I carry," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, their messages only showed a grey checkmark, not two blue checkmarks.
"That means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves made off with $26,750 during a cash-out at a Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, two armed robbers held up a Brink employee who was loading an ATM at Newport on the Levee, making off with $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM machine located in the entertainment district and was preparing to reload it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was occupied, another man "came running up behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money intended for reloading.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person with information about their identities should contact Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West will now be known as Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time now, a name he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance due to "emotional reasons," as the creator of the show commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously stated that the word had a religious significance for him.
West said he believes the word is the most used in the Bible, meaning "you."
"I am you, you are me, we are one."
Kanye became Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, Jay-Z, has used his name in all caps or lower case, with or without a hyphen.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing them with monthly stipends for those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I. A.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by various parts of the U.S. Government, even when, in general, the United States lacks an official I. A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in IA by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I. A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging far behind the United States in this area,” says Lee.
Double the funding means double the chances of the next great achievement in the United States, as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book &quot; AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order &quot; was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China &apos; s most important I. A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed a system of I. A. that defeated the best American player of Othello.
He commended the previous technological competitions of the United States Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It is not China that is taking the lead from the academics; it is the corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent academics to work in I. A.
Lee commented that changes in U.S. immigration policy could also help intensify U.S. efforts in I. A.
“I think that doctors in I. A. should be given permanent residence cards automatically,” he said.
The Chinese State Council released its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) funds people at academic institutions as well as other government agencies and foundations, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In early 1996, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is designed to attract partners from industry and academia. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in a new initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 million per year in research in the physical sciences.
Meanwhile, the United States has been unable to take any action on the proposed National Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change their name.
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name should change to "Republic of Macedonia North," a move that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents maintain that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Slavic population in Macedonia, the majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50 % required to make the referendum valid.
The referendum ballot asked the following question: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, aged 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, many members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote so that it will be decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared at 1 p.m. that no irregularities had been reported.
However, voter turnout was only 16 % in comparison to the 34 % turnout in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, said: &quot; I am here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe. &quot;
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko Zaev cast their votes in the referendum on the name change of the country, which would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents set up by those who were boycotting the referendum.
Kavadarkov said, "We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door."
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that joining NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, whose unemployment rate is over 20 per cent.
Zaev said that he believed that the majority would be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of citizens were in favour of the EU and NATO.
He said that a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future."
A survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Studies claimed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which would be lower than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57 % of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, evades the entire Brighton defence to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a yellow card in the first few minutes of the match.
He ran between three Brighton defences before breaking into open country.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded one defence before outrunning several more in the Brighton area.
He made a left turn onto Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch to return the ball to Agüero, who struck it with his right foot to avoid the goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot that hit the right side of the goal.
“Agüero has a few problems with his foot,” said Pep Guardiola, the City coach, to the press.
We are talking about 55 to 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky to score at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave Manchester City the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
The winning goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton goal.
He had a nice run down the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave Sterling a few pointers before sending him to the second pole.
The Sky blue striker headed the ball just outside the penalty area before it went out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday, 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies &apos; party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have playoff chances.
The Rockies at least secured one wildcard spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still chasing their first division title.
Although we didn &apos; t have anything to lose, at least we could go out there and know that the Denver crowd would be excited and that the other team would probably play at the highest level I &apos; ve faced this year.
Why wouldn &apos; t you want to participate?
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it looks like they are leaning towards letting Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, which will be its 34th, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to its normal rest on Sunday.
The record of the Washington wizard is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 entrances.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation, his selection to the Supreme Court, when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
In November, everything we have done is at stake.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I am not running, but I am fighting for great candidates, and I go from one place to another to do so.
He continued: "We have a terrible radical group of Democrats, they are now in power.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and we see the meanness, the evil.
They do not care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control.
The democrats, he said, were engaged in a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
He said, "We have seen it these last four days, the Democrats were furious, they were bad, they were horrible and they were false."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by nominating Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his reply?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I hope you have an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.
The Labour Party now encompasses a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who speak their minds
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a long line of Labour MPs who are told that we are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in the House of Commons, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way to be categorically anti-Semitic.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with a responsible economic policy, on security matters, for Europe. It is ironic that it was issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more friendly and compassionate" policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever was implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether or not the party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to radically change his mind and adopt positions with which he had never been comfortable, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one to have experienced this.
I am indeed fortunate to be more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as my comments tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist insults, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have such a wide range of opinions and, with every "censure" motion or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice to keep my head down and not make too much noise, so that I would be "all right."
But I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a schoolboy, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, and I have never hidden them in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions and areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday that I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will stop me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an Ayr invincible at the top
Two late tries by Ayr may have decided the final outcome, but without doubt Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match.
They are now the top team in the league and the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end, it was the team's superior defence and ability to make the most of opportunities that gave them the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased with his team.
“We have been tested in all the parties and we are still standing, so I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, commented: "Ayr deserves the recognition, they took the opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson &apos; s conversion at the 14th minute gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, on loan from the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opposition and Jason Baggot converted a penalty kick.
Climax extended its lead with a penalty kick just before halftime, and then converted it into a solo try, leaving the score at 17-5 in favour of Climax at the break.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson &apos; s essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
There was a long interruption after Ruaridh Knott was carried off on a stretcher with a serious injury, and Ayr went on to win the game with a converted try by Stafford McDowall.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having one more man with a non-converted Bruce Colvin, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the premises were recovered and, when Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for not playing the ball, from the line of a penalty, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul, advancing.
The weather, as it had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe kicked the ball off David Armstrong's boot and sent Gregor Henry into the corner for the fifth time, had turned the game.
The Still Game star wants to pursue a career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, appears to be determined to move into the catering business after it was revealed that he had been appointed as the director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC programme, which he writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and Kiernan appears to be making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source at the Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming Glasgow restoration market."
Bolivia without a coast: hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Naval headquarters are located in La Paz.
Blue flags wave in public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right,
“To recover it is a duty.”
In all of Bolivia, a land without a sea, the lost coast to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the nineteenth century, as well as the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean again, are still vividly remembered.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and calm, and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision, commented Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice verdict on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has an obligation to negotiate for Bolivia to gain sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is embroiled in a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about Monday's resolution.
In late August, he promised that the country was "very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the tribunal will rule in Bolivia &apos; s favour and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice issued its final ruling only six months after the final submissions indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Chilean expert Paz Zárate, in international law.
Far from promoting Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
The problem of access to the sea had been seized by the current Bolivian administration, he said.
He also suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to keep the conversation going after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and to put an end to 139 years of mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see what we need to leave behind.”
North Korea says it will not give up nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to give up nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made at a summit meeting in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when Mike Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy talks that have been stalled for more than three months since this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
He said that the continuation of the ongoing sanctions and the United States &apos; opposition to a declaration that would end the Korean War and bring the North to its knees was a "pipe dream."
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without some meaningful disarmament movement from Pyongyang first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is a widespread scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang &apos; s disarmament, which the country may regard as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo has planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of enormous hats about to land on a street of shops near you.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the runway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large complements included a watermelon with jewels, a witch &apos; s hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of wild masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-on lips and bore more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation recalled a full diving team, snorkel and goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you are in luck.
The hat trend forecasters predict that the huge hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
Big hats are back in a big way, thanks to "La Bomba," a 60-centimetre-wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The hat that became so popular on social media also featured another creation on the runway: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini that was carrying it.
The orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringe and a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at the Paris Fashion Week.
As stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: &quot;Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on the streets of the high street. Since the designer has had such a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories.&quot;
John Edward: linguistic skills are vital for citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a long history of academic excellence, which has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the examinations, which is further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for its acronym in English), strive to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy in the world.
As a modern language, popular and in demand in the centres, modern languages continue to be a subject of choice for students.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his native language, that goes to his heart."
If you speak to them in their language, you reach their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if one wishes to establish relations and build trust with people from other countries, one cannot rely solely on English.
If we look at the recent results of the examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
Overall, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centres that make up the SCIS, showed that 72 % of students achieved an A in Mandarin, while 72 % of students studying German, French and Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that will be needed by children and young people in the future without doubt.
Languages are now considered on a par with the CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere else.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 per cent of employers cited language skills as a barrier to filling jobs.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly indispensable for preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential for language skills in the workplace is increasing, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career path someone chooses, if he or she has learned a second language, he or she will have a real advantage in the future because of this, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give that person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and 15 per cent spoke only French.
For this reason, investing in language education is important for today &apos; s children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be better equipped to have better opportunities for quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the more important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child's interests, independent schools will always offer a choice of languages taught by specialist staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children for life and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future holds.
In a global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered "competencies for international communication."
Independent schools in Scotland will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people.
Well, that is that.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron James makes his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for the fans who are waiting to see LeBron James make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Luke Walton, the Lakers &apos; head coach, announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes to be played is still to be determined.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton commented on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers &apos; preseason six-game schedule.
At this stage of his career, he said, he did not need preseason parties to prepare.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five Trump campaign rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court in the run-up to the midterm elections, Trump is seeking support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump &apos; s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
President Trump &apos; s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time this Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view it online via a live YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was dogged by sexual misconduct allegations and has left the Senate waiting for a vote of confirmation for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of these rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections to gain momentum.
As Reuters reported, the Trump campaign is holding five rallies next week to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House," according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while campaigning, a Trump campaign aide told Reuters, who declined to be named.
The rally scheduled for tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage from Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and push him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
The United States team shows that it is willing to fight to keep the flame of hope alive in the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
Where do you think the impetus is now?
Jordan Spieth, who finished the day with a four-point lead, said: "We were six points down and now we are four, so I guess that is a little bit of a push."
Europe has a clear advantage: four points ahead with 12 more to play for.
As Spieth notes, the Americans feel they have something of a tailwind and plenty of reasons to be cheerful, among other reasons, by the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and managed three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and preaches with his example.
The guttural roars of celebration grew louder as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt for Thomas and Thomas to tie the fourth round when they were two down with two to play.
The putt that gave the Americans the lead in the 15th was greeted with a similar cry, one that said that the Americans still had not been knocked out.
"What we need to do is redouble our efforts and focus on the party," said Spieth.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes to leave your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable couple of Europe are four for four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only pair that did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
This run of form and the energy it brings with it when it plays in front of a noisy crowd makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players more popular than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun goes down at Le Golf National.
Preferably, two holes in different locations.
Nevertheless, it is premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help on Sunday to get out of the holes.
The foursomes and fourballs are fascinating to watch up close because of the interplay between the couples, the advice given and not given, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team is willing to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe started the final day of the Ryder Cup with a good lead after finishing the foursomes and fourballs with a score of 10-6 over the United States.
The Fleetwood-Molinari duo led the contest with two wins over Tiger Woods, who was in trouble, gaining four points in the Le Golf National standings.
Europe's Thomas Bjorn, trying to hold on to the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a U.S. team that made many errors during the foursomes in the morning, which ended 3-1.
The United States won two foursomes, but failed to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points. He and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership served to beat a dejected Woods and the American rookie Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who had been a bit of a non-factor in the two parties on Saturday, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world #1 and #3 players respectively, 2-1.
Although the weather was pleasant and calm in the southwest of Paris, Europe was not having all its own way.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas served as a reference point for the Americans, who earned two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has ever recovered from a four-point deficit in the individual matches, but Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second-best team for two days, it seems that a comeback on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is "no possibility" of unilateral disarmament if it does not have confidence.
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his country &apos; s mistrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country &apos; s unilateral nuclear disarmament under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly at its annual meeting that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology control.
However, we have not received any similar response from the United States.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of unilateral disarmament.
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington &apos; s resistance to a &quot; phased &quot; denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, as it does not reject unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an American president in office and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working towards &quot; denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula &quot; and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official goal of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can be trusted.
Washington has also resisted calls for softening international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a declaration of war termination.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.
Kim did not mention any plans for a second Trump-Kim summit, announced with great fanfare by the United States leader at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party interested in nuclear disarmament instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri's tone was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles to American soil after "malign" President Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim "rocket man."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in moving towards disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and that sanctions should continue to be applied until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years, five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, "The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize a complete and verifiable denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions unanimously on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang &apos; s ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but North Korea later denounced his "demands as those of a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantling a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States implemented "appropriate measures."
He said that Kim had told him that the "measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep
Thanks to a new course being offered this year at Harvard University, all university students are now sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of all-night caffeine-fuelled cramming.
A professor at the world &apos; s number one university discovered that students there often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, one girl came up to me and asked why she was just hearing about this now, in her last year.
He said that nobody had ever told him the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of good sleep habits and how they contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos; s health services, noted that the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a routine for going to bed.
In another section, participants are informed that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that students will not change their behaviour overnight.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as any of us has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He stated that the culture of "pulling an all-nighter" still exists and added that modern technology and increased pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good night &apos; s sleep should be the &quot; secret weapon &quot; of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
The next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler &apos; s recommendation is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by screens and LEDs, which can disrupt circadian rhythms, so that they will have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal sinks Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another away-day depression when the attack of Dolly Menga saw the disjointed Steven Gerrard team go down 1-0 to Livingston.
Rangers wanted their first away win since February 4 &apos; s 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt &apos; s team defeated them for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga &apos; s attack came just minutes before half-time and Rangers &apos; poor alignment was never in question.
Now, Rangers drop to sixth, Livingston to third, behind Hibernian by the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as judge of the line Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after allegedly being hit with an object from the visitor side.
Gerrard changed eight of the players who won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, took 11 Livingston players who drew a point off Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-drilled team dominated their opponents throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when he had it.
They should have marked the two minutes of the game when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman that went through the defence, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent it out.
Keaghan Jacobs was penalized for a high stick on Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner on defence, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send it out of the zone.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their chances in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian appeals.
Rangers scored twice in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly barely had to break sweat to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livingston &apos; s goal in the 34th minute was against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a deep pass from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to mark the goal.
In the rest, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, who had an almost immediate impact, as he passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block it.
However, Livingston continued to lead the visitors exactly to the type of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing a long pass after long pass.
Holt could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow rounded a corner to win by a head.
The Rangers substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty late in the game after a run-in with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and counting...
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film &quot; The Singing Cowboy &quot;, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, at the age of 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can &quot; see &quot; a common protein in many cancers and re-inject it.
A vaccine trial is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can &quot; see &quot; a common protein called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes growth of different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancerous cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into a Twitter spat in favour of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It did not work out.
Kanye West was booed in the Saturday Night Live studio after a performance that was erratic, with the rapper praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often speak to white people who ask me how I can like Trump, who is racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago, he said.
SNL began its program with a sketch of Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Though it was not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded the rant to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West said that he had had a hard time backstage wearing that hat.
They messed with me.
They told me not to wear my hat.
They got me!
And then they tell me I am asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see me asleep?" and added that he was "going to put on his superman cape, because that meant nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Try with love.
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety, which reported that one person told the magazine, "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died recently.
West shocked many when he came out on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
I may decide not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) whom I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology in my community.
He is free.
We also have &quot; We can &quot;, added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The Attorney General will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero on screen, saying that those roles often transmitted to young boys that they had to be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he thinks "it's quite important" to address this issue.
“Personally, I think it is quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?”, he said.
What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they now face?
Kit believes that television may have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young people feel that they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any spin-offs or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will be starring in True West, the play by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
He recently revealed that knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he has taken away from Game of Thrones.
He met his wife on the show, so in that sense, he has given his future family and life from now on.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of these were sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way has been reduced to a practical zero, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB community suffers much discrimination.
Because of the country &apos; s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data on Republican senators and calls the allegations "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Representative Maxine Waters, D-Calif., criticized the allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that those allegations were being pushed by commentators and websites on the "far right."
Waters commented on Twitter, "Lies, damned lies, and statistics."
The information published allegedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted information on the Internet during a Senate panel hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office, and the Capitol reported the data of a Waters staff member.
That accusation was "completely false and a total lie," he said.
The individual whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a total lie.
Waters &apos; s statement generated immediate criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote, "I am outraged by this information."
This suggests that the necessary temperance for membership in Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
Do not rebel.
The accuser should not be questioned.
“Keep calm and carry on.”
It appears that Fleischer was comparing Waters's reaction to the Kavanaugh hearing to the Democrats' criticisms of Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican Omar Navarro, who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If that is true, it is very serious.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations."
“We will ensure that the authors are identified and held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all my staff members,” he said.
Johnny English: Again in Action. Rowan Atkinson's spy spoof is a bit of a letdown
Brexit has now become a tradition to seek out guffs in any new British-themed film. It seems that this is what is expected of this new Johnny English franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this ironic self-satire about how clearly ridiculous we are become the new export opportunity for the nation?
Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and blank face, has renewed his licence to make a fool of himself for the second time. His name alone gives clues that he is a comic creation aimed at territories where English is not the first language.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent, despite its odd claims of glamour, who has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that type who touched on the theme of Cars 2 at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In its original form, it was based on the mysterious man traveller and international figure, made famous by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television adverts, causing chaos in its wake.
There are a couple of good moments in this last installment.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armour while the rotors were smashing into the hull.
Atkinson &apos; s gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humour is disappointingly thin and superfluous, especially now that franchises of 007 and Mission: Impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
The humour seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, the absurd misadventures of Johnny English are not as clever and well-timed as the silent jokes of Atkinson as Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated Britain &apos; s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent in the field, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
The Prime Minister is a pompous and cornered figure, and is seeing her popularity in the polls sink: Emma Thompson gives her best as this character, almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That would be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, although he gives informal lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy like the one in Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old friend Bough, now represented by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submariner captain, a role that he does not exploit enough with Vicki Pepperdine.
The Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of Her Majesty are back in action, with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a charismatic multi-millionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain &apos; s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
The last sequence was definitely the most heavily employed, but, however much it may be grating and noisy, the whole sequence still conveys a rather childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I could not help but wonder whether the British film industry could give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for Britons to work four days a week and be paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan whereby Britons would work four days a week, but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the owners of AI companies to give their workers an additional day off, with the savings from AI being used to do so.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
The idea "fits" with the party's economic plans and agenda, and would tilt the country towards the workers.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party figure told The Sunday Times: &quot; We expect a revision of the directive before the end of the year.
The four-day working week is a definite goal for the party, but one that it hopes to achieve in the longer term.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this type of idea, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, not all Labour Party members support this decision at present.
A labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and will not be discussed at this time."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was prepared to reclaim powers from "anonymous directors" and "crony capitalists" in companies that provided public services.
One of the shadow minister &apos; s plans is to ensure that current shareholders in water companies do not recover their full stake, as a Labour government might apply deductions to reflect the irregularities detected.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds from 10 % of private sector companies &apos; shares for employees, which would yield annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has at least delayed by at least a week the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice, and raises the question of whether the results of the investigation could influence any Republican senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could produce information that would change their minds.
Senator Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this had happened, after the allegation had come out, and I asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, and unyielding.
Graham, however, seems to be a rock.
I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would just ignore the accusation.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it flatly," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the persons named by the Commission has been able to confirm this.
It has been 36 years.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive roster of stars in support of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be educated on the real purpose of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively engaged in fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they can afford a VIP ticket), concert-goers have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions," such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other activity that helps to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of "clicktivism", which is the term we use for the stance we take when we think we are doing something really useful by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favour of a wide range of goals.
Through these actions, they claim to have secured commitments and policies worth over US$37 billion from global leaders, which will impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group has cited 390 commitments and announcements that have emerged from its actions, of which at least 10 billion $ has been disbursed or pledged.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly impacted almost 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition," a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom, united by a common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential." To this end, $35 million has been proposed to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and Global Citizens partners, we can make a small dent in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador for "The Power of Nutrition," to the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claimed that, after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions asked on our website about what we think can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
One Global Citizen respondent said, "It will be a long and hard road, and we will stumble and fall many times along the way.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have shown, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the acts we will have at the New York event this year, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out the energy export embargo on Russia - Department of the Interior
Washington could &quot; if necessary &quot; call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up markets, including the Middle East, according to U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the alliance between Russia and Syria, in particular where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is just a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the most southern supplier of Europe.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and means of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, in extreme cases, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the consumer voice in energy policy in the United States."
He compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to exploit and replace fossil fuels," he warned, adding that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made as the Trump administration has been trying to push liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted throughout that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, worth $11 billion and intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington &apos; s fierce opposition to the project is only economic in nature and is yet another example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with Rick Perry, the United States Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The United States position, however, has met with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry organization that leads the industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a major problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider a run for the presidency in 2020, she says.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a presentation at the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to mend our fractured government and finally have women in leadership, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider running for the presidency.
Warren gave her opinion on President Donald Trump during a speech at City Hall and said that "he is taking the country down the wrong path."
He said, "I really worry about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy."
Warren spoke without hesitation about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
However, a majority of Warren voters themselves do not believe that he should run for office in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll, 58 per cent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said Senator Kerry should not run.
However, 32 per cent of those surveyed did support his candidacy.
The survey showed a greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of respondents supporting a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other Democratic Party members spoke about the possible candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for 2020.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin &apos; s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
The situation that my son is going through, everything that has happened since he returned, is very well known to the other families that suffer the effects of TEPT and other wounds suffered by our soldiers, &quot; she said to the crowd that gathered in a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the "biggest taboo nobody wants to talk about," and commented on her son and other veterans of war that "they come home with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a domestic violence complaint and possession of firearms under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of developing a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial challenge to the new United States policy that denies asylum to domestic violence and gang victims.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a "friendly" letter to Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum-seeker who is currently facing the current directive, reported NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" filed in August by the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) against the federal policy was not revealed.
She said that her partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum requests to the United States, as nations facing generalized problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States reversed a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum in this country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine made statements on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum applications must be decided on the facts and circumstances of the particular case and, instead, this exception violates that principle.
The lawyers also noted that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide a needed workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to domestic violence and gang violence victims in June.
Asylum seekers can apply for asylum if they leave their countries of origin because of persecution or threats of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, let alone all the serious problems, that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us that the situation was very tense as she tried to comfort her feverish baby at a relief centre in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean drinking water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to salvage what few belongings they have left in an effort to recover what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside the building because of the continuing aftershocks, which were also very strong.
She could not help but cry as she told us about the violent earthquake she had experienced while on the 5th floor of the hotel with her husband and daughter.
We had no time to get out.
I was trapped in the rubble, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I don &apos; t know what has happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper promoting mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China was published by a Chinese official newspaper, the United States ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely read newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, something China denies.
Trump &apos; s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence American elections marked a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led both sides to raise tariff levels on imports from each other.
The Chinese retaliatory tariffs that were in place at the start of the trade war were designed to hit the states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China &quot; is intensifying this pressure with advertisements in our free press."
In an effort to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press to try to place an ad in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, in the newsstand on the street where we are in Beijing, there are only a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China may have on the troubling trajectory that their economy is taking, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that "one of China &apos; s most influential newspapers had declined to publish" his article, but did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts note that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm election with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are rallying behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially among women, could occur in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been intense, and many Republicans have expressed their desire to move forward with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday that "we can't go back on this."
Reeher doubted that Senator Jeff Flake &apos; s (R-Arizona) last attempt to position himself in favour of the FBI &apos; s investigation would be enough to calm disgruntled voters on this issue.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow, or in November," said senior adviser and national spokesperson for progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered outside the Senate were chanting "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) as the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by The Hill.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is way beyond any prediction," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
People say that the impact is already very significant, and indeed it is.
But it could be even higher, especially among indecisive women from the outer suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote, even though they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had indicated that a backlash could occur if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party," former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News early last week, as reported.
"It is not just a question of the committee vote and the final vote, or even whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench; it is also about how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know whom to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are now on Kavanaugh &apos; s side.
In a new YouGov poll, 41 per cent of respondents said they believed Ford &apos; s testimony definitively or probably, while 35 per cent said they believed Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent said that Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30 per cent said the same of Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford &apos; s statements, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee and indicated that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while both were drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend. A company based on the open-source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "to rule the world."
He said, "It has to be now," about the startup.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid technology to enable users to create their own "online personal data locker" or POD.
It may contain lists, lists of tasks pending, the music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique to online personal data storage is that the user is completely in control of who can access what type of information.
The company calls this "personal data training."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's chief executive officer, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach the world.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers on staff who worked on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team is not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce a radical change where all their business models are going to be completely changed overnight."
We are not going to ask for permission.
Inrupt, as described in a Medium post on Saturday, is "a commercial energy provider and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even though Berners-Lee is launching Inrupt, he will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added, "I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web."
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only English clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren found a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "a particularly symbolic find" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under intense machine-gun and artillery fire."
He then ran the line to the enemy line and, with the "greatest bravery," advanced the line to a single trench and knocked out three of the enemy with one hand.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather &apos; s actions were &quot; so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very instructive.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade and added that the value of a true hero was evident when he was shown such a strong show of support.
The MMA faithful stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 only to be denied the main event.
The San José billboard had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was to be broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face off, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up late to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a big joke."
There is government regulation of what is broadcast after 6 a.m., and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when we asked him about the change.
""Peppa the Pig", yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will be changing the format to include British viewers in future editions.
When I think about the option of a live broadcast, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it is at 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are seeing how to do that.
Believe me, when the programming changed, we received a great deal of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because we thought it was a technical problem at first.
But it was a government problem.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is the usual number, in order to give more than usual to the fans, who were happy.
That is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but that was what drove him to become a champion.
At 24, she told us that she did not realize until she went to secondary school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that her intention in talking about gay rights was to "transmit hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to lose interest in winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this legendary show, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first Laverne program, Daley, who was himself a marginalized child, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest of his peers during his childhood, because "society did not accept socially that you liked boys and girls."
He said: "That sense of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," and he did, he said, when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent face of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he told his story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisal, and wanted to share that "hope" with others.
The three-time world champion declared that falling in love with a man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, was also a surprise for her.
Daley married last year to an Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, though he noted that the age difference had never been an issue.
When you live so much from such a young age (she was at her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone your age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "global perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all the answers would have been about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
But there are more important things than gold Olympic medals.
My gold medal from the Olympics is, without a doubt, Robbie."
His son is named Robert, after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and in fact one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I was not able to tell him that I would not be able to be in the first row.
He had his hand on my shoulder when he stopped breathing and it was only at that precise moment that he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
I knew then that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This was also the inspiration for her first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied her during the preparation for the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad footnote.
Mickelson, who was playing in the biennial event to break his record for the 12th time, was beaten by captain Furyk in the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has been so often for the United States, the five-time major champion had to be content to cheer in some moments and, in others, to try to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what was wrong.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form for Le Golf National, where the long rough continually punishes errant shots.
And if the field is not already discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth round of the Sunday match, faces the brilliant Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four shots behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, had started in such an impressive fashion, Mickelson &apos; s match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, but he could say little more.
He understood perfectly the role he plays today, gave me a pat on the back and said he would be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably did not imagine playing two games.
We thought there would be more, but that is how it came out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of us."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass the mark of Nick Faldo for most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a long line of Ryder Cups that had never so clearly demonstrated the individual brand of one of the game &apos; s greatest players.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, although Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He described it as "fun, sarcastic, clever, likes to mock others; great to have on the team."
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as a support, and this week as well; it was fun.
It is much more than just a game.
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although he has a substantial lead in the last few days of the Ryder Cup, he can easily turn it into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 Ryder Cup at Valderrama, where a Seve Ballesteros-led American team held a five-point lead over the Danes, but in the end they only managed to tie the other team, winning 14½-13½.
"You keep reminding me that we won a great tournament at Valderrama; we also won one at Brookline and lost, we won one at Valderrama and won by a whisker, but we won one at Valderrama and lost by a whisker," Bjorn said, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead by 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
History will teach us and the world that this team is not finished.
You have to give it your all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
It is not until the points are in the score.
We have a goal to achieve, and that is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on our 12 players, but we are very aware of what is on the other side, where there are the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players had done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is emerging tomorrow is individual action and that is different.
It is great to share the good news with a partner when things are going well, but when things are not going well, you really put your golfing skills to the test.
That is the message we need to send to the players, to give their best tomorrow.
Now it is time to leave your partner behind and go and get the best out of yourself.
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be hoping his players can do better individually than as a pair, with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas the exceptions, who added three points to four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the last few major tournaments, and was part of the winning team at Brookline and then part of the losing team at Medinah.
He told us, "I remember every word," when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-major parties tomorrow, but we have to play as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the field.
I chose these boys in this order because I think they cover the whole trip," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to faulty systems and the increasing cost of the project, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report in the German newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the delivery of the ship delayed the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-missile missiles, as well as some technologies of invisibility, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures that are very small.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, allowing deployment away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the oceans) will be already out of date by the time they start service, as Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was officially decommissioned last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that a ship had been returned to a shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return were not known, but German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors: half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy &apos; s ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons is twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is now estimated at EUR 3.1 billion (USD 4.2 billion), up from the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction in the naval power of Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy was "losing ships capable of deploying."
The official said that the problem has been getting worse over time, because old ships have been decommissioned but not replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new research, carried out in a Scottish Highlands area, is attempting to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
All that is learned will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation efforts.
The National Trust for Scotland will continue to monitor common and soprano pipistrelle, as well as Daubenton &apos; s bat and brown long-eared bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special bat detectors will be placed at strategic locations on the property to monitor bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The experts will analyse the sounds recorded in the recordings to determine the frequency of the calls of the bats and the species that make them.
A report and map of the habitat will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affects their nests and habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical cabling can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Mosquitoes are not actually blind.
Unless they are nocturnal hunters, their ears are more useful than their eyes in finding their prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocation to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescue operations.
The organization has even opened Scotland &apos; s first and only bat reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland &apos; s ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
Here at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and the right habitat.
However, there is still much to be learned about bats, and the work we do here and at other properties will help us to better understand what they need to thrive."
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance work on properties, as a colony of bats can be destroyed unintentionally and 400 females and young can be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species about which we know little about their populations."
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape while his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations as "fake news," and says that people are "trying to get their name out there" at his expense.
His lawyers have been instructed to file a complaint against the German magazine Der Spiegel, where the statements were published.
At the forefront of Portugal and Juventus, he is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of having paid $375,000 to keep the incident secret, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already garnered 142 million followers just hours after the news was released, Ronaldo, 33, called the report "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," he said, looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but I can &apos; t help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," he added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they have called "an unacceptable report on privacy suspicions," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, the lawyer for the player, said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
According to reports, the alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player &apos; s room and there, Ronaldo is alleged to have sexually assaulted Mayorga, according to the documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good boy" and that he had let him down by "one per cent."
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he was taken to the police and photographed at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was "afraid of reprisals" and concerned about being "humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to annul the agreement, as she was still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged attack took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a big club in Italian football, on a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: the UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if we lost our global leadership in car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark.
He said it was "disconcerting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
Mr. Clark said, "We need an agreement."
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of a Brexit without an agreement could result in the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 per cent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production shortfalls in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the general manager of Toyota Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the automobile manufacturers are the problems that could arise in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on the &quot; just in time &quot; (JIT) method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union to be assembled into cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement, there could be a disruption at the border, which, according to the sector, could result in delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would be unable to store the equivalent of more than a day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted in such an event.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May &apos; s Chequers plan, which sets out the future relationship with the EU, was "calibrated precisely to avoid those border controls."
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will not only see us through this moment but will take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
The evidence from Toyota and many other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with the successful supply chains that we have had so far.
Toyota has not been able to say for how long it will stop production, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, ultimately, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite shop steward there, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "From my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a clear and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be delayed again, White House says
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week," the White House said Sunday, as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, connections between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus compromise the independence of Mueller, has fueled gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone he himself carried to try to get rid of the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
However, on Monday he went to the White House, where he was reported to be on the verge of resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, the press secretary for President Trump, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be another, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court."
We will decide on this as we go along and I will inform the press as I usually do.
Some journalists would dispute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the lack of press coverage was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who act grandiloquently, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are grandiloquent."
She suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The president holds more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him, he said, citing without proof: "We have compared those numbers."
The press briefings will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly the President of the United States, I think that is much better than asking me."
We have tried to do this many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press briefings with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
Indeed, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why he is so popular, where he made an uncharacteristically casual and, at times, bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish Government writes to EU workers in the NHS Scotland about their fears over Brexit
The Scottish Government has written to the staff of the EU Health Service in Scotland to express gratitude for their work and to express the country &apos; s desire for them to continue working with them post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens working in non-central government public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit continued, with the expectation of making decisions this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom Government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know that all this must be very confusing to you.
And it is for that reason that I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
The experience and skills of professionals from other EU countries and elsewhere are a valuable addition to the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without doubt, your home and we would love to continue to have you as part of our family.
Christion Abercrombie is being treated urgently after suffering a head wound.
Christion Abercrombie, a player on the Tennessee State Tigers football team, was treated for a head injury in an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday, when the Tigers lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennesseean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
Reed said, "He came in and fell over right there."
Both the trainers and the medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A staff member at the Tennessee State Hospital told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center operation.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury or damage yet" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding a total of 18 tackles for the season.
Foreigners will pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the United Kingdom.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the United Kingdom and the extra money raised will be used to house the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the land transfer tax will be imposed on those persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year for the homeless.
The additional money raised from the increase in stamp duty on foreign buyers of property in the United Kingdom will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises of providing more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in the land transfer tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivize government policy to combat street begging.
The levy, which is an additional charge on the current transfer tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, could reach up to 3 per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the United Kingdom, which is causing house prices to rise and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder.
Many of the country &apos; s wealthiest areas (especially in the capital) have become &quot; ghost towns &quot; due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large builders of keeping property prices artificially high by buying land without any intention of using it and urged Mrs. May to remove the "shocking" charges on affordable homes to solve the "shameful" housing problem in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a very attractive series of reforms for housing, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my term as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life chances of every new generation.
That means addressing the housing market, which is so badly broken.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, should be able to buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of sleeping on the streets is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become a Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the prospect of reviving the north-east club, which currently occupies third place in the League One (third division of English football), three points behind the top club.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after helping St. Mirren regain their place in the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only managed to get a B cap, he told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child and it has always been something that has made me want to go back.
This opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I can successfully manage a club."
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when moving to such established names at such a big club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, my success is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
It is not easy to achieve, but I would consider myself successful only if I could return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has been a coach for just three years, after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint in the Hearts technical department.
After helping Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and helping St. Mirren avoid relegation the following season, he was appointed manager of the club.
In fact, Ross says he has never felt more comfortable in his career than he does now at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled that "Alloa was probably a real crossroads" when he took over.
I always thought that management was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, but I was good at it, I made a living from it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to deal with a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure in my work, but I feel good in my role.
I always wanted to train and now I have done so, it is the time of my adult life when I have felt better, without a doubt."
The interview can be heard on Sportsound on Monday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the best time to have a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The heat wave of the summer has boosted profits for British pubs struggling to survive, but all the pressure has been on the chains.
Pub and bar sales rose 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell 4.8 per cent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA Consulting, which compiled the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have kept the pattern of June, when pubs increased their takings by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8 per cent fall in the restaurant sector in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve primarily alcoholic beverages had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where profits were reduced.
The pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered, although not to the same extent as restaurant operators.
It seems that people only want to go out to drink.
In bars and pubs managed, sales of drinks rose 6.6 per cent during the month, while sales of meals fell 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM Hospitality and Leisure, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of sales in the home-based market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8 per cent drop in sales compared with last year is going to be especially painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant industry and time will tell whether the cooler temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in branded openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, data is collected and analysed from 47 operational groups with combined turnover of over £900 million and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that their parents are unaware of.
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that their parents and teachers are unaware of, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted among 20 000 secondary school students, revealed a growth in the number of fake Instagram pages.
The news has heightened fears of the publication of sexual content.
20 per cent of students reported having a "main" account that they show their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) have social media accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20 000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a site that is a reference for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears of the publication of sexual content.
One in five students reported having a "main" account that they showed their parents, while having other accounts that they kept secret.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter was confronted by a teenager who was encouraging others to "rape" her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Federation.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on track and field and president Ian Beattie described the change as a great opportunity for those who want sport to benefit from her great international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish athletics community, the United Kingdom and the world at large, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from her involvement in its leadership," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, suffered a transient ischemic attack, which left him temporarily unable to walk.
He tweeted: &quot; A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was hard, but I recovered completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am now doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your messages and words of encouragement!
The announcement of the breast pump that compares mothers to cows has divided opinion on the Internet.
A breast-milk-pumping company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing mothers who breast-feed to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "world's first silent breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with a bit of ironic music that shows mothers talking about the freedom they feel with the new breast pump.
Four real women dance in a hay barn, with cows, with signs such as "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Feed them, feed them, I am feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I am feeding my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company &apos; s Facebook page, has caused a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it brings the horrors of the dairy industry to the fore.
A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after giving birth," wrote one person.
The Elvie breastpump is discreetly incorporated into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby."
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who do stay at home with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a crazy idea."
However, other people defended the announcement, including one woman who admitted that the song was "distasteful."
I think that is a great idea.
If he were still nursing, he would probably have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit over the top, but I am not going to dwell on it.
It is a "wonderful product," a woman told us.
One person commented: "It is a funny announcement aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The dairy industry is not praised or criticized in the advertisement.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreetly placed bombs in their brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump milk with a pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the breastpump, making it possible for users to move, hold their babies and even go out in public with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, co-founder and ECD of Mother, explains: &quot; The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing expressive women and lactating cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minor immigrants discreetly relocated to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied minors apprehended has increased significantly, despite the fact that monthly apprehensions at the border have remained at historically high levels.</p>

Traditionally, most of the sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal records.
Around 80 per cent of sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we are still pursuing these individuals," said Albence.
In their drive to process juveniles more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from the time of arrest, instead of 60 days, as the previous norm, according to workers at the reception centres.
Many will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before a judge in immigration matters.
Those who are not eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reports from the centres of reception and the system itself over the past few months, the longer people are held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Concerns about these issues are even more acute in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of distress among these children will be overlooked.
Furthermore, the move to the camp without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma, which many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country's war has been in its eighth year.
Foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and the matter would be dealt with accordingly.
He said, "They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally."
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any foreign illegal presence."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advice to the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "planting irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
He said that Cambodia had "sought the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns."
They are "politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a de-escalation zone in Idlib province, the last major rebel bastion, has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a major assault on Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (affiliated with Al-Qaeda), which will be "eliminated."
Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy, is expected to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee, arguing that the panel should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are surely expecting, a resignation or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!"
There are no signs of fatigue among the audience at the moment.
Since 2014, CNN and MSNBC have doubled their ratings in the peak audience to 1.05 million and 1.6 million, respectively.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime-time audience, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has surpassed the cable news ratings with 3.5 million viewers for its main nightly news programs.
“It is an odd attraction that we still do not understand,” Neal Baer, the showrunner of &quot;Designated Survivor, &quot; a dramatic series on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a Capitol attack, told us.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?
When Scovell asked him why he laughed, he replied, "Because it makes me laugh."
The entertainment industry is always in a state of chaos.
Obviously, and unlike everything else on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information overloads you when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear," the $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket of Paul Manafort ("an ostentatious piece of overkill," in the words of The Washington Post), and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Mario in the same way again.
In part, what makes "Pawn Stars" feel like a reality show is that it offers something new every night, says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," when he talks about the alternating show of Trump and his daily plot twists (whether he's fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you want to keep up.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside his house watching MSNBC and CNN at the same time.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“Remember when we were doing all those crazy things with programs and people were saying that this was the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss says.
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.

The midterm elections of the House of Representatives are the most expensive.
It is no surprise that money is flowing into the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the reorganization of a congressional district with two candidates seeking reelection to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, which was recently redesigned, is represented by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing a Republican challenger, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps significantly with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favour of the Republicans.
The new 17th district has sparked a funding war between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Democrats have a slight edge in the political experts.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed off.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization was evicted by the management team of the Organization.
The State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of mission of the United States in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for Central America and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As the internal meetings progressed, the North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials in the administration made it clear that their intention was that the conference should go ahead, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has placed on the meeting.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House in Washington, D.C., declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
These explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there is already substantial evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also looking into the possibility that Trump's campaign was working in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he is preparing to run again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and I am not suggesting that Trump's fall is inevitable, or that his European equivalents will follow suit.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the country revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans now face several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller &apos; s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good place since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his unfitness for office.
Rosenstein says that The Times explanation is not quite right.
“How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will be facing a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador &apos; s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles at the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
We got a good result, as Villarreal is a good team, said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing we could do something and ended up with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall the draw was perhaps a fair result.
We were better in the first half, but we came out fighting in the second half and we were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they did well in the previous match. But with all the support from the public, I am sure we can achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be OK.
The equipment is in good shape, the boys are having a great time and we are getting a good workout.
I hope we can move forward, leave last year behind and achieve success.
Saving for retirement is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that the survey respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people spoke about this with their families.
Around half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said that they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the steps to have that conversation, says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options can be a major factor in the cost.
Incorporating the financial advisor into the conversion process, as he may also be able to help the client find a way to pay for the conversion.
Their long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help pay for expenses or insure themselves, as long as they have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Appoint a person of trust to oversee your medical care and to ensure that your wishes are carried out in the event that you are unable to communicate.
It can also prepare a notary for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don &apos; t forget the small details: imagine your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always at hand.
“It is not just the finances that are at stake: 'What kind of doctors do we have to treat?' asks Martin.

Shots fired at man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They have shot at a man with a rifle several times as he was walking home after dark.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (BST), as a "random act."
The victim did not see his assailant.
The injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
With communications cut off, relief workers have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated following the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency covers more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is a lower-level administrative region, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west coast of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Rim of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is frequently subject to earthquakes.
The following is a summary of some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on 26 December 2004, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coast.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with almost 700 fatalities.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, however, there was no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) was hit by a series of major earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the island's northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a police report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin was held in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held without bail at $500.
He was arraigned in court on Saturday, where he was declared "absolutely innocent" when asked to make a statement, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a sentence of one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska veterans court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence complaint and being drunk in public, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Several veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son &apos; s violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communications networks have collapsed and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just to the side of the Sulawesi centre, which is located to the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media showing the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attackers in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out a bike attack on the West Side Highway bike path in lower Manhattan last October, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" eight victims and caused "serious" bodily injury, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two posts carry a possible death sentence, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, the notice of intent states.
Five of the victims were from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the South District of New York processed a death penalty case.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal death sentence in New York was carried out in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg twins were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be raised in his hospital room, police said.
He was acquitted of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma for all involved,” said Patton.
The defence team for Saipov had previously requested the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a Tory protest at the conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should "feel the heat" from euro-sceptics, while one of Theresa May &apos; s MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Nigel Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more by a group of Tories in favour of remaining in the EU joining a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers agreement on track in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and "chaos".
Leave Means Leave MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now, he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough said: "I am going to defend Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the protest, where she told reporters: "I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public at large does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: &quot; Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the crowd that the politicians would feel the heat if they betrayed the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
It is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class, he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat."
“We are going to mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of the stay marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards reading "Tories Against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a Labour MP, mocked the Tories for the security problems they had with the party during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be called a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for the presidency
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump &apos; s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday evening event in Holyoke was his 60th town hall meeting since taking office, using the town hall format.
A staff assistant asked him if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to "fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top."
One arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU football player Sims
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot and killed Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and booked into East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98m tall player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders from the Mercedes team would play a key role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of the picture in the first two laps by defending his position and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to dive into the pits and let Hamilton run in his slipstream, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes came out strongly on the next lap and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a wheel-to-wheel move that left the Ferrari driver with nowhere to go and risked losing the inside line on the next corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished seventh in the first race.
He led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
Finally, he came home in 44th place, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to regain fourth place from Raikkonen.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman in letting me go.
The team has done an exceptional job in getting a perfect pair,” said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the Christine Blasey Ford letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were "bad, repugnant and false people."
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening in the Senate these days is when you see anger, when you see bad people, disgusting people, and false people,” he said.
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say "But I didn't do it."
I did not do it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember their response... did you filter the document?
Oh, no.
I did not filter it.
Well, wait a minute.
Have we filtered it? No, we haven &apos; t filtered it, he replied, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the leak was first reported in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford &apos; s allegations, I did not leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and, therefore, I did so.”
But the president did not seem to take it well, as he commented during his Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you what: that was some really bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.
Continuing his defence of the nominee to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don &apos; t care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get the power and the control, &quot; said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made amends for their Elite League defeat on Friday night by beating Belfast Giants 5-3 at home on Saturday night.
The Giants took an early lead of two goals thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local game before Darryl Sutter restored the lead for the Giants.
François Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third defeat in a row for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast the previous night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what was a very lively opening period, Sullivan returned to the local team with a will to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to equalize the game at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night with the final play of the first period.
Local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the score with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period and to ensure victory with his team &apos; s fifth goal as the game approached its end.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
A traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake plane.
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying in the line of duty to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to batter the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, where the tower was being buffeted by strong winds.
The pilot remained firm to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He jumped from the control tower when he thought the tower was about to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australian news channel ABC.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of victims is expected to rise, as many bodies were still under the rubble and many people unaccounted for.
Tsunamis up to six metres high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: &quot; Every minute, an ambulance comes with more bodies.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
That is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
CNN reported that the United States was "ready" for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in the beginning of this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after the aircraft accident in a lagoon.
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says one man is missing, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it had been unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane came in very low.
Jaynes said, "That is extremely good."
Jaynes comments that he and other travellers were able to wade through water up to their waists to the emergency exits of the plane as it began to sink.
He said that the passengers panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that the sailors working on the pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank some 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the PNG Civil Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in PNG over the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its arguments in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The Department of Justice of the United States of America called Paul Rowlett, an expert witness in intelligence analysis, to testify for hours.
He testified before the jury about how he used the records of Quinton Tellis &apos; s mobile phone to track his movements and Jessica Chambers &apos; s movements the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data of several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone records showed that Chambers &apos; mobile phone had been in contact with Sanford &apos; s phone during the time Chambers said he was with Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if he was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck with Tellis that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before Chambers &apos; death.
The mobile phone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers &apos; s death, Tellis deleted Chambers &apos; s messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "They wiped it out of their lives."
The defence is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be decided by the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A trio of hip-hop artists want to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and social commentary.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Acts such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for allegedly texting her a racist message.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving an incorrect text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that it is racist and compare the demand to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her shock when she discovered that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband, "NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mauritius twice.
After realizing its mistake, a "disgruntled" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his former nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that he was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mauritius received a day's pay and sent it home on Uber.
Mauritius is now seeking compensation for the couple's dismissal with a view to receiving compensation of $350 per day for the six months of internal work for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
He told The Post on Friday that he wanted to show them that things were not done that way, adding that he knew it was a case of discrimination.
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice &apos; s employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they would not be able to trust him after having offended him.
My wife had sent him something he did not want to say.
She is not racist.
Joel Plasco, the husband of the woman who was attacked, told the Post, "We are not racist."
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone who has been rude, even if it was an accident?
Is your baby a boy or a girl?
“Come on!”
Comparing the demand as "extortion," Plasco said his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
Are you going to go after someone like that?
That is not a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still pending, the couple has been widely condemned on social media for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington Bear publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new survey
Bond &apos; s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the map: &quot; It was difficult to put oneself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before publication.
It is good to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC page boy before being inspired by a teddy bear to write children &apos; s books, had hoped his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his books was &quot; bittersweet &quot; after his father &apos; s death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very quiet man who did not like to boast.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if he had a child who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, though it was not really your achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although he was the creator and the author of Paddington, he always gave credit to himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
As soon as the plane landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said that her husband &quot; called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to succeed &quot;.
I received a call from Nad to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said to him: "Tashi, I love you very much, darling."
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were slowly wearing out and leaving his system.
She had died too soon and everything was fading.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not scream, cry or yell because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand my ground.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was unfolding.
He said, "Nobody knew."
I bowed my head and tears were constantly falling.
It is hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.”
Widows in mourning cards to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any place.
However, he left his job before dying, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly concerned that it could have repercussions."
Davis created the cards &quot; so that people know that there are people to go to and people to talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don &apos; t sit on it, talk about it.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been together for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
He did not say he was depressed or anything like that, he tells us.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in their attitude.
Christmas was at its lowest ebb: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they must overcome it: &quot;It leaves a void in the whole family.
He left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could really get something like what he was asking for (a limited time frame, a limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity to it,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going off the rails” in the midst of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican allies not want the FBI investigation?
Its refusal is entirely due to chronology.
Five weeks remain until the midterm elections on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans have a bad night, their efforts to elect the man they want for the Supreme Court will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President &apos; s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The numbers of North Korean defectors &quot; fall &quot; under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification South, said that 1,127 people deserted last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by traffickers, have been the key factors.
No public comments have been made by Pyongyang.
The vast majority of North Koreans who defect to the South eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting in Singapore between United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm, Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh &quot; historic &quot; and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said that the nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was a "histrionic" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
Pelosi said, "I can't help but think if a woman had acted that way, they would have called her hysterical."
Kavanaugh used his emotion to deny the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
The committee also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by "angry liberals" who were upset that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
He said, "I think he is self-destructing with those statements and the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats."
Pelosi objected when asked whether she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed to the Supreme Court and the Democrats gained a majority in the House.
Pelosi said, "I will say one thing: if he is lying to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he is not fit to be on the court he is on now."
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
This is not the time for an hysterical, impartial person to go to court and expect us to think everything is fine, Pelosi said.
And women have to pick it up.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury spilling out, and she cannot let it go without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Ms. Steinem said 45 years ago.
“I don &apos; t think that &apos; s so unusual, do you?”
He continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was talking: "Perhaps you think I am crying because I am sad."
No, I am not angry.”
And he went on doing what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are permitted as a way of venting anger in part because they are not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once finding myself in tears with an unexpressed rage. A serious older woman, a manager I had always been slightly afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
He told me, &quot; Never let them see you cry.
They have no idea that you are furious.
They think you are sad and will be glad because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business, a ship named after the affair, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea that there was no reason why she herself should not run for president.
"It was not a well-considered decision," he said to me 30 years later, laughing.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they did not need another one.
Someone once referred to us as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was already well under way, it fell behind in fund-raising, and was promised that it would not be allowed to enter the race unless it raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I get a discount?” he asked.
When she announced that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on capturing voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
"It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, &quot; What are they going to put on my tombstone?
“What is ‘lore’?”
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by imposing tariffs on China &apos; s main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest increase took place this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which will tax half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently applying tariffs of between five and ten per cent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match US attacks, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon back down.
To back down from Washington would be to concede to demands, but to publicly submit to the United States would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the United States &apos; trade war could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a sudden collapse in the economy in either country is in fact much more dangerous than has been recognized so far, Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for New American Security, said.
Syria is ready to receive refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has now lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions were improving.
The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave it because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still 6 million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had supported the insurgency.
Ryder Cup goes to Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last win in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe reclaimed the crown when the Danish team of Thomas Bjorn won 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American golfer Phil Mickelson, who had to fight most of the tournament, hit his tee shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, admitting defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari was outstanding throughout his rounds, becoming one of four players to ever shoot a 5-under-par 65 in the current format of the tournament since it began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth fell to defeat by 5 and 4 to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio García, a veteran who has won eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most victories in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
I don &apos; t usually cry, but today I can &apos; t help it.
It has been a very hard year.
I am deeply grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to regain the cup.
It was a team effort and I am very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team &apos; s victory.
Now it is the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a singles match on Sunday.
I feel an incredible sense of pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, as I have grown up watching this man play golf.
Woods lost four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is an odd statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf all weekend.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting."
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we have destroyed it.
I would like to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Their 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it is our turn to bow.
They have surpassed us.”
Red tide update: Red tide concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FFWC) shows a general decrease in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, irregular bloom conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a reduction in concentrations.
The red tide bloom extends approximately 130 miles along the coast from Pinellas County to Lee County.
