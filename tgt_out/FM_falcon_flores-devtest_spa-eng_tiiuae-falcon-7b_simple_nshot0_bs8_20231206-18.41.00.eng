In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that is already generally accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this animal has a chestnut color on the upper part and a pale or carotene color on the lower part.
Moreover, the discovery allows us to understand better the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Given that the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called the raxis, but does have other features of the feathers (hairs and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raxis is probably the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure that presents the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but to the regulation of temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers maintain that, although it is the tail of a dinosaur juvenile, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a hatchling.
The experts' appraisals were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

Although there are reports that indicate that the official number of deaths is eight and the authorities have confirmed that about 30 people were injured, it is still unknown the official numbers.
Concentrations of cianuric acid and melamine were found in the urine samples of animals that died after eating contaminated pet food.
The researchers indicated that the two compounds react with each other to give rise to crystals that can obstruct renal function.
The specialists detected the formation of crystals in the urine of the felines, due to the incorporation of melamine and cyanuric acid.
When compared through the use of Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), it could be determined that the composition of the crystals coincides with that found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if you have noticed it or not, but most of the products coming from Central America to this country are free of taxes.
Even so, the countries of Central America imposed tariffs of eighty percent on the products that we manufacture. They treat us like that.
It seemed to me that that didn't make sense; definitely it wasn't fair.
The only thing I tell people is that you treat us the way we treat you.
A proposal of law was dictated by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who doesn't allow to sell or rent violent video games to minors.
The bill proposes that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.

It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said: "It seems that journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about the suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is in charge of the processing, indicated to the journalists that they would not make any additional comments until the indictment is read.
According to the information that leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also addressed, according to what was informed, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.

The day before yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, in the context of a series of measures that seek to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the generalized demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, at times violent, were provoked by the fact that elections are not being carried out, in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, which have caused six fires and minor burns to four people.

Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua informed that on Wednesday the investigators of the government managed to recover the flight recorders of the black box.
The wrestlers companions of Luna also rendered him homage.

Dustin Oro in Powder Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as me; even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
From 2008, among the 1400 people surveyed in advance of the federal elections of 2010, there was a growth of 8% of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once Queen Elizabeth II's term ends.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In one end of the survey is located a 29 % of people who think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, a 31 % who think that it should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle had to swim in the freestyle style and three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt on the basis of his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers to relieve the pain, because their use is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery through the use of several types of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of the scientists is to understand how planets are formed, in particular our own, given that comets crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, assumed as governor at the beginning of the year and last month he signed a law that allows people of the same sex to marry.
He characterized the rumors as "political babble and boorishness."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
Use satellite technology, in contrast with the old technology of ground-based radar, with the aim of enabling air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate data.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the dissuasive will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered the possibility that the game would be played closed doors, without the fanatics of the team.
On Thursday, Science magazine reported on a new species of bird discovered in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from the University of Princeton, in the U.S., and from the University of Uppsala, in Sweden, announced that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migratory, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can adopt all kinds of forms and be rolled up into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it could be used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical product being analyzed determines its pH level.
The atoms of hydrogen are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, an ion of hydrogen is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Stir both dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, knead them to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in his hands and his external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
In some homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, were found traces of sewer systems.
They also had sanitary facilities in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, given that the light of the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
You need a giant rocket, more than 100 feet tall, to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most relevant thing it has done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster way to travel.
Thanks to her today we have many means of transport, like the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and antelope.
Finally, there are many small felids (which include domestic cats) that feed on species in much greater abundance, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of his success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which avoids that it competes with others.
Lions are the big cats that socialize the most and their life takes place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their calves.
In general, the females relate closely to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behavior as wolves or dogs, with whom they share a surprising similarity (unlike the other great cats) both in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The integral athlete has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, dive, jump and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a fully sonorous roar like that of the lion, but rather like a sentence spoken in growls and yells.
The ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. As far as possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Most of their prey will be much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) through their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey mimicking their surroundings and then attack them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they come (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they can't go back easily), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
Over time, as the growing population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will not be possible to classify them as belonging to the same species.
This process receives the name of speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and it is an ineludible and fundamental consequence of evolution.
The plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to the photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses out of plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except for other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth, in addition to another group of teeth in the palate, which is translated into the fact that anything that happened to him, had no escape.
We don't have the security, but it could have had the viperine. Its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurids and, even, it could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as large as the T. Rex was a threat to him.
Although the majority of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unusual items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails, and even a type of rodent, the lizard.
Another thing that distinguished them was that the poor and women ate sitting on a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and lying on their sides while they ate.
It is not possible that the recipes of the ancient Rome include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cacao and no Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of those celebrating the ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
In some cases, they built special towers with a pyramidal shape, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the middle of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
The Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the patio; the shops were only showrooms that faced the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited the place at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Independence original of July 4, 1776". The text appears on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that it was only compiled, the huge document of parchment (measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation has been added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out on D-Day, as well as the subsequent battles, had succeeded in liberating the north of France, the south still remained to be liberated.
His government was in the hands of the French of "Vichy", who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed the peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the operation "Dragon" was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In only two weeks, the American forces and the French Free Forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
It is possible to define a civilization as a specific culture of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, as well as civitas, which means city or city-state, and which, in addition, determines the size of the society.
States are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy, and a homogenous propagation.
The cultures of the minorities tend to disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and they are not recognized as civilisations properly so called.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to fix taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, this function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to enforce all of its laws.
He was not empowered to annul fiscal or customs laws between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed to their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the north, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan, there are about 7000 islands (the largest one is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, it is usually referred to as "Japan" as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means "beautiful island".
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, gave rise to a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labour to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal region of northern Taiwan and western Taiwan in 1683 and declared this region as a dependent province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained its control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu counts with three main constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex in order for tourists to be able to see how they looked originally.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu had been restored and the works continue today.
As an example, the most common photographic image format at the global level is 35 mm, which was the size of film most commonly used towards the end of the era of film photography.
Today it is still being produced, but the most important thing is that their dimensional relationship has been transferred to the image sensors of digital cameras.
In truth, the format of 35 mm is something confusing, since its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relation of this format (dividing by twelve in order to calculate the simplest ratio of integers) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (verbigracia, the group of formats APS) are similar or are very similar to this relation of aspect.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant mockery and ridicule, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing for a certain order to be given to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected all, from the monarch to the people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church should be used for that specific purpose.
The central cupola of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, such a measure violated generally recognized international law and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting at risk, even, neutral ships.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany thought it would find a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid that situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
Arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out between many nobles who disputed the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the period of the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, since, in place of basing the charges of the army on classes, now they are based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the working class who rebelled against their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave which came to be known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which endured in time, illustrates in a very real way the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
In the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, and lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains in the surroundings. From the interior of this cave, one can see and hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, raised by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramids of great size and shape built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and small temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The mark of "upward arrow" is similar to a V and the mark of "downward arrow" is similar to a grapheme or a square without its lower border.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, whereas a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on string instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife, Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threw threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
In a certain moment, a participant of the revolt shook the head of an executed guard in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the expenses of the imperialism of E.E. U.U. in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. with the purpose of paying the greater part of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From now on, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will be the main source of profits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events take place is known as the Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300 (that is, between the years 1000 and 1300 d. C.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The technological determinism is a concept that comprehends, pragmatically, a great abanico of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative until a strict sense of that there is a subyacente logic that impels the destiny of the humanity and that it relates with the laws of the science and how they are reflected in the technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on its own independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not viable economically for a reduced number of cars, with the result that new techniques of manufacture are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded people and, with the passage of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered as such in the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began approximately in 400 BC and extended until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its status decayed, especially due to the fact that, on their return, the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the dress received great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
Nevertheless, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the western styles could take a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Agriculture of subsistence is that whose objective is to produce enough food to feed exclusively the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds from the ecological region with the rotation of crops or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of the farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many countries in the process of development.
The subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by the social standards and gives them the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of its members.
The traits that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is frequent that the members of a subculture exhibit traits of their belonging to this resorting to the distinctive and symbolic use of the style, as the fashions, the gestures and the lexis.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for graphing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, bad luck or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost equal to those of the specific animal that took care of it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Although the learning based on projects should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, the scaffolding goes a little further.
The andamiaje is not a learning technique; it is, on the contrary, an assistance that provides support to those who go through a new experience, such as the use of a new software or the beginning of a new project.
The andamiaje can present itself both in real and virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of andamiaje, but also it is the small animated subject of Microsoft Office.
The andamiajes virtuales are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to understand on their own.
Children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment without love, care and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our foster care system is to offer safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The objective of foster care is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home of origin.
The Internet is a mixture of components of mass communication and between people.
The different traits that characterize the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, apprenticeship and socialization are significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of the users to the websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), it was also detected the "participation personal" and the "durable relationships" as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, there have been important findings in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that, through the proper reading of its microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained the way in which those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of the speaker.
Even suggests that the skills to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between one and the next generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources available to it.
It is more, not doing it entails serious problems: deceleration of growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have constituted the simplest source of vegetable resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except if they are cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
The interruption of sleep consists in waking up intentionally during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep again after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a more or less soft alarm clock that makes him return to a conscious state, although without waking him completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm consist of drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige him to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we count. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
All of us can attain enlightenment. The only thing that obstructs the path is our tension and negativity.
Although the bases of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread through the path of love Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be unblocked, the chakras can be activated and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up by distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and it would be fought for real, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that for the 17th of September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize itself in the extension of the Romanian head of bridge.
Despite this, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since time immemorial, the function of the navy has been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The campaign of the North Atlantic in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transfer men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this circulation.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Great Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were domesticated, for the first time, about 10 000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the purpose of obtaining easily their milk, hair, meat and skin, the ancient peoples and tribes started to keep them.
Generally, domestic goats were gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasturage, often tended by herdsmen who were children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
In England, the railways had already been installed in the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carriages were made of simple parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and to carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to maintain the rails in their place took place quite early. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
It has become a common practice, although the iron caused a greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron ones and, in 1767, they began to use iron rails.
The first form of transport that was known was walking. The human being began to do it in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Our predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking erect.
Although traces of bipedalism have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, form part of environmentalist movements or, even, we can become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, the suffering of the future.
It is, in many cases, like the asymptomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is manifest that the world has suffered great changes, product of the technological and scientific advances of the human race, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and the extravagant life style of the people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, 1776, a handwritten copy was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, who lived only a few blocks away.
Copies were made, during the night, between 150 and 200, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time and did so in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On the 6th of July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on the 9th of July. On the 10th of August, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are birds.
Many people don't represent them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs, and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work based on the manipulation of data coded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, such as, for example, vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be finding an open bottle of medicine or cleaning chemicals.
Read the label for information specific to first aid for that specific poison.
The entomologists use the term "parasitic insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with chinches, a species very developed to parasitize humans.
Cockroaches that kill and bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. is estimated to be around 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the union of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women have twice as many chances as men of suffering from EM.
A couple could come to the conclusion that raising a child would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way in which the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific investigations.
However, it is not an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide the scientific investigation.
The focus of naturalists as well as of philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the Bible.
The thoughts of Aristotle, especially the questions of science, even psychology, were accepted.
As the domain of the Greek language was declining, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
In many cases, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in the behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to external regular stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining manner and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA consisted of a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using fagos, or viruses.
They carried out two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fungus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected DNA fragment, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks, and study of information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs, and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place from which they just came.
In this dynamic transfer vehicle, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists support that this massive economy of carbon has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of the society and uses the transport systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason that transportation systems give rise to so many complaints and why do they fail so often? Are the engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of the drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows the traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be approximated by a mathematical representation.
With the aim of graphically clarifying the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Dichas relaciones facilitan tanto el planeamiento y el diseño como las operaciones de los dispositivos viales.
The first species to fly were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This provides a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the Anisoptera and the Ephemeroptera are the only insects that are unable to fold their wings.
Millennia ago, a man called Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, correct?
The Amazon River is the most caudalous and the second most extensive river in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total amount of water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they were never able to surpass the size or the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian city of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated from more than a thousand years ago.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The Italian language is used in the Vatican City, both for drafting its legislative texts and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that is spoken daily by the majority of those who work within the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The total number of citizens who live in the Vatican adheres to the Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Ello guardaba mayor similitud con los estados de la materia (con idéntico orden): sólido, líquido, gaseoso y plasma, solo que, al mismo tiempo, tenía la teoría de que se transforman en nuevas sustancias que conforman las cosas que vemos.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be the elements such as calcium and potassium. From now on, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metals.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Therefore, when it was invented, the pencil gained many friends.
Unfortunately, due to the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't even have the need to, even, approach a pencil.
The only thing left to ask is what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works according to the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when rolling a heavy cart up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to decompose with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km in the near side and about 100 km in the far side.
She is thinner under the moons and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more mares in the nearby side due to its thinner crust, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines maintain that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up until they reached maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
To managers in this category it is difficult to take decisions that are unpopular with employees, to impose disciplinary measures, to carry out performance evaluations, to assign responsibilities and to demand accountability from the staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it necessary to modify everything that has been done until now and do it in its own way.
In the end, the ultimate success or failure of the team is the responsibility of the leader.
This way of behaving many times ends up distancing the leaders from the rest of the team members.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Often, the members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
Generally, they enjoy more autonomy than the members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones, which, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of the virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that fixes the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organization to submit to the process of establishing an organization for learning? One of the purposes of applying the concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
The product of this, it is possible that the process of an organization that works in team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process in order to attend the needs of the customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, the leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to the research of cognition. They reduce the field of research and give it greater accuracy.
The correlation existing between the cerebral pathology and the behavior contributes to the research of the scientists.
For a long time, it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the apogee of new technologies, we have the possibility to see and investigate the structures and processes that take place in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a speciality of great relevance within computer science, which is responsible for the behaviour, learning and adaptive intelligence in a machine.
The research in the field of AI implies the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and consultation requests from customers, as well as facial recognition, handwriting, and voice recognition.
These questions have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The system of Artificial Intelligence is now often used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering and military, in the same way as it was incorporated in various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual excursions. The students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of the Bennet High School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the page is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as an album of memories.
Blogs can also contribute to improve the writing of students. Even though students usually start their blogging experience with a poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes in front of an audience.
Due to the fact that students tend to be the readers who most criticize, the writer of blogs begins to make an effort to improve his writing, in order to avoid the criticisms.
In addition, blogging "demands that students be more understanding of the world around them." The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics.
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more to the south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting it from Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All these aspects, among others, are those that highlight Ontario as intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas towards the north are little populated and some of them are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that causes great surprise to many: in the United States there are more African Americans than Canadians.
The location of the islands of Eastern Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wild life.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
The Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and it was imposed, in good measure, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial influence of Europe and colonialism took place in the 15th century, as a result of the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region limits with the Sahel to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Rotunda should reject men and not fear defending her position (cultural differences or not, that's not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 1st century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians, who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was reconstructed by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who installed their businesses in that place called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan articles, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of knick-knacks, although everything is prepared for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist point of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at the eastern border, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the volcano Nyiragongo destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the center of the city.
Although Goma is quite safe, any visit to the outside must be considered in order to take knowledge of the situation of the confrontations that persist in the province of Kivu in the North.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking excursions are some of the most economical in Africa.
To transfer within Goma, one can opt for taking a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
As well as being relatively inaccessible, it has given "Tombuctú" an image of an exotic and distant land.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecozones, in each of which a different wild life develops.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all the natural reserves of South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island homonymous, which is the destination of most tourists consider the main attraction.
It has been compared the deployment of buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong with a luminous bar chart that is evident by the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and go to the Kowloon side, located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is most dense.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see proof of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest within the Indian territory is known as Sundarbans National Park.
In spite of this, the forests are not only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3,850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of the wild life and it is estimated that in the current area there are about 400 tigers of Bengal and about 30 000 spotted deer.
The buses depart from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) all day, although the majority, especially those that travel to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are usually full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance.
Most of the districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge of the river Oyapock is a cantilever bridge that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m of width.
Under the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August of 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March of 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that currently constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the guaraníes, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá groups lived in the region, for example, who hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spaniards gave the start to the stage of colonization, which extended for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established, in 1537, Paraguay has been able to conserve a good part of its aboriginal idiosyncrasy and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important polo tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also watch other tournaments and lower level games in other parts of the year.
On the site of the Argentine Association of Polo you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the games.
The value of the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there. It's in front of the FIC West store, in Stanley.
They usually accept pounds sterling in any place within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There are chances that in the islands of the periphery they do not accept credit cards, but they could use British or American money. Ask in advance with the owners to be able to define which method of payment is accepted.
