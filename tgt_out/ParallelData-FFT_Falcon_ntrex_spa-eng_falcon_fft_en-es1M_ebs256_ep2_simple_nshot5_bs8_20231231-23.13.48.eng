The Members of the Welsh Assembly (AMs) are concerned about appearing "Muppets" (Muppet is a term used in the United Kingdom to describe a person who is regarded as foolish or gullible).
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for short).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the House from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Member of Parliament said that his group was concerned that it would "rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: twp means &quot; stupid &quot; and pwp means &quot; shit &quot;.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that the whole of his group was "disappointed" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the leap from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
The 2017 Act of the Welsh Government gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed widespread support for calling the Welsh Parliament to Westminster.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission had preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the option MWP had received the most support in a public consultation.
The M.P.s are reportedly suggesting alternatives, but the fight for consensus could leave the Assembly President, Elin Jones, floundering, with the bill to change the law due to be sent to the Assembly in a few weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes relating to the operation of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
The Members of the Assembly will have the final say in the question of how they should be called when they deliberate on legislation.
The Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the change of name of the country.
Voters will decide on Sunday whether the name of their country will change to "Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent for the difficulties of Harlem churches
“Historically, the older people I have spoken to say that there was a pub and a church on every corner,” comments Mr. Adams.
Today, there is neither one nor the other.
He noted that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
People now socialise in other ways, he says.
“The pubs are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods that people go to regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders hope and that "they will eventually return to the starting point."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the type of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, and therefore they will accelerate the closing of these churches, because it is unlikely that the vast majority of people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped there acquired the building.
A black congregation took over the reins of St. Martin, under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, and while the congregation of Father Johnson planned for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of the Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called them "the poor man's campaigns."
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it a "cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument."
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first tenor horn ever used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to play the larger Riverside Church tenor horn 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martín did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Maarten in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "attempt[ed] to pass the costs" to the parish board, even though the board had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old boy mauled by shark while diving for lobster off California
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for abalone in California on the first day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about 30 minutes on Saturday morning when they heard the boy calling for help, so they came over to help him.
Hammel commented that he initially thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then realized that he was &quot; screaming that he had been bitten &quot;.
Hammel noted that the boy &apos; s collarbone was broken.
Hammel added, "I shouted to all of them to get out of the water because there was a shark."
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children &apos; s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to boost the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff in their beauty and style aisles.
In order to significantly boost the UK's £28 billion beauty market, which is growing at a rate faster than the decline in fashion and homeware sales, the largest beauty halls will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space on shelves that used to be taken up by televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other stores, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second of which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift towards daily small-quantity shopping at local stores force supermarkets to work harder to get people to visit.
Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe has said that the stores will increasingly resemble shopping centres as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount rivals Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount stores into hundreds of outlets and introduced several Habitat stores since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is believed that this has boosted sales of food and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over how to split the revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical products in Sainsbury's supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of 281 Sainsbury &apos; s pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is said to be participating in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin-care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a dedicated team of staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to suit all needs, and our attractive environment and convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, was "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the fashion and accessories business.
This business had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his new extraordinary deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the gold girl of television admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for her Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the head office of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow and was being touted as a favourite to double Willoughby's fortune, at around £11 million.
While Willoughby, aged 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "It was truly Holly's main priority.
It was to be her long-term future, which would keep her in the picture for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved completely stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly delay its launch further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby launched Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, who is 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on holiday together and Jones has a 40 % stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become the face of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that "no business was discussed" last night.
A difficult conversation &quot; and then we fell in love &quot;
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his mock-newsman voice.
“I have not given up anything.
He said that Kim is interested in meeting again with him after Trump praised the first meeting held in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea &apos; s denuclearization.
However, the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an "appropriate response" from the US to North Korea's first steps towards disarmament.
On the contrary, the EU, he said, continued to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump &apos; s vision was much more optimistic in his speech.
He said, "We get along great with North Korea."
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: the end of missile tests, help in freeing hostages and bringing the remains of American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach to speaking about his relationship with Kim.
It is very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we would have 200 people right here, &quot; Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, which makes things a little more complicated,” explains Mrs Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international aid agencies would be allowed to help.
Given that the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even if there was a prior warning, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Traveling from one island of Indonesia to another is a challenge at best.
Natural disasters further complicate the logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia &apos; s worn-out infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has allocated quite a bit of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who is facing a re-election next year.
It must also contend with the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people died and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other crude weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, equals the Chelsea score
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot and struck it with a kick.
The action sent it over the top of the area and towards the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap, and fell into the net.
Sturridge said: "I was trying to get into that position to get on the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible."
I saw Kante coming and gave him a tap. I didn &apos; t think about it too much, I just fired.
Chelsea was winning 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues &apos; media player, Mateo Kovacic, made a step-over pass to Mateo Kovacic before turning and playing a ball into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle.
After that, he made a nice trip to space, which brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished by kicking the ball into the net with his left foot after a clearance by Becker, of Liverpool, who could not stop it.
The match will be played on Wednesday, 15:00, at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, and will be broadcast live on TV.
For their part, Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the country &apos; s emergency agency early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday, unleashing waves as high as six metres, according to the agency &apos; s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press briefing.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man is arrested by police as a suspect in the murder of a woman who was stabbed to death.
An investigation into murder has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7.55 a.m. on Saturday in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
In addition, I would recommend to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found on the inside of a property.
Some people who claim to know the woman arrived at the crime scene this afternoon to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim &apos; s family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that nobody can get in or out of the building.
He was left perplexed when he discovered what had happened.
Now, the residents are told that they will be allowed back in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent telling a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was seen crying at the site.
He keeps repeating "it is terrible."
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several officers stood guard inside the cordon, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send an e-mail to DM @MerPolCC, call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or report information online at.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament Square becomes the latest memorial to "rewrite history"
Its banning would be poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England by its puritanical fanatical followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestions of Mr Crick as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure from the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent portrait by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a testament to the opinion of the nineteenth century and to part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: 'Many people consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than now, a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, the monarchy.
If it is a totally accurate description, then it is a matter for further historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a livestock dealer at a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pen in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He apparently travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that there was a great pig in the sty with blood on its mouth.
The post-mortem examination confirmed that the pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
The legs of my cousin were bloodied and torn, &quot; Wu &quot;, the cousin, told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It appears that the family of Yuan and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, it is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms had cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it off.
After pigs ate a livestock farmer in Oregon in 2012, a livestock farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "dispenser."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What is needed is the appropriate respect for them,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the south-west of the United States.
As planned, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains over much of northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa produced winds of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday morning (Eastern time) to 5 a.m. Monday, and was located about 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressure is starting to develop in the Pacific Ocean, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the heavy tropical rains northward, towards the south-west United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical rain meets the low-pressure system moving in, widespread heavy rain will occur in the south-west over the next few days.
Locally, 2 to 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible desert slides.
Heavy tropical rains will cause rainfall rates of 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 10 cm is expected in parts of the south-west, especially in most of Arizona.
Because of the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall, flash floods may occur suddenly with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
For this threat of tropical storm rainfall, it is strongly advised against to walk in the desert.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms could cause localized winds and dust storms.
The approaching low pressure will bring heavy rain to specific parts of the southern California coast.
Heavy rains may leave as much as two inches of water, which could cause small flows of debris and slick roads.
The first heavy rains of the wet season would have been falling.
Some scattered tropical storms will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rain becomes widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will continue through the Four Corners on Tuesday and into Wednesday.
Intense temperature changes can be observed in the United States in October, as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
Sometimes, this means drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the whole of the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and, Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, an early October warm-up is expected, with temperatures generally in the mid-20s from the South to parts of the north-east.
On Tuesday, New York could see temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above average.
Our long-range forecast indicates high probabilities of above-normal temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony.
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, and the media interrupted their regular programming to report the latest news on Friday: an agreement designed by the Arizona senator, Jeff Blake, for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the allegations for a week.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had groped her while she was drunk and that he had tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his impassioned testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely certain that that had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who watched Nielsen on Friday probably saw it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other channels that carried the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has some problems in estimating how many people are watching a particular programme in a particular office.
To put it in perspective, it is a viewership similar to that of a playoff game in American football or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have strongly supported Kavanaugh, led the pack, with an average of 5.69 million viewers for a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC occupied the second place, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen commented.
After the trial, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the cameras of CNN and CBS caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday morning.
While receiving these reproaches, which were broadcast live by CNN, he appeared crestfallen.
One woman said to me, "Looking me in the face."
“Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?”
He continued: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and broadcast television aired everything live hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to nominate Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the following week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The decision by Flake was critical, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The first British prime minister, May, accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
Theresa May, the prime minister, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the first female British prime minister, arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his, on the newspaper's front page, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the alleged Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge each other for tariffs was "completely absurd."
Wayde murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player &apos; s death
A suspect has been arrested in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The glasses were recovered at the crime scene and reportedly found to contain Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say that he admitted shooting Wayde.
A bail bond of USD 350,000 has been set, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner &apos; s Office released a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head that had entered the skull.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police crime laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the police in the area for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who measured over 2 metres, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game during the last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that his team was "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
Wade commented, "That's what people worry about."
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico City.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre registered several tremors and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after anti-riot police clashed with pro-independence demonstrators as thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the polarised Catalan independence referendum.
A group of hooded separatists who had been stopped by the riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
Fights also broke out later and the police used truncheons to quell the fighting.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans such as "Neither forgiveness nor forgetting," clashed with unionist demonstrators, who chanted "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the 1 October vote, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrated.
The voters chose by an overwhelming majority for independence, although the turnout was low, as those who were against the secession boycotted the referendum to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at polling stations throughout the region, where violent clashes took place.
The pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, a retired electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost all hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year was one of our best years.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he commented.
Despite a narrow victory in the regional elections in December, the pro-Catalan parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, await trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
He said, "It is getting more and more tense."
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be standing in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for driving a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday evening at 7.30 p.m. on Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that the damage was done to the access and the building itself.
At some point, the car may have been shot with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Livingston secured victory with the first goal scored by Dolly Menga
A Livingston promoted to impress the Rangers, managed to get the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
The attack of Dolly Menga marked the difference. The Gary Holt went up one place, with the Hibernian in second.
This season, Gerrard have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face leaders Hearts, who have an eight-point lead.
Before that, Rapid Viena is played against Rangers on a Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his winning streak to six games in the division, while Holt, the head coach, has not tasted defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lets a visitor with a punch go by
The Holt team had to have gone one step ahead much earlier than they did, causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers by their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence, but missed his shot from in front of the goal. Alan Lithgow then missed the target after a Craig Halkett shot had been deflected into the goal.
The home team would let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the visitors with their long-ball tactics.
Thus was the decisive blow struck.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston looked for an opening, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At the time, Rangers were in control of the game, but they were unable to break down the home defence and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was fairly untroubled.
This game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stoppage.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, blocked a shot from Scott Pittman with a kick, and Lithgow missed a Livingston pass.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly being awarded, but were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one for a Halkett challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a hand.
Livingston &apos; s &quot; Phenomenal &quot; (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent play that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His style of play and his squad have hardly changed since his appointment, but this is largely due to the way in which he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was a giant and led a magnificently organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some very good moments with Gerrard, they came up short.
They failed to materialize the plays, managing to get into the opposition's half of the field only once, which is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
Smiles and a blue sky were on show for the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin on Saturday 29 September.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have debated issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police cited security concerns to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also spoke out against both his policies and the German government &apos; s decision to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, who was received as a hero by some German Turks and as an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a car
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, heading south-east towards the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended to by paramedics, but he died there and then.
The accident occurred after another cyclist was killed after being hit by a car that fled the scene on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been blocked and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured after disturbances
Six prison officers have been injured in a brawl at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authority.
The disturbances began at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 9.30 a.m. on Sunday and are still continuing.
A team of elite specialists (known as "Tornado") is in charge of controlling the disturbances, which involve eight inmates and are taking place in one wing.
The agents received assistance for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service commented: "We have deployed specialist prison staff to deal with the current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical care after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, prison officers were called in to deal with a serious disturbance in which inmates attacked prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (the arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the Southwest desert, with the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern Nevada and eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind as she goes.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix commented in a tweet that only 10 hurricanes had maintained their status as a tropical storm or depression within 321 kilometres of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.”
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of torrential rain, with up to 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
They are likely to fall between 2 and 5 inches, with the possibility of 10 inches in isolated areas, in other parts of the Southwest Desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of flash floods, Rosa &apos; s rains are considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, part of these torrential rains is likely to be beneficial because of the current drought conditions in the south-west.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which by Sunday morning will still have a hurricane-force wind with maximum gusts of 136 kilometres per hour, is 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moving north at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to hit Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm by late Monday afternoon.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at significant risk of flooding.
“Heavy rains of 7 to 15 centimetres are expected from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimetres,” as reported on weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward across northern Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then move across Arizona and southern Utah as a tropical storm late Tuesday night.
The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, north-west Sonora and south-west of the United States desert.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, at about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable."
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to the Somerset Police.
The police have appealed for anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh &quot; suffered the meanness and anger &quot; of the Democratic Party.
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and desperate tactics of the Democrat Party,” said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Senate on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford &apos; s allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this allegation.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, "Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a jurist with an admirable record of public service,” he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's nomination when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks to go to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not running, but I am in the race, &quot; he said.
“That is why I go from one place to another, fighting for great candidates.
Trump alleged that the Democrats are embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
A senior Republican Party official told CNN on Friday that the first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people killed in a quake and tsunami in Indonesia, the toll rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that were ravaging the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres hit the coast in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When a tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, &quot; so they were victims &quot;, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, for its Indonesian acronym), at a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, everything on land, said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, bridges broken and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city was still being hit by the shells on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which is built on the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, and 540 persons were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralysed and there was no information" from Donggala, commented Nugroho.
The Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people lived there, and that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the agency &apos; s officials said that the waves had already reached the coast by the time the alert was issued.
In a recording made by an amateur and shared on social media, a man can be heard warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in the surrounding areas of Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city &apos; s airport has reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centres in Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
It is a very bad thing.
Although the World Vision staff in Donggala have arrived safely in Palu, where the employees are sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating scene on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
He said, "I was told that many houses had been destroyed."
It is a very bad thing.
Even as the aid machinery was being put in place, some people were complaining that experienced aid workers were not being allowed into Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign funding, supplies and personnel may be used if the site is declared a national disaster area.
And that has not yet happened.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the Government says that it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but it has not happened yet."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of the people still missing still had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolate stories that natural disasters write.
A small child was pulled from a drain on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the instructor of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Other students of his were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
"For my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional baggage," he commented.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed into the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a grey checkmark, not two blue checkmarks.
He said, "I think that means that the messages were not delivered."
Thieves made off with $26,750 during a cash-out at an ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a Brink employee was robbed at gunpoint while refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, and $26,750 was taken, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied an automatic teller machine at the entertainment centre and was preparing to reload it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running up behind the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money intended for recharging.
According to the note, there were witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will start to be known as Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time now, a name he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the creator of the program commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
“I think it is the most used word in the Bible, which means 'you',” West commented earlier this year while talking about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
The phrase &quot; I am you, you are me, we are all together &quot; means &quot; I am you, you are me, we are all together &quot;.
He went from being Kanye, which means 'the only one', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without guion.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected President of Mexico, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the student movements of the left were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly stipends to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I. A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in this field, argues Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments arose after the announcements by various parts of the United States Government, including when, in general, the United States has no formal I. A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I. A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging far behind the United States. We are looking to the next step in I. A. research,” comments Lee.
Double the funding means double the chances of the next great achievement in I. A. being made in the U.S., as Lee declared in an interview with CNBC this week.
Read, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important I. A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a chess-playing system that beat the best American player of Othello. Subsequently, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
He gave credit to the previous technological competitions of the United States Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, commented Lee.
“It is not China that is taking the lead from the academics; it is the corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent academics to work on I. A.
Lee commented that changes in US immigration policy could also help to intensify US efforts in Iraq.
"I think that I. A. doctors should automatically be given permanent residence cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, commented Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to attract partners from industry and academia, while the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than 100 million USD per year in I. A. research.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation that attempted to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change the name of their country.
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday to change their name to "Republic of Macedonia North," a move that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the new name, but nationalist opponents maintain that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Slav majority in Macedonia.
The President, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50 % required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
“I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, to enable them to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, aged 79, in Skopie.
Although not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared that, at one o'clock in the afternoon, no irregularities had been reported.
However, the turnout was only 16 %, compared to 34 % in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, said he had come to vote for his children, &quot; our place is in Europe &quot;.
Zoran Zaev, the prime minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum of Macedonia on a change of name of the country that would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents of those who were going to boycott the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
The Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, with an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
I believe that the great majority will be in favour, as more than 80 % of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said that a positive result would be "a confirmation of our future."
A poll published on Monday by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggested that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum, which would be lower than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV, in Macedonia, revealed that 57 per cent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, evades the whole Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling scored the winner as Manchester City beat Brighton 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian media were given a pass to the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defences before breaking into open country.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded one defender before outrunning several more in the Brighton area.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who was hit by the right foot of Mathew Ryan to prevent a shot that went to the right of the goal.
City manager Pep Guardiola commented: "Agüero has got a few problems with his foot."
We spoke of playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That was what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton goal.
He made a nice pass to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before directing Sterling towards the second post.
The Sky blues forward hit the ball just before it went out of play.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies &apos; party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff picture, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies at least secured a wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still chasing their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can kick the ball around with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be energized and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I have faced this year.
Why wouldn &apos; t you want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce a Sunday starter, but it looks as if they are inclined to leave Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th appearance, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The record of the Washington wizard is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation, his nomination to the Supreme Court, when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
In November, everything we have done is at stake.
There are five weeks to go to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is one of the most important. I do not stand, but I do run around, and I fight for great candidates, &quot; he said.
He continued: "We have this terrible radical group of democrats, they are now in the process of doing this.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and you can see the meanness, the evil.
They do not care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control. And we are not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, were embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
“We have seen it these last four days,” he said, “the Democrats were furious, they were bad, they were horrible and they were false.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his reply?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I hope for a response. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.
The Labour Party now encompasses a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs to be told that I am not welcome, just for saying what I think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment for being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He was at odds with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe. It is ironic that it was on matters on which Jeremy was at odds with previous leaders.
As the Labour Party East Nottingham East branch notice of its meeting on Friday stated, "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For the greater part of the eight years that I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more compassionate and caring" policy is long forgotten, if it ever was implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether or not the party leadership consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to change his mind radically and to adopt positions with which he had never been comfortable, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of abuse on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced this.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, for the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist abuse, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that broad range of opinions and, with every "gag" motion or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice to keep my head down and not make too much noise and that I would be all right.
But I have not entered politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher Government which left my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, nor have I done so in the recent elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who promoted the Friday motion is that I do not understand these people wasting time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is going headlong to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not to Notts Momentum, but to the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal and no opportunism will stop me from acting in what I believe to be best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an Ayr unbeaten rises to the top
Two late goals may have decided the final outcome, but, without doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this long-drawn-out Tennent's Premiership match.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the 10.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make the most of opportunities, that gave the local team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
“We have been tested in all quarters and we have come through, so I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, commented: "Ayr deserves the recognition, they took the opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute effort, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, on loan to the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opposition and Jason Baggot scored a penalty that was not converted.
The Ayr extended its lead with a penalty kick just before half-time, and then scored again to make the score 17-5.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson &apos; s essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this lead to five points.
There was a long delay after a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be stretchered off, and, when the game resumed, Ayr took the lead with a Stafford McDowall try converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the fact that they had one more man with an unfulfilled Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the premises were recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson to please Climo without the ball, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
The weather, as it had done almost since the game restarted, after Kyle Rowe had received the ball from David Armstrong on a kick and sent Gregor Henry flying into the back of the net for the fifth time, converted the game.
Still Game star wants to take his career in a new direction
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be determined to move into the catering business after being named as the new head of a restaurant chain.
The actor is Jack Jarvis, 56, who is best known for his role in the BBC comedy series, which he writes and co-stars in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming restaurant trade" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors are stationed at a naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue-and-white flags fly from public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the motto: &quot; The sea is ours by right,
The duty to recover it is a duty.
In Bolivia, a land without sea, the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict for the resources that took place in the nineteenth century, in addition to the desire to return to sail the Pacific Ocean, is still vividly remembered.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and calm and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision, &quot; commented Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favour of Bolivia &apos; s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is embroiled in a controversial re-election battle next year, also has much to say about the resolution on Monday.
In late August, he promised that we are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favour and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling came only six months after the final arguments indicate that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
Moreover, he suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak to each other at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court was unusually swift in its decision-making.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 years of mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political football.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The resolution is an opportunity to see what we need to leave behind.
North Korea says that there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honour the pledges made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear talks with North Korea, which have been stalled for more than three months since this summit with Kim Jong U.
He points out that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that would end the Korean War and bring the North under the South is a 'pipe dream'.
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration without some meaningful disarmament movement from Pyongyang.
Kim and the US president, Donald Trump, want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang &apos; s renunciation of an arsenal that the country probably regards as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of enormous hats about to land in a street of shops near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a collection of eccentric large-size hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hat has flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the runway.
Valentino &apos; s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim decorated with feathers that enveloped the heads of the models.
Other large-scale additions have included a diamond-encrusted watermelon, a wizard &apos; s hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of outlandish masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-up lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation looked like a full scuba team, complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like the look of big clothes, you're in luck.
The big hat crowd predict that the big hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
The big hats are all the rage thanks to "La Bomba", with a 60 centimetre wide hat with a wing used by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of this impractical hat, which flooded social media, presented another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the model wearing it.
The orange-brown raffia bag, decorated with white raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As Luke Armitage, the stylist to the stars, told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on the streets. As the designer has had such a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories."
John Edward: language skills are vital for citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in examinations, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for short), strive to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they will occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a curriculum, modern languages are observed to remain popular and sought after in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message will get to his head.
If you speak to them in their language, you reach their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we look at the recent results of this year &apos; s examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables, with the pass rates at independent schools being the highest.
Overall, 68 per cent of pupils studying foreign languages achieved an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centres that make up the SCIS, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that will be needed by children and young people in the future without a doubt.
Today, languages are considered to be on the same level as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere else.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of the reasons given by employers for difficulties in filling jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable for preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential for employment requiring language skills is increasing, making these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career path someone chooses, if he or she has learned a second language, he or she will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a skill like this, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people in foreign countries will automatically put that person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and it was also established that the only language spoken by a two-figure percentage, 15 per cent, was French.
For this reason, investing in language learning is important for today &apos; s children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, they will be equipped to have better opportunities for quality employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in different schools.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the more important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child &apos; s interests, independent schools will always offer a choice of languages taught by specialist staff.
Independent schools in Scotland focus all their efforts on providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered "competences for international communication."
The independent sector will continue to offer these choices, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It is only fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Colleges Council
LeBron James debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans to see LeBron James make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the season-opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be seen how long he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton commented on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers &apos; six-game pre-season schedule.
In this stage of my career, I do not need pre-season parties to prepare myself.
Time of Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week by Mr. Trump, including stops at locations with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy in the offing, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are counted in November.
What time is Trump &apos; s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch it online through a live YouTube broadcast.
It is likely that Trump will comment on the Kavanaugh hearings this week, which were strained by allegations of sexual misconduct and have left a Senate confirmation vote in limbo for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main aim of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans who are facing the November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, the president &apos; s campaign said that the five rallies next week are intended to &quot; rally volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives &quot;, according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the campaign, &quot; said a Trump campaign spokesman who would not give his name to Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage from Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday visit will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has to come and give him a push in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows that it is prepared to fight to keep the hope of individual matches alive on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, more so in competitions like this.
Then, where would they say the impulse is now?
They were six points ahead and now they are four, so I guess that is a little momentum, said Jordan Spieth after the round.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more on the line.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel they have a bit of wind behind them and plenty of reasons to be cheerful, not least the fact that Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and finished with three points each.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee to the green and preaches with the example.
The guttural cries of celebration rose in volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt for the halved match when he and Thomas were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the lead in the 15th was greeted with a similar cry, one that suggested that the US team had not yet been eliminated.
What is needed, he said, is redoubled efforts and concentration on the party.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable pair of Europa and Melpomene are four for four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only pair to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
This run and the way their energy flows with the noisy crowd on Sunday make it clear that these are the players to beat, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
It is preferable to play both at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio García, the hero of the four-ball morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they never emerged.
But on Sunday there will be no help for getting out of holes.
The fourball and foursomes are fascinating to watch because of the interplay between the couples, the advice given and not given, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team is prepared to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the final day of the Ryder Cup with a good lead after winning the fourballs and foursomes 10-6 against the United States.
The Fleetwood-Molinari duo led the contest with two wins over a Tiger Woods who struggled, gaining four points in the Le Golf National ranking.
Europe's Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many errors in the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but did not manage to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual Sunday matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership served to defeat a deflated Woods and the American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who had not been in particularly good form for the two parties on Saturday, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome matches, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned with Henrik Stenson to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world Nos. 1 and 3 respectively, 2 and 1.
Although the day was pleasant and calm in the south-west of Paris, Europe was not having all its own way.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference point for the Americans, who earned two points on Saturday.
They won a thrilling 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has come back from a four-point deficit in the singles only twice, although Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to retain it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that mounting a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that &quot; there is no possibility &quot; of unilateral disarmament if they do not have confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened his country &apos; s mistrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country &apos; s unilateral abandonment of nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
North Korea &apos; s Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the international body that it had taken &quot; important goodwill measures &quot; over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances, there is no possibility of our unilateral disarmament.
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization formula that would reward the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he did not reject outright a unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an American president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must renounce its nuclear weapons before it can be considered to have ended the war.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States has insisted on denuclearization first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose by force, even objecting to a declaration of the end of the war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our mistrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the US leader to the UN at the beginning of the week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, in the past five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri &apos; s tone was radically different from last year &apos; s speech to the UN General Assembly, when he said that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be directed towards US soil after &quot; malignant president &quot; Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim &quot; rocket man &quot;.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and that sanctions must continue to be applied until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years, five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must be vigorously and fully enforced until we realize the ultimate and fully verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions unanimously on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang &apos; s ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea denounced his "demands as those of a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantling a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took “corresponding measures.”
He said that Kim had told him that the “measures” he was seeking were the security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to sleep enough
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students are now sleeping more in an attempt to fight the growing culture of all-night cramming while drinking coffee.
A professor discovered that the students at the number one university in the world often have no idea about basic self-care.
The course, believed to be the first of its kind in the United States, was designed by Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.
His motivation for starting the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was only hearing about this now, in her final year.
He said that no one had ever spoken to him about the importance of the dream, which surprised me, &quot; he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first offered this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos; s health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were hardly sleeping during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, athletic shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are informed that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After that, an icon on campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students overnight.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He stated that the culture of "pulling an all-nighter" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and a good night &apos; s sleep should be &quot; the secret weapon &quot; of students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler &apos; s recommendation is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by screens of electrical appliances and LED, which can alter circadian rhythms, and thus end up having problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal puts Gerrard's men out of the running
The Rangers suffered another away-day depression when the attack of Dolly Menga saw Steven Gerrard &apos; s disjointed team go down 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to win their first away game since February 4-1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga's attack came just minutes before half-time and the Rangers' uninspired alignment was never in the game.
Now, the Rangers are in sixth place, Livingston in third, behind Hibernian by the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as judge of the line Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after allegedly being hit by an object from the visitor side.
Gerrard changed eight of the eight winners from the Ayr game, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, for his part, took the 11 Livingston players who won a point off Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his organised team outplayed their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made the most of the ball when he had it.
They should have been marked at two minutes, when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman that went between the defence, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the winger was beaten to the ball.
Keaghan Jacobs was given a 12-month suspended sentence for the assault on Captain Craig Halkett, but his co-defendant, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send it out on the long grass.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the game when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
The Rangers had two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly barely had a save to make as Lassana Coulibaly &apos; s header and Ovie Ejaria &apos; s tame effort came his way.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute was against all odds, nobody can deny that he deserved it for the effort he put in.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with a deep ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to score.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as Morelos passed to Kelly, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block him.
Still, Livingston kept the visitors exactly where he wanted them, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing a long passage for him.
The Holt team could have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow rounded off a corner to win by a head.
The Rangers substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty at the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the “Sunday Morning”: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and counting... born in Germany the future physical Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, was also a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film &quot; The Singing Hills &quot;, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans playing the apparently incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on the earphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals”.
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, at the age of 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can &quot; see &quot; a common protein in many cancers and re-reflect it.
A trial of the vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory to make them "see" a common protein called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “promotes growth of different types of cancer,” such as breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancerous cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West went on a rant in favour of Trump with a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It did not go well.
Kanye West was booed off the set of Saturday Night Live after an erratic performance in which he praised the US president, Donald Trump, and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often speak to a white person and they ask me how I can like Trump when he is racist.
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago, he said.
The show began with a sketch featuring Matt Damon as Brett Kavanaugh, making fun of the Supreme Court nominee &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the footage was not aired, Chris Rock uploaded the audio of West &apos; s tantrum to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the audience that he had a bad time on the set because of the hat.
They had it in for me.
They told me not to go out with my hat on.
They were at me!
And then they tell me I am sleeping, &quot; he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see me sleep?" and added that he "was going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
The story goes that he was a man of love.
His comments were booed by the audience on at least two occasions and the members of SNL appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confounded many when he came on stage wearing a Perrier bottle as a hat.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
I decide not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I think is embracing and propagating a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We also, he added.
Before the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been known as Snoop Lion, and the late music legend Prince has also changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those screen roles often told young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that she "thinks something went wrong" and questioned how to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, also admitted that he thinks "it's quite important" to address this issue.
"Personally, I think it is quite important at this moment, 'Where have we gone wrong with masculinity?' &quot;.
What have we been teaching men as they grow up, thinking about the problems they are now facing?
Kit believes that television can have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: &quot; What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and in the street, that makes young men feel that they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with the education of young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will star in True West, the Sam Shepard play about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that knowing his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so in that sense I have given my future family and my life from now on.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit, the character played by actor John Bradley, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm belonging to the family of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The great majority of these were infected sexually, which is a change from the past.
HIV traditionally spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way has been reduced to a tiny fraction, according to Chinese health authorities at a congress held in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community faces much discrimination.
Because of the country &apos; s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to the failure to use adequate protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked information about Republican senators and says the allegations are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican United States senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were driven by commentators and right-wing websites.
Waters commented on Twitter, "Lies, lies and more lies."
The information reportedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person in the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with Waters &apos; office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and a total lie,” continued Waters.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal details and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This allegation is completely unfounded and a complete lie.
Waters &apos; statement was immediately criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote, "Denies this information with anger."
This suggests that the temperance necessary to be a Member of Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
He must not rebel.
The accuser's motives must not be questioned.
He must keep calm and be patient.
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters &apos; reaction to the Democrats &apos; criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of seeming too angry during his Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who hopes to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If true, that is very serious, he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations."
He continued, "We will ensure that the perpetrators are found and held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all my staff."
Critic of Johnny English: Again in Action. Rowan Atkinson &apos; s spoof of the spy is a letdown
Now it has become a tradition to look for guffaws at Brexit in any new film with a British approach. This seems to be what to do with this new Johnny English franchise of action and comedy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satire about how clearly we are all mad be the new opportunity for the nation to export itself?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and blank face, has renewed his licence to get it wrong for the second time. His name alone gives away the fact that, more than anything, this is a creation designed for cinema-going territories where English is not spoken.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his odd claims to glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a hint of that sort of guy who played only one note at the Carros de fuego ceremony at the opening of the London Olympics in 2012.
In addition, it was originally based on the mysterious man traveller and international represented years ago by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television ads, causing chaos in his wake.
In this last part, there are one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter in full medieval armour while the rotors were hitting the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humour is rather thin and superfluous, especially now that franchises like 007 and Mission: Impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
The humour seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me, the absurd mishaps of Johnny English are not as ingenious and well-timed as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the super-secret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent on duty, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and cornered figure who is seeing her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to recruit one who is retired.
That must be the bumbling Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh school, although he also teaches undercover agent skills: there are some good gags, as it is a spy school like in the film School of Rock.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old pal Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submariner wife, a role that doesn &apos; t make the most of Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty &apos; s Secret Service return, with the beautiful but deadly Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic multi-millionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain &apos; s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a fashionable French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxury yacht of Volta; and English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house.
The last sequence was definitely well-executed, but, however impressive and loud it may be, it still conveys a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I could not help but wonder if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do his talent justice.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan to have Britons working four days a week, but being paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan whereby Britons would work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the owners of companies to use the savings from AI to give their workers an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea &quot; fitted &quot; into the plans and economic agenda of the party to tilt the country in favour of the workers.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As one senior Labour Party figure commented to The Sunday Times: A review of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
The four-day week is not going to be achieved overnight, but the party is definitely committed to it and will be putting it forward as part of its overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the general election in 2017.
However, not all Labour MPs are in favour of this decision at the moment.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day week is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at the moment."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was prepared to restore powers to "anonymous" and "self-interested" directors of companies that provide public services.
Among the shadow minister &apos; s plans is the idea that the current shareholders in water companies will not get their full share back, as a Labour government could apply deductions to reflect the perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10 per cent of shares in private sector companies would be allocated to employees, with annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice by at least a week and raises the question of whether the results could influence any Republican Senator who is still undecided.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could produce information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course, of course," said Kennedy.
I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, after all this had happened, and asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, determined."
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
He said, "I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would just ignore the accusation."
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett categorically denied it," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she names has been able to confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it succeeded in reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive roster of stars in support of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
This year, the seventh edition of the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park &apos; s Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
If you want a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), you have to complete a series of tasks or "actions," such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other thing that helps raise awareness about your goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved at 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of "clicktivism," which is the name given to the position we take when we think we are doing something really useful by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favour of a wide range of objectives.
Through these actions, they claim to have secured commitments and policies from world leaders worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that have arisen from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced almost 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition," a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom united by the common commitment to "help children grow and reach their full potential." To that end, it has proposed to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end the country &apos; s malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
Thanks to the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens partners like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition," to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also claimed that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we believe can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and hard road and, in many instances, we will fall and we will fail.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already shown, we will succeed in our aims, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers we will have at this year &apos; s New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of Russian energy exports - Department of Homeland Security
According to the Washington Examiner, "If necessary," Washington could call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up the markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia &apos; s alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is just a pretext for expansion into new markets.
He is convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier of the south of Europe."
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and means of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that shipping lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as "the consumer voice in energy" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia, he warned, is basically to exploit and replace fuels, and he indicated that Russia can only do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made at a time when the Trump administration has been trying to push its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to relieve Russia of its role as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted throughout that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has a value of 11 billion $ and is intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely economic.
The Kremlin defends that Washington &apos; s fervent opposition to the project is motivated only by economic considerations and is yet another example of unfair competition.
I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow last September.
The United States position has, however, met with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said: "It is a major problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, she said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a visit to the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was contemplating this challenge.
According to The Hill, "It is time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women in leadership."
I will seriously consider standing for the presidency after 6 November.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting and said "he was taking the country down the wrong path."
He said, "I really am concerned about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy."
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
A poll published on Thursday, however, found that a majority of Warren &apos; s own voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to the survey, 58 per cent of "potential" voters in Massachusetts said that Senator Kerry should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
A 32 per cent of those polled, however, supported his candidature.
The poll showed a greater level of support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for 2020 of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin &apos; s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
The situation that my son is going through, for everything that has happened since he returned, is known very well by the other families that suffer the effects of the TEPT and other wounds that our soldiers return with, "said to the public that gathered in a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo nobody wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other veterans of war that "they come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there is really that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence complaint and possession of a firearm while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new United States policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker who is facing the current directive, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" filed in August by the US Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against the federal policy has not been revealed.
He said that his companion "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but the US officials denied his request for asylum on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states, who defend Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA, for its English acronym) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum in the United States.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, made statements on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to the amicus curiae, "under federal law, all asylum claims must be decided on the facts and circumstances of the particular claim, and this exception violates that principle."
The lawyers also indicated in the brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the US economy by asserting that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide a needed workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to domestic abuse and gang violence victims in June.
Asylum may be sought by persons who leave their countries of origin because of persecution or threats on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said when he announced this directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to deal with all the problems, let alone all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us, "The situation is very tense." She was trying to comfort her feverish baby at a relief centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Ambulances are arriving every minute with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for whatever few belongings they have left in an effort to salvage what they can.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the injured; including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building because of the continuing aftershocks, which were also very strong.
He could not help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he had experienced while he was on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the rubble, I think," Haris told Associated Press. "I and my family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I don &apos; t know what &apos; s happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China was published by a Chinese government newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, the United States President, Donald Trump, referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the United States Congress elections on 6 November, something that China denies vehemently.
The accusation that Beijing had tried to influence the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing US campaign to pressure China.
While foreign governments are often known to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has led to increased tariff levels on both sides.
The compensatory tariffs China applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to be aimed at the exporters of states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, one of the top agricultural exporters to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
According to Branstad in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is intensifying this pressure with advertisements in our free press."
Branstad wrote, "To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press by attempting to place a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register."
Instead, in the newsstand on the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China may have about the troubling trajectory that their economy is on, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party."
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China" had declined to publish his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts point to the fact that the Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle.
As many as 20 Republican senators are closing ranks behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various sexual assault allegations against him, analysts have warned that a backlash could occur, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and many Republicans have stated that they want to move forward with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday that "there is no going back" on this issue.
Reeher said he doubted that the latest attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm the voters who were upset about this issue.
On Friday, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, Karine Jean-Pierre, said, "Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow, or in November."
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered outside the Senate were chanting "November is coming!" (November will be here soon!) as the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats, he said, "are off the charts," according to the nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg, at the news site.
People say that the impact is already very significant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even higher, especially among indecisive women in the outer suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote even if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts indicated that a backlash could occur if the Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
The story was that the Republican Party had been "in a big mess" over the matter, according to Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as reported by NBC News earlier this week.
"It is not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or even about whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench; it is also about how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know whom to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are on the side of this latter.
In a new YouGov poll, 41 per cent of respondents say they believe Ford's testimony definitively or probably, while 35 per cent say they believe Kavanaugh's testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake &apos; s push, the FBI is now investigating Ford &apos; s statements, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh violated her when he was drunk at age 17.
Ramirez, for his part, alleged that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project in the technology legend. A company that is based on the open source Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world."
He said, "It has to be now," about the startup.
It was a momentous occasion.
The application uses the Solid technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can contain to-do lists, pending tasks, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
Something that is unique to online personal data storage is that the user is completely in control of who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal data training."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's chief executive officer, John Bruce, is to bring together the resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach the world.
For the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce a radical change where all their business models are completely changed overnight.
We are not going to ask permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate on network neutrality.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added, "I am incredibly optimistic about this coming era of the web."
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only English clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
The Reverend Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a marksman four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren found a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "of a particular symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle for which his grandfather had been awarded the medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and artillery."
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage," advanced the line before reaching a single-handed gun and knocking down three of the detachment.
The lieutenant-colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather &apos; s actions were "so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a wreath at the end of the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is shown when he is given such a strong backing."
MMA fans stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 only to be denied the main event.
The San José billboard had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was to be broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised afterwards, having had to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to the cartoons as "a big joke."
A government regulation that governs the content that is broadcast after 6 a.m. was not met, so they had to change to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when we asked him about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig", yes."
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they will be modifying the programme to include British viewers in the next editions.
When I think about the option of the broadcast, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it is at 6 a.m. on a Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming changed, we received a great deal of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because we thought it was a technical problem at first.
But it was not so, it was a government problem.
I can promise that the next time it will not happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is the usual number, and we tried to give more than usual to the fans and we overdid it.
It is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but that was what motivated him to become a winner.
At 24, she told us that she did not realize until she got to secondary school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that his intention in talking about gay rights was to "give hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to take less importance in winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this mythical programme, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne, Daley, who was shown as a misfit, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the world during his childhood because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "That sense of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, and he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent face of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in this year &apos; s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he told the story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass on that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion declared that it was a real surprise for her to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married last year to an Oscar winner, who is 20 years his junior, although he specified that the age difference had never been an issue.
It is hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you have.
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
Asked last year what he would do if he won a gold medal, he said, "I would have to win a gold medal."
But you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is, without doubt, Robbie."
His son is named Robert, after his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father would not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
He said, "I was not able to tell him that I could not be in the front row."
He said, "I had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it was only then that I realized that he was not invincible."
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
I knew then that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to compete in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This was also the inspiration for his first song, Proud, which accompanied him during the preparation for the Olympic Games, and he still gets goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad statistic.
Mickelson, who was playing in the biennial event to set a record for 12th time, was beaten by the captain, Furyk, in the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the thick of the action, as he has so often been in the United States, the five-time major champion had to content himself with cheering on at times and, at others, trying to perfect his game on the course and thus be able to correct his faults.
Never the most direct of drivers, not even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form for Le Golf National, where the long rough constantly punishes errant shots.
And if the course is not challenging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth round on Sunday, faces the brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, had started in such an impressive fashion, Mickelson's match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, but could say no more.
He understood the role he had today, he gave me a pat on the back and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably did not imagine playing two games at once.
He thought there would be more, but that is how it turned out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass the record of 18 matches played in the Ryder Cup set by Nick Faldo.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cup career that he had never equalled so clearly his individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, but Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He is "fun, sarcastic, clever, likes to wind people up; he is great to have in the team," he explained.
I think it was a great boost for the younger players to have him as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It adds much more than just a game."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows only too well that, even with a substantial lead in the last few days of the Ryder Cup, he can easily turn it into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end only managed to win by the narrowest of margins, 14½-13½.
Bjorn, who was depicted after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead 10-6 on Saturday at Le Golf National, said, "You keep reminding me that we won a great tournament at Valderrama; we also won at Brookline and lost, we won at Valderrama and lost, but by the narrowest of margins."
The story will teach me and everybody else that that equipment is not finished.
You have to give it everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not stop until the points are in the bag.
We have a goal to achieve, and that is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on our 12 players, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, and they are the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn &apos; t want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual actions and this is different.
It is great to share what is going on with a partner when things are going well, but when things are not going well, you are really testing your golfing skills.
That is the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it is time to leave your partner behind, go and get the best out of yourself."
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to play better individually than they did as a team, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points from four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the spectrum in the last few days of these big tournaments, being part of the winning team at Brookline and then losing when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
I remember every word," he said when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-importants tomorrow, but we have to play as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure is on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
Bjorn said, "I was with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole route."
The new German battleship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era vessels, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to faulty systems and the increasing cost, local media reported.
The handover of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the handover scuttled the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies of invisibility, such as radar, infrared and very low acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, allowing for deployment up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continuing delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the far reaches of the world) will already be out of date by the time they start to operate, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that a ship had been returned to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "critical software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly serious, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120, half the number of personnel on the old Bremen class ships.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy &apos; s ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons is twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed that it has reached the 3.1 billion euro (US$ 3.6 billion) mark, instead of the initial 2.2 billion euro (US$ 2.8 billion) target.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the navy was "going without ships that can deploy."
The official said that the problem has been getting worse over time, because old ships have been decommissioned but not replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, carried out in a Scottish Highland county, seeks to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that all that is learned will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton &apos; s bats and long-eared brown bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in strategic locations on the property to track bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Experts will analyse the sounds on the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the bats and what species make them.
A report and map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed image of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they use them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be managed for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affect their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and power lines can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide-treated building materials and other chemical treatments, and attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not actually blind,
They are nocturnal hunters, and their hearing is more useful than their eyesight in catching their prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocation that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the matter of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts, who carry out regular surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescues.
The charity has even opened the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
"We have a fantastic bat roost here at Threave," he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there are still many things unknown about bats, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance work inside the property, as a breeding colony could be unintentionally destroyed and 400 breeding females and young could be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, or to destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we know nothing about their populations."
Ronaldo denies the rape allegations while his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has labelled the rape allegations as "fake news" and says that people "want to be known" at his expense.
His lawyers have been instructed to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the statements.
He is accused of raping a woman from the United States, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying 375 000 $ to keep the incident quiet, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already garnered 142 million followers just hours after the news broke, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," he says, looking straight into the camera.
They want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to be famous by just mentioning me, but it is so, I cannot help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," he added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appeared in what they called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, the player's lawyer, said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player &apos; s room and there, allegedly, Ronaldo raped her anally, according to court documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo had knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good boy" and that he had let him down with the "one per cent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and that they took photographs of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was "terrified of reprisals" and worried about being "humiliated in public."
The woman, 34, claims she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a great club in Italian football, for a fee of 100 million euros.
Brexit: the UK will always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if we lost our position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would temporarily stop.
Mr. Clark said, "We need an agreement."
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of delays at customs on a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 per cent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
Marvin Cooke, the chief executive of Toyota in Burnaston, said: "My view is that if Britain leaves the EU in March, there will be production bottlenecks in our factory."
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement, particularly in relation to cross-border trade; these include Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car industry are around the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is based on the just-in-time (JIT) method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU to build cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a disruption at the border that, according to the industry, could cause delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than one day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, which sets out the future relationship with the EU, is "tuned precisely to avoid those checks at the border".
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only gets us through this moment but that we can take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
The evidence from Toyota, among many others, is that we have to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a tremendously successful supply chain."
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production will be halted, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, ultimately, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is Unite's shop steward there, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "From my experience, once those jobs go, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting of President Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week," as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, links between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not and thus compromise the independence of Mueller has fuelled the Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone he carried himself in an attempt to remove the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, where he was reported to be on the verge of resigning.
Instead, he announced a meeting with Trump (who was then at the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said he would "rather not" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, but this would delay the Senate floor vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be another, considering all that is going on with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the spot and I will inform the press as I usually do.
Some journalists would dispute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what the motives were.
Sanders said that the shortage of press coverage was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who grandstand, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are grandstanding."
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The president, he said, had more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him, and he cited, without evidence, "We have checked those numbers."
Press conferences will continue, said Sanders, but "if the press has the option of asking the President of the United States directly, I think that is much better than asking me.
We have tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
Indeed, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why he was so, where he made an uninhibited and, at times, bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish NHS is writing to EU health workers about their fears over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU workforce working in the Scottish HSC to express the gratitude of the country and its wish to continue working with them post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of applications for citizenship for EU citizens working in public services not under central government control.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom Government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know that all this must be very confusing for you.
And it is for that reason that I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each and every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to have you as part of our family."
Christion Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a player for the Tennessee State Tigers, was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday, when the Tigers lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
The Tennessee State coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
Reed said, "He came to the band and fell there."
Both the trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for a thorough examination.
A member of the staff at the Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris of WSMV that Abercrombie had been discharged from the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury or damage yet" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding a total of 18 for the season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to provide shelter for the "homeless", according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the land tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year, which will be spent on the "homeless."
The additional money raised from the increase in the stamp duty on foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the "homeless," Theresa May announced today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralise the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his pledges to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in the land tax will be levied on people and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivise the government &apos; s policy to combat begging on the streets.
The stamp duty, which is an additional charge on the current stamp duty, also includes an increase in rates two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, which could be as high as 3 per cent.
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year from this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not reside in the United Kingdom, which is causing prices to rise and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's most affluent areas (especially the capital) have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people get on the housing ladder.
He accused the big builders of keeping prices high by buying up land in bulk and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to abolish the "shameful" affordable housing quotas in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a very attractive set of reforms for housing, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
He also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life chances of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy houses more easily than the British working class.
The dream of home ownership has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of sleeping on the street remains all too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland manager says his "primary objective" is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is upbeat about the prospect of reviving the club in the north-east, which currently occupies third place in League One (the third tier of English football), three points behind the leader.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only managed to get a B" hat, Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a boy and it is something that has always made me want to come back.
This opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully."
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he moved from such established names to a club as big as Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, success for me is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club are, without doubt, those of the Premier League," he said.
It is not easy to get, but I would only consider myself successful here if I could return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell in the Hearts technical department.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and helped St. Mirren go from being on the brink of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims that he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled that it was probably a turning point when he took over Alloa.
I always believed that the direction was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was good at it, I could make a living at it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to deal with a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure from that work; however, I feel good in the direction.
I always wanted to train and now I have done so, it is the time of my adult life when I have felt best, without a doubt."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted takings in British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on the chains.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA, the consultancy which compiled the figures, said: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have still kept July on the same level as June, when pubs increased their takings by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants have even fallen a little further.
The 1.8 per cent fall in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their best month, compared to the majority of restaurants, where they reduced their profits.
The pubs that mainly serve meals also suffered from the heat, although not as drastically as the restaurant operators.
People seem to want to go out just to drink.
Sales in managed bars and pubs rose by 6.6 per cent during the month, while sales in restaurants fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, a hospitality and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the OOH market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8 per cent fall in sales compared with last year is going to be particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering industry, and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, is collated and analysed and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents &apos; backs
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts behind their parents' and teachers' backs, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted among 20 000 secondary school pupils, revealed a growth in the number of false Instagram pages.
News reports have heightened fears that sexually explicit material will be published.
About 20% of the students said they had a "main" account that they showed to their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) create social media accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20 000 secondary school pupils revealed the rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
News reports have heightened fears of the publication of sexually explicit material.
About 20 per cent of the students said they had a "main" account that they showed to their parents, while they had other private accounts.
A mother who happened upon her 13-year-old daughter &apos; s secret MySpace site saw a teenage boy encouraging others to "violate" her.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half admitted to having private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the need to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland &apos; s most decorated athlete on both track and field and its president, Ian Beattie, described the move as a great opportunity for those who want to see sport benefit from his great international experience over the past decade.
Beattie said, "Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletics community, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from her involvement in its leadership."
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to bring things and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, between the four golds he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischaemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I have now fully recovered and am now doing exercises to regain my agility.
Thanks for the messages and words of encouragement!
The announcement of the milkman who compares mothers to cows has divided opinion on the Internet
A sacaleches company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing mothers who breastfeed to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is in theory the "world's first silent breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with a bit of ironic music showing mothers counting the freedom their new breast pump gives them.
Four real women dance in a hayloft, with cows, with signs like: "Yes, I do it myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Order them, order them, I am feeding their babies, order them, order them, I am milking my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company &apos; s Facebook page, has created a great deal of controversy.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it succeeds in putting the spotlight on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant before they can give birth to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after they are born," wrote one person.
The Elvie breastpump is discreetly concealed in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Terrifying for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to announce a breast pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a crazy announcement."
However, other people defended the announcement, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "destillante."
I think it is a great idea.
If he were still suckling, he would surely have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit outlandish, but I am not going to dwell on it.
It is a brilliant product,” said one woman.
Another person commented: &quot; It is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The advertisement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.
The video ends with the women showing that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no tubes or wires, and is discreetly attached to the breastpump, allowing users to move, hold their babies and even go out in public with the pump in use.
Ana Balarin, Mother &apos; s ECD, tells us: &quot; The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and milking cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant minors quietly relocated to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased significantly, despite the fact that monthly apprehensions at the border have remained at near-normal levels. In part, this is due to the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be required to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Around 80 per cent of the sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” said Albence.
In their rush to process juveniles more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of their arrest, rather than 60 days, as the previous rule, according to workers at the shelters.
Many will testify by video conference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered fit for the amparo will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers at the holding centres and the reports of the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they are held, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the advocates, these concerns are even greater in larger facilities, such as at Tornillo, where it is more likely that the signs of distress in these children will be missed because of the size of the facility.
Furthermore, the move to the camp without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare themselves or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma, which many are already suffering from.
Syria calls on the "occupation forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country &apos; s war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the matter would be dealt with accordingly.
He said to the assembly, "They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally."
Moualem insisted that the “war against terrorism is practically over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would “continue to fight in this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advice to the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces that are opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that made them decide to stay away.
He said that the Government had asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate such returns.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel bastion of Idlib has created an opportunity for forcing political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that the military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will be "eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the terms for the Syrian government &apos; s participation in the committee, arguing that the panel &apos; s work should be restricted &quot; to reviewing the articles of the current constitution &quot; and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely hope, a premature impeachment or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would be without doubt "The most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!"
For the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the spectators.
Since 2014, the ratings achieved during prime time have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and have nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has surpassed cable news channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for its top-rated prime-time news programs.
“It is an odd attraction that we still do not understand,” Neal Baer, the show &apos; s executive producer, tells us. &quot; It is a strange attraction that we still do not understand. &quot;
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys &apos; Club,” has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him that he would vote for Trump.
Why?
Scovell replied, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is always high in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you have been watching six hours of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear," the $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket of Paul Manafort ("an ostentatious display of wealth," in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels &apos; scabrous descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
Offering something new every night is in part what makes everything seem like a reality show," says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of "Pawn Stars," when he talks about the alternating Trump show and its daily plot twists (whether it be entering into a fight with the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
I remember when we used to do all those crazy programmes and people used to say that was the beginning of the end of Western civilisation.
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows into the midterm elections of the House of Representatives.
It is no surprise that the money is flowing into the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking reelection to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure was recently redesigned, is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another Republican challenger, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding contest between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Campaign Committee (DNCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political experts have given the Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed down.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight Washingtonian hiccup.
Trump had a friendly meeting with the President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Organization Trump evicted the management team.
The State Department officials decided to recall the heads of the United States diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
But El Salvador, which had already received some 140 million dollars in aid from the United States, was singled out for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, the United States and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials in the administration made it clear that their intention was to proceed with the conference, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman rejected comment on the details of the debate described by the three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of Robert Mueller, the special counsel, on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there is already considerable public evidence.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating the possibility that the Trump campaign was working in tandem with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to run again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, or that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to take decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The story revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The United States is now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating on his unfitness for office.
Rosenstein says that The Times &apos; explanation is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new investigation the F.B.I. has requested on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will have a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador &apos; s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles at the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the start of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
We got a good result, Villarreal is a good team, said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing we could get something and ended up with nothing.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game. But with all the support of the crowd behind us, I am sure we can get a good result.
Last year was definitely tough on my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be all right.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying themselves immensely and we are having a good training session.
I hope that we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.
The fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their families.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the steps to have this conversation, says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
This is the way to begin.
Speak with your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options can be a factor in the cost.
Include in the conversion your financial adviser, as he may also be able to help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Their options for long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help them pay for their care or self-insure with their own savings, if they have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: be ahead of the legal battles.
Arrange for a power of attorney to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and to ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
He can also prepare a notarial power of attorney for his finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don &apos; t forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
“It is not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors are we going to have to deal with?” asks Martin.
What drugs are you taking?
Who will look after the dog?
It is necessary to plan everything.
Shots are fired at a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They have shot at a man with a rifle as he walked home after dark.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (BST), as "random."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications blocked, the aid workers have been unable to get any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is a hierarchically subordinate administrative region, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The province also has a significant nickel mining industry, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is frequently struck by earthquakes.
The following is a summary of some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake on 26 December 2004 in the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of the victims in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 killer earthquake and tsunami.
This time, it did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) was hit by a series of major earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a Wasilla, Alaska, resident, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report issued by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a well-known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin was remanded to Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked to make a statement, the channel reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could mean up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a sentence of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska veterans court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that she had hit him in the face.
Several veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son &apos; s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after a quake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communications networks have been down and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just to the side of the centre of Sulawesi, which is located to the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for a suspect in the New York terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out a bike path attack in Manhattan's West Side Highway last October, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused "serious" bodily injury, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek a death sentence, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to the prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, &quot; as specified in the notice of claim.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a capital case.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal execution in New York was that of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This couple was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police also said that he had asked for the flag of ISIS to be flown in his hospital room.
He was found not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a plea of guilty to a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved.
Saipov &apos; s defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised "to mobilise the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the EU negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already come out" if Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more by a group of Tories in favour of remaining joining a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers deal on track, with attacks from Brexit supporters, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that he would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between his package and "chaos."
Leave Means Leave MP Ben Habib said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
He dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: "I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public at large does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: &quot; Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises &quot;.
Farage told the crowd that the politicians would feel the heat if they were to betray the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
We will mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing United Kingdom that is proud.
Meanwhile, the pro-remain campaigners took to the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists were holding up placards reading "Tories Against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for the security problems they had with an application of the party during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of running for president
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility of Warren facing off against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th town hall meeting with voters using the town hall format since Trump took office.
A staff member asked him if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for "women to go to Washington to straighten out our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top."
A suspect in the shooting death of LSU football player Sims
The Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, the previous Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the crime scene, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98m-tall player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton in qualifying on Saturday, it was clear that the orders from the Mercedes team would play a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of the picture by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to go into the boxes and let Hamilton run in his slipstream, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strongly on the next lap and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a move with wheels almost touching that made the Ferrari driver give up the inside line at risk of being overtaken later on in the next corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 on the day, started from the back of the grid and finished seventh in the first race.
He led a large part of the race while clinging to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and to overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he made it into the top 10 on lap 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to recover fourth place from Raikkonen.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job in finding a perfect pair, &quot; said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there was "bad, repugnant and false" people.
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false."
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say "But I didn't do it.
I did not do it.”
Do you remember?
Did you leak it?
Remember their response... did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I did not leak it.”
Well, wait a minute.
Have we leaked it? No, we haven't leaked it,” he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was leaked in early September, but she denied that it came from her office.
“I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I did so.”
But his refusal did not sit well with the president, who during the Saturday night rally commented as follows: "I will tell you one thing: that was really bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.
Continuing with his defence of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don &apos; t care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get the power and control,” said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the New York Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars avenged the defeat by beating the Belfast Giants 5-3 in the return match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead of two goals thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local score before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured victory.
This was the third defeat in a row for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast the previous Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute (3:35) with an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered an exciting start, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10, with Matt Marquardt assisting Cownie to equalise at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalised the score with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and the victory was secured with the fifth goal of their team in the closing stages.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to let hundreds of people escape on the earthquake plane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after dying in the line of duty to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to shake the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport control tower, which was being buffeted by strong winds.
He stood firm to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He jumped from the air traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are breaking at this,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of victims is expected to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people have not been able to contact their loved ones, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
A six-metre wave that reached Palu has devastated the city, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible to the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country &apos; s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
CNN reported that the United States was ready.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in the early part of this year, killing more than 550 people in Lombok.
Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the air crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening, a male passenger had not been accounted for.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The airline and the United States Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had overshot the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very low.
That, said Jaynes, was something extremely good.
Jaynes comments that he and other passengers were able to wade through water up to their waists to the emergency exits of the plane as it began to sink.
He said that the passengers were in a panic and were screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that the sailors who were working nearby on a dock improvement project also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the aviation safety network indicate that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none on Air Niugini.
A timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution finished its case in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014 on Saturday.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the mobile phone records to track the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Chambers &apos; phone had been with his, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The records of the motive indicated that they were known only one week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers &apos; death, Tellis deleted Chambers &apos; messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, &quot; He erased her from his life.
The defence is due to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be in the hands of the jury that very day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its original roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Acts such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a text message she sent was deemed "racist"
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the demand to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay at discovering that the new childminder, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” she wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "disgruntled" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent the money home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with an intention to receive compensation of $350 per day for the position of six months of internal work for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
He told The Post on Friday that he wanted to show them that things were not done that way, and added that he knew it was a case of discrimination.
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that Maurice &apos; s termination was the most reasonable course of action, as they feared that they would not be able to trust him after having offended him.
My wife had sent him something he didn &apos; t want to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racists,” said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
What about your newborn baby?
Come on!”
Comparing the demand as "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to go for someone like that?
That is not very decent, said the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, criticising them for their behaviour and their logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond &apos; s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: &quot; It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before publication.
It is now very funny to know what we know about the great success of Paddington.
After saying that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the children &apos; s book, had hoped his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had been &quot; bittersweet &quot; after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very quiet man and did not like to boast.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something important: you were proud of him, though it was not really your achievement.
I believe that he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to the real Paddington”.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
On landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said, "He was calling regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that they didn't expect him to succeed."
I got a call from Nad to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said to him: "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I will be with you shortly.
I will be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were wearing off and leaving his system.
She had died too soon and everything was fading.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not howl, cry or shout because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm on that.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was about to have.
He said, "Nobody knew."
I bent my head and tears were constantly falling.
It is difficult to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much she loved him.
Widows wearing black to prevent suicides is a bridge too far.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
He said, "I do not want any father to feel as I do every day.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any place.
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found it after Tyler had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried about the impact."
Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people to go to and people to talk to, even if it is a friend.
You can &apos; t keep quiet, you have to talk about it.
Ms. Humphreys, who is a friend of Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
He did not say he was depressed or anything like that, he tells us.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day, the nadir was reached: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to get over it: "It leaves a gap in the whole family.
It has left us in ruins.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited time, a limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity to it,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going off the rails” in the midst of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to proceed?
Their refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
There are only five weeks to go to the mid-term elections on 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans do badly, their attempts to get the man they want into the Supreme Court will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife, Ashley, who was the President &apos; s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The figures of North Korean defectors &quot; fall &quot; with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said that 1,127 people deserted last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by people smugglers, had been the key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment on the matter.
The vast majority of the deserters from the north are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most defectors flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers desertion illegal immigrants rather than refugees and, frequently, they are repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting in Singapore between United States President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the lack of progress on United States sanctions.
Without the trust of the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm, &quot; Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysteric" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Asked about her reaction to Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, Pelosi said, &quot; I can &apos; t get over the fact that if a woman had done that, they would have said she was hysterical. &quot;
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking up while talking about his family and his years of high school.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the allegations against them "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by angry liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
He said, "I think he disqualifies himself with these statements and the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats."
Pelosi objected when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed to the Supreme Court and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
She said, "I have one thing to say: if he is not telling the truth to the Congress or to the FBI, he is not fit to be on the Supreme Court, he is not fit to be on the court he is on now."
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, which is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for an hysterical and partisan person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine,” said Pelosi.
And women have to wield it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury, and she cannot let it go without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so unusual, do you?"
He continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was talking: "Perhaps you think I am crying because I am angry.
No, I am not angry.”
And then he went on with what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are permitted as a way of letting off steam in part because they are not really understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once finding myself in a rage I could not express, with tears streaming down my face, at a senior woman manager, whom I had always been slightly afraid of, grabbing me by the throat and dragging me up a flight of stairs.
He told me, "Never let them see you cry."
They have no idea that you are furious.
They think you are sad and will be glad because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board a boat called Monkey Business, which forced him to withdraw from the presidential race, deeply frustrated Schroeder, she thought, there was no reason why she should not explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," he said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they did not need another one.
Someone called us "Blancanieves y los siete enanitos".
As the campaign was already well under way, he fell behind in the fund-raising, so he was promised that he would not be allowed to enter the race again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do you think I get a discount?” he asked.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotion (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on capturing voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
"It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown," said Schroeder, recalling the reaction of the press.
You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, &quot; What will they put on my tombstone? &quot;
Did he "weep"?”
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, according to experts.
President Donald Trump of the United States issued the first warning in early 2018 when he imposed tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which will tax half of the goods that come into the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has retaliated with equivalent measures, recently applying a 5-10 per cent tariff on $60 billion worth of American products.
China has pledged to match the attacks of the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon back down.
To back down would be to concede to the demands, but to submit publicly to the United States would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the US trade war could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a rapid policy decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a sudden collapse in the economy in either country is in fact far more dangerous than has been recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, associate fellow at the Center for New American Security focused on Asia issues.
Syria ready to welcome back refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, the foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, said that the country &apos; s conditions were improving.
The situation on the ground is today more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in an attempt to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that, since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people living in the country who still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last victory in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, hit his tee shot on the 16th hole, par 3, to admit defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari highlighted his rounds, becoming one of the four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world No. 1, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio García, who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European player with the most wins in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
I do not usually cry, but today I cannot help it.
It has been a very tough year.
I am deeply grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to win the cup.
It was a team effort and I am very proud to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now the torch is being passed to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday by 2 and 1 in a match play event.
I feel an incredible sense of pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, as I grew up watching this man play golf," said the 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is an odd statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, leaving him only one behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf all weekend.
The American captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team &apos; s disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these boys, they never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we spoiled it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Their 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now we must bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.”
