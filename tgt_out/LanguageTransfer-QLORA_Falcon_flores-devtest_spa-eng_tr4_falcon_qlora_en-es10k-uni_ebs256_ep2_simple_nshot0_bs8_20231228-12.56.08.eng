In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plumbeous, a theory that is already generally accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this bird has a reddish brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or caroteneous color on the lower part.
Moreover, the discovery helps to understand better the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Given that the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called the raquis, but does have other features of feathers (wings and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raquis is probably the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but to temperature regulation or as an indicator of the same. Researchers maintain that although the sample analyzed is that of a young dinosaur, the plumage shows characteristics of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, although the specimen is of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

While there are reports that indicate that the official death toll is eight and the authorities have confirmed that approximately 30 people were injured, the official death toll has not yet been established.
Concentrations of cianide acid and melamine were found in the urine samples of animals that died after ingesting contaminated pet food.
The researchers indicated that the two compounds react with each other to give rise to crystals that can obstruct renal function.
The specialists detected the formation of crystals in the urine of felines, due to the incorporation of melamine and cyanuric acid.
When compared by FTIR, it was determined that the composition of the crystals coincided with that found in the urine of the affected animals.
I do not know if they have noticed this or not, but the majority of the products coming from Central America arrived in this country free of taxes.
However, the countries of Central America still impose tariffs of 80 percent on the products we manufacture. We treat them as you.
I thought that was unfair; it was definitely not fair.
All I can say to the people is that you treat us the same way we treat you.
A bill was proposed by the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, which prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.

While she is under custody awaiting trial, any statement by a witness can be questioned, since her image has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "it seems that journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects"
The Office of the Crown, which is responsible for the prosecution, indicated to the press that it would not make any further comments until the indictment is issued.
According to the information that has leaked out, the document will deal with the border conflict, which the Palestinians intend to resolve based on the existing boundaries, prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also addressed, according to information received, included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA only accepts five.
During the complementary trial of pest control, the game wardens had to supervise the shooters closely, since this was monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the NSW Association of Sporting Shooters, volunteers were recruited who were suitable for the Association's shooting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS Park, pointed out that a comprehensive training and safety course was provided to the four selected shooters for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its Spanish initials) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised that the previous CEP should resign, as part of a series of measures designed to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the generalized demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, at times violent, were provoked by the fact that elections were not carried out, in some cases since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods with malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, which resulted in six fires and minor burns to four people.

Dustin Oro en Poudre Runnels declared: "Luna is as rare as I am; even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Since 2008, among the 1,400 respondents surveyed in advance of the 2010 federal elections, there was a 8% increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting Prime Minister, stated during the 2010 federal elections campaign that she considered that Australia should become a republic once the Queen Isabel II's mandate had ended.
34% of the respondents share this view and want Queen Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In one end of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, 31% believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner in the freestyle 100 metres and 200 metres must swim in the freestyle style and three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned on the basis of his complaints.
He not been able to take painkillers because their use is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using different hardware and software and it was announced on February 1st.
It is possible that cometas hayan servido como fuente de agua para nuestro planeta, así como de materia orgánica, la cual tiene la capacidad de formar proteínas y de sostener la vida.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets, particularly our own, were formed, given that comets have collided with the Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office at the beginning of the year and the month past and signed a law that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He qualified the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen es un sistema que, según afirma la Administración Federal de Aviación, reduciría las distancias de las rutas aéreas, lo cual ahorraría millones de galones de combustible por año, así como las emisiones de carbono.
Uses satellite technology, in contrast with the old radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate data.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered the possibility of playing the game closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the magazine Science published an article on the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, in the United States, and from Uppsala University, in Sweden, reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the reproductive isolation between a Darwin's endemic pinion, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus-migrating pinion, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on any shape and be rolled up into tiny figures.
It is not only possible to hammer and roll up in sheets, but also to stretch it until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it can be used to decorate illustrations made by hand in books called "manuscripts illuminated".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the juice of turnip will be altered depending on the acidity or alkalinity (alkaline) of the chemical substance.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product analyzed determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Mix both dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, express them to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in their hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with discharge in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some households of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had sanitary facilities in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by means of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to provide us with a much simpler and faster means of transport.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and antelopes.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including domestic cats) that feed on small species that are more abundant, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the big cats that most socialise and their life takes place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family, united with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Generally, the females relate closely with each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in the same way as wolf packs or dogs, with a surprising similarity to the other great cats (in contrast to the other large felines), both in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a complete athlete, it can climb (but not very well), swim, dive, jump five times further than a strong person, and pull five times more than a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-bodied roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. Insofar as possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Most of their prey will be smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) by smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark and hidden places, and they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they come (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were accustomed to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
No se han producido cambios en la población original, que todavía necesita las mismas adaptaciones que en el pasado.
As the population grows, as it adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble less and less the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will not be possible to classify them as belonging to the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an ineludible consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
Plant food is generated by solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, plants offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and also make clothes from them. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, therefore, it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth like knives, plus another group in the palate, which means that anything that comes in front of him has no escape.
We do not have the certainty, but it could have been a viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and even cannibals.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a dinosaur as large as the T. Rex was no threat to him.
While most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that distinguished them was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the wealthy enjoyed banquets and ate on the side.
It is not possible that the recipes of the ancient Rome included foods that arrived in Europe centuries after they were introduced in America or Asia.
They had no maize, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and no Roman of antiquity ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
The people carried sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
In some cases, special towers were built with a pyramidal shape, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
The Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the patio; shops were only show windows facing the street. Houses were built with stone.
In Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Few people lived in Greenland. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him more westward, discovered the island and gave it its name.
However, the discovery of the site did not prevent the Eskimos from living there at that time.
While each country was Scandinavian in its own right, there were significant differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "National Treasure", you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who drafted it, it is known that the document was drafted shortly after its creation, and that it was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
While the landings carried out on D-Day and the subsequent confrontations had liberated the north of France, the south still remained.
His government was in the hands of the French of Vichy, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched the operation "Dragon", through which they invaded the south of France.
In only two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that belongs to a large group of people who live and work together; in other words, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city state, and which also determines the size of the society.
The state cities are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogeneous propagation.
The minority cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and they are not recognized as civilisations in their own right.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was the only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and since it had a national executive or judicial power, this function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to enforce all their laws.
He was not empowered to annul fiscal or customs laws between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval by all states for their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, together with the German selection, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, figure skating, ice hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan there are about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is usually referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's history goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who were sailing in the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the establishment, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty Army (1644-1912) took control of the coastal and western regions of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this last as a dependent province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three major buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings in the complex have been reconstructed to enable tourists to see how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and the work continues today.
To illustrate, the most common format for fixed-image photography at the global level is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the era of analog film.
Today, this phenomenon still occurs, but the most important thing is that the dimensional relationship has been transferred to the formats of digital image sensors.
In truth, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, since its width is 36 mm and its height is 24 mm.
This is why it is said that the dimensional relation of this format (dividir par 12 pour calculer la plus simple des raisons numériques) corresponds to 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g. the APS group of formats) are similar or very similar to this aspect of the relationship.
The rule of thirds, which has been the object of constant ridicule and many times ridiculed, is a simple rule that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing a certain order to be given to the images.
He indicated that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting European states, despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected all, from the monarch to the people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be reserved for that specific purpose.
The central leadership of the Church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, this measure violated generally recognized and widely accepted international legal principles and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain extracted water from international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even putting at risk, even, the neutral ships.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would meet a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid that such a situation would occur in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poems and a recommendation letter written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years, from the Han Dynasty to the Jin Dynasty.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms Period, in which thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
These have many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, since now the charges are based on the caliber, instead of the class.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed workers in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has endured in time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
On the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and in complete isolation from the rest of the planet, lies a cave.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one is sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains in the vicinity. From the interior of this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramidal structures of great size and built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The mark "upward arc" is similar to a V and the mark "downward arc" is similar to a graphe or a square without its lower border.
Above means that one should start at the tip and push the bow, and below means that one should start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The ascending arc produces a softer sound, whereas a descending arc is more abrupt and harsh.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but do not forget that the marks on the string instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife, Marie Antoinette, and their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Luis Carlos, 4 years old) to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook his head at the execution of a guardia real in front of the Queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the expenses of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interest on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From the outset, les super profits résultant de l'exploitation prolongée du peuple philippin constituaient les profits principaux du capitalisme nord-américain.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in Europe in which these events take place is known as the Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The technological determinism is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from the technological impulse to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and its relation with the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technological effects are inherent and not socially conditioned.
One could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a reduced number of cars, so new techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The determinism of the cultural element was very present in romanticism, according to studies by Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography moulded people and, over time, customs and cultures developed related to that geography, which, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to arbitrary laws.
As Paris is known today as the city of fashion, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicentre of luxury began approximately in 400 BC and extended until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its status declined, especially because, on their return, the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the Xth and the XIVth centuries.
In the beginning, the dress received a great influence from the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the Western styles could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that period was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Agriculture of subsistence is understood as that which has as its objective the production of sufficient food to meet exclusively the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple practice, usually organic, which combines the use of stored seeds from the region with crop rotation and other simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of the farmers was subsistence agriculture, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality with respect to the social standards and provides them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to resort to distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashion, gestures and jargon.
One of the most common mechanisms for graphically representing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some of these children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or fleeing.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When a child is reared exclusively by animals different from humans, he presents behaviour (within his physical possibilities) almost equal to that of the animal that cared for him, as well as his fear or indifference towards people.
Although learning based on projects should facilitate this process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in real or virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also a small animated subject sheet in Microsoft Office is a scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to understand on his own.
The children are taken into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No ningún niño debería tener que crecer, jamás, en un entorno en el que no haya cariño, cuidados y educación; pero sucede.
We can perceive that the system of family reception provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our system of foster care is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The objective of family placement is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home from which the child was removed with prior placement.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and communication between people.
The different characteristics of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of users to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), the "personal participation" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that, by reading microexpressions appropriately, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", explained how those who cannot understand speech because of a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of the speaker with precision.
He even suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the 20th century it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
The segregation and recombination of genes are the main factors that determine the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of man, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available to it.
Moreover, not doing so entails serious problems: slowing down of growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have constituted the easiest source of vegetable resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except when cooked.
On the other hand, the animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not surprise us if our predecessors resolved their "protein problems" in the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Interruption of sleep consists in waking up intentionally during the normal sleep period and sleeping again after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved easily with a relatively soft alarm clock, which will bring him back to a state of consciousness, although not completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, the applicant will have to register his presence and the address of his accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a diuretic known to be) before going to bed, which will oblige him to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension that is present in his body and in his spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we can cope. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all attain illumination. The only thing that obstructs the path is our tension and negativism.
While the basis of Tibetan Buddhism is the teaching of Buddha, it spread along the path of the Mahayana of love and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, the laísmo es muy sencillo. Se basa en el kundalini yoga, la meditación y el camino del amor que todo lo abarca.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be cleared, the chakras activated and the consciousness of enlightenment developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
The war would last for 40 years and would be fought in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that Poland's defence was already broken down on September 17, 1939, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize itself in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union entered and formed the fronts of Belarusian and Ukrainian later after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the right to transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The Atlantic North Campaign in the Second World War is one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, la armada alemana, empleando principalmente sumergibles, intentaba anular esta circulación.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did in the other European countries.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the aim of obtaining their milk, hair, meat and skin easily, the ancient peoples and tribes started to keep them.
Domestic goats are usually gathered in herds that wander the hills or other areas of grazing, and are often tended by herdsmen who are children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd. These methods of grazing are still used today.
In England, the railways had been installed in the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to maintain the rails in their place took place rather early. However, gradually it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels and, in 1767, iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transport known was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking erect.
While bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more friendly with the planet, join environmentalist movements or even become activists and fight to reduce, to some extent, the suffering of the future.
It is, in many cases, like the asymptomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, the draft was sent by hand and signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, to the printer John Dunlap, who lived a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not represent them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have clawed limbs and have eggs, they move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate in binary code.
A binary number can only have two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to allow a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is finding an open bottle of medicines or cleaning products containing toxic chemicals.
Read the label to obtain specific information about the first aid pertinent to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasite insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with the chinches, a species very developed to parasitize humans.
The bedbugs and the bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) registered in the United States is estimated at about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the union of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies showed that women have twice the probability of men of suffering from EM.
A couple could conclude that it would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child to have a baby.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a child.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way in which the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guide for the vast majority of scientific investigations.
This is not an experiment, however, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of naturalists and philosophers was placed on the classical works; especially, on the Latin translation of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those on science, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, the West distanced itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Frequently, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free cyclic period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA consisted of a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fungus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic fragment and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation may have different effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations occurring in other parts of the body can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks, and study of information on the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take photographs and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often meet others whose jobs are located in the place from which they have just come.
In this dynamic transfer launcher, all are somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and support it.
At present, los científicos sostienen que esta economía masiva del carbono ha privado a la biosfera de uno de sus estados regulares que ha contribuido con la evolución de la humanidad durante los últimos dos millones de años.
All are part of society and use the transport systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints and why do they fail so often? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make precise predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency among drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which makes it possible to represent the traffic flows approximately by means of mathematical approximations.
In order to graphically clarify the circulation flow, relations were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations facilitate the planning and design of road infrastructure as well as the operation of road infrastructure devices.
The first species to take flight were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, pressing them against their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of possible hiding places in small areas that are less likely to be preyed upon by predators.
At present, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the anisopterans and the ephemeropterans.
In ancient times, a man called Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, ¿correcto?
The Amazon River is the most caudalous and the second longest river in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazonas is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers, 20% comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the pyramids of Guiza, nor in size nor in the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
The Vatican City State, with approximately 800 inhabitants, is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Italian is used in the Vatican City for drafting its regulations and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that is spoken daily by the majority of those who work in the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All the citizens living in the Vatican City adhere to the Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This is similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but it also has the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be the elements calcium and potassium. Already, there are metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
As a result, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They do not even need to approach a pencil.
The only question is what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy cart rolls up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases part of that energy.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, that is, they tend to disintegrate with the minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer shell is called the crust.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km in the near side and about 100 km in the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the side closer to the volcano because the crust is thinner, which facilitated the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines maintain that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they have grown up to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes some people to want certain things and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's theory of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
The managers in this category find it difficult to take decisions that are unpopular with employees, to impose disciplinary measures, to carry out performance evaluations, to assign responsibilities and to demand accountability from the staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an unknown person who believes it necessary to change everything that has been done until now and do it in his own way.
In the end, the ultimate responsibility for the success and failure of the team lies with the leader.
This form of behavior often leads to the leaders of the team being distanced from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Frequently, the members of a virtual team act as a point of contact for their physical closest group.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet at different times, which, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of managing and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organization to submit itself to the process of establishing an organization for learning? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all available resources are used appropriately in operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
The result of this, it is possible that the process of an organization that works in teams to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process to meet the needs of customers.
To make an organization innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and give it greater precision.
The correlation existing between brain pathology and abnormal behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time it has been known that several types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the emergence of new technologies, we now have the possibility of seeing and investigating structures and processes that have never been seen before in the brain.
This provides us with abundant information and material for developing simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a speciality of great importance within computer science, which is responsible for the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Research in the field of AI implies the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to diagnose and respond to customer queries, as well as facial recognition, handwriting and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence System is now used frequently in the economy, medicine, engineering and the military, in the same way as it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a good way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the page is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as a memory album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with a grammar and spelling that are not very careful, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Due to the fact that students are the readers who most criticize, the blogger begins to make an effort to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Likewise, the blogosphere "requires that students be more understanding of the world around them". The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through an active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics.
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and has a variety of museums and galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting it of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
These aspects, among others, are those that make Ontario intrinsèquement canadien aux yeux des étrangers.
The large areas towards the north are sparsely populated and some are wild lands.
To make a comparison of the population that causes surprise to many: in the United States there are more African Americans than Canadians.
The location of the islands of Eastern Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest island and a continent in itself if we are talking about wild life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the Comoros and Mayotte by the Arabs and was largely imposed, in part, in these islands.
The initial impact of European and colonial influence took place in the 15th century, as a result of the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, of the route linking the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region borders on the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it is not too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in rejecting men and do not fear defending your position (even if there existent cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians, who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of White House, but in 1755 they abandoned it after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Sultan of Morocco with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who established their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared to tourists.
Goma is a tourist point in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the eastern border, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left most of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the country must be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the province of North Kivu, where the armed confrontations continue.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo Volcano and its gorilla trekking excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To move within Goma, you can opt for a motorcycle taxi (mototaxi). The regular tariff (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This is added to the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, which has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and distant image.
Tombuctú is a poor city today, but it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included in the World Heritage List, which is the result of the threat posed by the sands of the desert.
It was one of the most important stops on the African Wonders special, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecological zones, in each of which a different wildlife lives.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all the natural reserves of South Africa, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island of Hong Kong, which is the destination of most tourists who consider it the main attraction.
A comparison has been made between the buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong and a luminous bar graph that is evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and go to Kowloon Bay, located on the opposite shore.
The development of the urban area of the northern coast of Hong Kong is concentrated in the reclaimed lands.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove chain in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast towards the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangroves, but also contain some of the last remaining trees of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprende une superficie de 3850 km2 et environ un tiers de sa superficie est recouverte par l'eau ou des zones marécageuses.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a sanctuary for wild life and it is estimated that there existent in the area 400 tigers of Bengal and some 30 000 spotted deer.
Buses leave the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) all day, but most, especially those traveling to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are usually full of passengers, it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Almost all districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cantilever structure that spans it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is expected to be completed by September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will end.
The area that currently constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the indigenous group most important in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá groups, for example, hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
Spanish settlers began the colonization stage, which lasted three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and matches of lower level can also be seen in other parts of the year.
At the site of the Argentine Association of Polo, the visitor will obtain information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the pound sterling of the Falkland Islands (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in relation to the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank in the islands. There you can change your money. It is in front of the West FIC store, in Stanley.
Sterling pounds are accepted in any place in the islands. In Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
There are chances that in the periphery islands credit cards will not be accepted, but they will be able to use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to define the method of payment accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money outside the Malvinas Islands, so it is advisable to do so before leaving.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the tropics, with frequent temperatures above 30° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: although it is rare for temperatures to fall below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no stations specifically "rainy" or "dry"; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild life is still wild, and it is not advisable to feed it or disturb it.
According to the instructions of the authorities of the parks, the minimum distance to be maintained from bears and wolves is 100 yards/meters and from all other wild animals is 25 yards/meters.
Although they may appear dociles, it is a fact that bisonte, uapatí, alce, osos y casi todos los animales grandes pueden ser agresivos.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries because they do not maintain a safe distance from the animals. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.
He also reminds you that the smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so he should avoid cooking foods that release a lot of aroma and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of approximately 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except for a British cruiser. Two hundred Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland has two ports. The most famous ones are located in three areas.
In the North Harbour District, in the Pacific Ocean, are the beaches of North Shore, which extend from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
Most of the beaches are sandy with safe places for swimming and most of them have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
In the Waitemata Harbour, the beaches of Tamaki Drive are unfolded in the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and it is not complicated, but rather refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a great variety of French wines, those of New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transport.
The water from the tap is completely safe for consumption, but if he is concerned, he can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the notion of "coffee white and flat" foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year and, there, wounds of any kind are rare.
