Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are concerned that they will appear "like muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Member of Parliament said that his group was concerned that it would end up with "Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means idiot and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that his whole group was "disappointed" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element in the name of a Member of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed strong support for calling a Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the option MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
It appears that Members of the Assembly are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring the president of the Assembly, Elin Jones, to a standstill, as she would have to send the bill for the changes through in a few weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes related to the operation of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members and the design of the committee system.
The final decision on the naming of the Bills will be made by the Members of the Assembly when they deliberate on the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the country &apos; s name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether their country will change its name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia &apos; s President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin &apos; s bells are silent in the difficulties of Harlem churches
The elderly people with whom he has spoken say that there was a bar and a church on every corner, historically.
Today, there is neither one nor the other.
He noted that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
Now people socialize in a different way, he says.
“The pubs are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods that people go to regularly.”
He is concerned about the churches, that the money raised from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders hope and that "before long, they will return to the starting point."
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks full of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore they will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped there acquired the building.
A black congregation took over San Martin, under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while the congregation of Father Johnson made plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, called them "the poor man's campaigns."
In July, the expert on the carillon called it a "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first snare drum ever used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who played it at Riverside Church, a larger drum, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that San Martín did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the parish governing body, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the parish board, although it had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old boy shot by shark while diving for abalone in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the opening day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon &apos; s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about 30 minutes on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, so he swam over with a group to rescue him.
Hammel said that at first he thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then realized that he was "screaming that he had been bitten."
Hammel noted that the boy &apos; s collarbone was broken.
Hammel added, "I yelled at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark."
The child was flown by helicopter to the Rady Children &apos; s Hospital, where he is in a critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescue captain, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area some weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper chest area.
The authorities closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there were more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's beauty plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury &apos; s buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff in their beauty and style departments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at £2.8 trillion and with growth outstripping that of fashion and homewares, the largest beauty halls in the country will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range, with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second of which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The online shopping and the shift to daily small-quantity purchases in local stores have forced supermarkets to work harder to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will increasingly resemble shopping centres as the supermarket chain tries to combat discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points into hundreds of outlets and introduced several Habitat stores since it bought the chains two years ago. It is claimed that this has boosted food sales and made the acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion about how to split the income from the pharmacy counters in its supermarkets.
The new strategy is being pursued following the sale of 281 pharmacy outlets to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is participating in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers."
We have also invested in a specialist staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs, and our attractive environment and convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11m deal
Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones was “furious” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the fashion and accessories brand Truly.
This business had compared favourably with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving the business.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the TV gold dust admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for her Truly fashion and accessories brand.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was shaping up as a favourite to double Willoughby &apos; s fortune, which was estimated at around £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving the business, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented, "Holly truly made this her top priority."
It was to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved totally stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters, ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain &apos; s most successful stars, could cost the company millions of pounds due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and sails to clothing, and possibly delay the launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as president in March.
The couple were on holiday together and Jones had a 40 % stake in Baldwin &apos; s television production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said that last night "we didn't talk business."
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some might consider "not presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented with his mock-newscaster voice.
“I haven &apos; t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting him again after Trump had praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he had considered a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea &apos; s chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country was not seeing an "adequate" response from the United States to its first steps towards denuclearization.
In contrast, he said, the United States was still applying sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump &apos; s speech was much more optimistic in his rally.
He said, "We get on well with North Korea."
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of missile tests, help in releasing hostages and bringing the remains of American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to Kim by speaking of the relationship.
It is very easy to be president, but then, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we would have 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” says Mrs. Sumbung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palu, but they are still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations would be allowed to provide assistance.
Given that Indonesia is a country where the earth is constantly moving, it is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even if there was a prior warning, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
Traveling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge at best.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the new disaster enclave.
President Joko Widodo has made the upgrading of Indonesia &apos; s worn-out infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who faces re-election next year.
It must also contend with the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes as bands of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other crude weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, equalises the score for Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat at Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a Shaqiri pass from just over 27 metres out to make it 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot and tapped it before sending it to the second pole.
The action was sent over the area and headed towards the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the balloon passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
“I was trying to get myself in that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq, who always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and gave him a nudge. I didn't think about it too much, I just fired.
Chelsea was leading 1-0 at half-time after Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' left-back, David Luiz, made a late tackle on Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning and playing a neat one-two with the ball near the halfway line and then running into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle.
He then took a nice trip into space, which brought him to the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished with a left-footed shot into the net from the edge of the area.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Liverpool plays Napoli in the Champions League group stage. The match will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Meanwhile, Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the country &apos; s disaster agency at the start of Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six metres, according to the agency &apos; s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press briefing.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder of a woman who was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7.55 a.m. on Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
He would also recommend anyone who has seen anything on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who claimed to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that nobody can enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to discover what had happened.
Now, residents are being told that they will be allowed back in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent telling a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was seen crying at the scene.
He keeps repeating, "It's terrible."
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon, controlling the floor.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, or to call Merseyside Police on 101, or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, reference 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament Square becomes the latest commemorative success by "rewriting history"
Its banning would be a poetic act of justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects and artefacts in England by its fanatical puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick &apos; s suggestions as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, a century earlier.
The magnificent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft Cromwell by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema is a testimony to the opinion of the nineteenth century and to the views of some historians who consider him worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, clearly, the monarchy."
If it is a completely accurate description, then it is a matter for further historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A Chinese farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery severed and covered in blood near a pigsty in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pen in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
He apparently travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that there was a big pig with blood on its mouth in the pigsty.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
His uncle, Wu, told the Guiyang Evening News that his legs were "bloody and smashed."
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not one of Yuan &apos; s or his cousin &apos; s.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It appears that the family of Yuan and the market authorities are negotiating a settlement for his death.
Although rare, it is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it off.
After pigs ate a rancher in Oregon in 2012, a rancher in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious - their intention is not to hurt.
What is needed is the appropriate respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the south-west of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters off the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to much of northern Mexico and the south-west United States in the coming days.
Rosa produced gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday morning (Eastern Standard Time) to 5 a.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) and was located about 620 km south-southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressure systems are starting to develop in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rains northward, towards the southwest United States.
Rosa is expected to leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical rain hits the low pressure system approaching, widespread heavy rain will occur in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible sandstorms in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation rates of almost 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Because of the nature of tropical rain, flash floods may occur suddenly with conditions that rapidly deteriorate.
For this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms could cause local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching low-pressure system will bring heavy rains to specific parts of the southern California coast.
Heavy rains can leave as much as two inches of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make the roads slippery.
This would be the first heavy rains of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will start to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before widespread rain arrives late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and all day Wednesday.
In October, the United States may see some intense temperature changes as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
Sometimes, this means drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of this is what will happen across the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, an early October warm spell is expected, with widespread temperatures in the mid-20s from the South Plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees Fahrenheit, some 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term outlook indicates above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the policy remained in limbo and the media interrupted their regular programming to report the latest developments from Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake to have the FBI conduct a week &apos; s investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had groped her while she was drunk and that he had tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his impassioned testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who watched Nielsen on Friday may have seen it.
The company tallied the average audience for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels that carried it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has some problems in calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a crowd similar to that of a playoff or Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh &apos; s nomination, led the pack, with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers for a day-long appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 billion, NBC had $2.94 billion, MSNBC had $2.89 billion and CNN had $2.52 billion, Nielsen said.
There was a great deal of interest after the presentation.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the cameras of CNN and CBS caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
As he was being scolded, live on CNN, he looked downcast.
One woman looked me straight in the eye and said, "Looking me straight in the eye."
“Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?”
And he continued, "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
He said that his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the lift closed, that he would have more to say to the Commission.
The cable and broadcast networks aired everything live hours later, when the Senate Judiciary Committee had to vote to recommend Kavanaugh for the Senate to vote on.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the following week, which some Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake &apos; s decision was critical, as it became clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of "playing politics"
Theresa May, the Prime Minister, accused her critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference to be held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the newspaper &apos; s front page, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to share customs duties was "completely absurd".
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson in the murder of LSU player Wayde
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder by the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson &apos; s DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 bond has been set, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head that had entered the head.
The department acknowledges the efforts of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police crime lab, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at LSU, thanked the local police for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game during the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "in shock" over the death of Wayde.
These are the things that people always worry about, said Wade.
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed signs of activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre recorded several tremors and shakes.
The images showed thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, 72 km south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between anti-riot police and pro-independence demonstrators as thousands of people took part in counter-demonstrations on the first anniversary of the polarised Catalan independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists who had been stopped by the riot police threw eggs and dust at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in the evening and the police used batons to quell the fighting.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans such as "No forgiveness, no forgetting," faced off against unionists, shouting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but which separatist Catalans celebrate.
The voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, as those opposed to secession boycotted the referendum in large numbers.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, where there were violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would ever become independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite a narrow victory in the December regional elections, the procatalanist parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, await trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
He said, "It is getting tighter and tighter."
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
“To stand for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for crashing car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday at about 1930 hours on Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there was damage to the access and the building itself.
At some point, the car may have been shot at with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga &apos; s first goal for Livingston secured the victory
A Livingston-inspired Rangers impressed the Rangers players by securing Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga &apos; s attack made the difference. Gary Holt &apos; s team took a post, with Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face leaders Hearts, who have an eight-point lead.
The Rangers get Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its winning streak to six games in the six-team division. Coach Holt, who has not tasted defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month, has yet to taste defeat.
Livingston lets slip a chance to impress a visitor
The Holt team should have been a step ahead much earlier, causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers by their direct approach.
Scott Robinson beat the defence but missed the target from in front of the goal. Alan Lithgow then missed the target after a shot from Craig Halkett from in front of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-handling.
That was the decisive blow.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston sought an entry, combining a Declan Gallagher and Robinson move for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that point, the Rangers were in control, but they were unable to break down the defence of the host, Liam Kelly, who was quite relaxed.
That game continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers &apos; goalkeeper, blocked a Scott Pittman shot with a kick, and Lithgow was well out of the way of another Livingston effort.
There were long passes in the Livingston area constantly, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were rejected, one after Halkett &apos; s substitution of Glenn Middleton and one for a hand.
“Fantastic” from Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous view is that they did a great job and continued to exceed expectations with a steady upward trajectory.
Their style of play and their squad have hardly changed since their promotion, but that is largely due to Holt's ability to strengthen the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was huge and led a well-organized defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good times with Gerrard, they came up short.
They failed to execute the plays, as they only managed to get into the opposition's half once, which is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
Smiles and blue skies were in evidence on Saturday, 29 September, at breakfast for the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey &apos; s EU membership.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police cited security reasons for preventing 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers turned up in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also spoke out against both his policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street junction, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at 1015.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by the paramedics, but he died there and then.
The accident occurred after another cyclist was killed after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of Saturday &apos; s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the Director of the prison.
The disturbances started at Long Lartin prison, in Worcestershire, at about 9.30 on Sunday and are still continuing.
A team of elite specialists (called "Tornado") is in charge of controlling the disturbances, involving eight inmates and affecting one pavilion.
The agents received minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service says: "Specialist prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin prison."
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time behind bars.”
Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital care after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, prison officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep across the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern Nevada and eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind on Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix tweeted that "only 10 hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950."
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 km of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of torrential rain, which can reach 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 inches of rain, with the possibility of up to 10 inches in isolated areas, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Rift Valley.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, the Rosa rains are a blessing, as the region is suffering from drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains may be beneficial because of the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which will still be a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 mph (219 km/h) on Sunday morning, is 619 miles (1,000 km) south-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving northward at 19 mph (31 km/h).
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to arrive in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
Heavy rains of 7 to 15 inches are expected from Baja California to Sonora in the northwest, with the possibility of up to 25 inches, as reported on weather.com.
Rosa will then head north to Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression. It will then move south through Arizona into Utah by late Tuesday night.
The main danger to Rosa or its remains is the torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and southwest USA.
These rains are expected to cause sudden flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Four arrests in Midsomer Norton: attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he is "stable."
Four 17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to the Avon and Somerset Constabulary.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party"
Trump said voting for Judge Kavanaugh was a vote to reject the "shameful and disgusting tactics" of the Democratic Party.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that "Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh on Saturday.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our day, a jurist with an admirable record of public service,” he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made indirect references to the Kavanaugh nomination in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
I did not present myself, but I did run the race.
That is why I go from one place to another, fighting for big names.
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
A key procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds dead in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that have battered the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday to celebrate a festival when waves of up to six metres high arrived at night, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When yesterday's tsunami warning was issued, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, everything on land,” said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The pounding continued on Saturday for the coastal city.
The earthquake was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The BPPT issued a statement saying that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which is built on the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely down" and there was "no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
The Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people were living there, and that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency came under fire for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities say the waves had already reached the coast by the time the alert was issued.
In a recording made by an amateur and shared on social media, a man can be heard warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching the building.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in the area around Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a visit to the evacuation centres planned for Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
That is very bad.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala had arrived safely in Palu, where they were sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they had seen a devastating scene on their way there, he said.
He said, "They told me they had seen many houses destroyed."
It is a very bad thing.
Even as the relief gears were being put into motion, some people were complaining that relief workers with extensive experience were being prevented from going to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And that has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the Government says it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but it has not happened yet.
Friends and relatives of the people still missing after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolate stories written by natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small child was rescued from a manhole.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor with the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Other students of his who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel included Mr. Mandagi.
"From my experience in the field of paragliding, I bring my own emotional baggage," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a grey checkmark, not two blue ones.
He said, "I think that means the messages were not delivered."
Thieves made off with $26,750 during a cash-in-transit robbery at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, two robbers accosted a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, making off with $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM machine located in the entertainment centre and was preparing to reload it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money intended for recharging.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will start to be called Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time now, a name he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
She replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the creator of the show commented.
In addition to being a short form of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, which means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year while discussing the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
“You are me, you are us, means us.
It went from being Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving them monthly stipends for those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I. A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after announcements by several parts of the U.S. Government, including when, in general, the United States lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are way behind the United States. We are looking forward to the next step in the field of I.A.”, says Lee.
Double funding means double chances for the next big breakthrough in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important I. A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an I. A. system that defeated the best American player of Othello. Subsequently, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
He acknowledged previous technological competitions by the US Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It is not China that is taking the academics; it is the corporations," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent academics from universities to work on I. A.
Lee commented that changes in U.S. immigration policy could also help to intensify U.S. efforts in I. A.
He said, "I think that doctors in I. A. should be given permanent residence cards automatically."
The State Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In early 2001, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from industry and academia. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research into I. A.
Meanwhile, the United States has been unable to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence in Security for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change their name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name should change to "Republic of Macedonia of the North," a gesture that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which had blocked its membership bid in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Slav population, the majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50 % required to make the referendum valid.
The referendum ballot paper asked: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to help Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje, said: "I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all."
Although it will not be legally binding, many members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote so that it is decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, said: "I have come to vote for my children, we belong in Europe."
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on changing the name of the country, which would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents pitched by those who were boycotting the referendum.
Kavadarkov said, "We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door."
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.
The Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, whose unemployment rate is over 20 per cent.
Zaev said he believed that the majority would be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of citizens were in favour of the EU and NATO.
He said that a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future."
A survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Studies claimed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which would be lower than the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, in Macedonia, revealed that 57 per cent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, evades the whole Brighton defence to score
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart Brighton's defence as Manchester City won 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian half-back received a yellow card at the start of the game.
It ran between three defences of Brighton before entering open country.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded one defender before out-skirting several others in the Brighton area.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit it with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that hit the right post.
Pep Guardiola, the City coach, told the press that Agüero had a problem with his foot.
We are talking about 55 to 60 minutes.
That was what happened.
We were lucky to have scored at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave Manchester United the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In this play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton territory.
He did a lovely left-footed pass to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave the aircraft a few taps before directing Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky blues forward scored just before leaving the pitch.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. local time at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies' party
With the Nationals out of the conflict, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to reach the summit on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have playoff hopes.
The Rockies at least secured one wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still chasing their first division title.
Although we didn &apos; t have anything to lose, at least we could step on the rubber with the assurance that the Denver crowd would be excited and that the other team would probably play at the level I &apos; ve played against all year.
Why wouldn't you want to be part of it?"
The Nationals are still to announce a starter for Sunday, but it looks as if they are leaning towards letting Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th opening, had a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The record of the Washington pitcher is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 appearances.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia
He made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
In November, everything we have done is at stake.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I do not stand for election, but I do go from one place to another, fighting for big names.
He continued: "We have a terrible radical group of democrats, they are here now."
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and we see the meanness, the evil.
They don &apos; t care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that &apos; s what they want, power and control, and we &apos; re not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, were engaged in a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
“We have seen it these last four days,” he said, saying that the Democrats were “angry, bad, horrible and false.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, nominating Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his response?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I hope you will give me an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.”
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are told that we are not welcome, just for saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment, categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, for Europe. It was ironic that he was disagreeing with leaders who had been in office before.
As stated in the notice of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more friendly and compassionate" policy is already long forgotten, if it was ever implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged in terms of whether the party leadership considers it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision began to expect him to change his mind radically and to adopt positions with which he had never been comfortable, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one to have experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, as my comments tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist abuse, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that broad range of views and, with every "motion of censure" or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many suggestions to keep my head down and not make too much noise and then I will be fine.
But I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student at the age of 16, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, and I certainly did not do so in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday that I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Momentum in Nottingham, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal and no political opportunism will stop me from acting in the way I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an unbeaten Ayr rises to the top
Two late goals may have decided the final outcome, but without doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Premiership match.
He is now leading the table and is the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make better use of opportunities, that gave the local team the victory, so Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
He said, "We have been tested in all ways and we are still standing, so I have to be happy."
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, commented: "Ayr deserves the recognition, they took the opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson &apos; s conversion at the 14th minute put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, on loan from Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the opposition &apos; s disadvantage and Jason Baggot converted a penalty.
Climax extended Ayr &apos; s lead with a penalty kick. Earlier, just at half-time, he scored and converted a solo effort, leaving the score at 17-5 in favour of Ayr at the break.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson &apos; s conversion by Baggot reduced this difference to five points.
There was a long delay after Ruaridh Knott was injured and had to be carried off on a stretcher, and when the game resumed, Ayr took the lead with a converted Stafford McDowall try by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed them to take advantage of the fact that they had one more man with a non-converted Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the locals recovered and when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson to please Climo without the ball from the penalty spot, MacPherson made a shot when he was in the back of the maul as it was advancing.
The weather, which had been a factor in the game since it resumed, turned on him, as it had done almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe kicked the ball sent in by David Armstrong and Gregor Henry went down in the goal to make it 5-0 to the locals.
The Still Game star wants to focus on the restoration sector
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems determined to move into the catering business after it was revealed that he had been appointed manager of a chain of restaurants.
The actor, 56, is Jack Jarvis, who is best known for his role in the BBC comedy show, which he writes and co-stars in with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source at the Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming Glasgow restoration market."
“The sea is ours”: a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Navy headquarters are in La Paz.
The blue flag flies from public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the motto: "The sea is ours by right."
It is a duty to recover it," he said.
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the nineteenth century, as well as the yearning to sail again on the Pacific Ocean, are still remembered vividly.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and calm, and is waiting with a positive vision, said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is also engaged in a controversial battle for re-election next year, has much to say about the resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia &apos; s favour and that the situation would change little if it did.
The UN agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice reached a decision only six months after the final submissions indicated that the case was "not complicated," said Chilean expert Paz Zárate in international law.
Far from promoting Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
The problem of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration, said Zárate.
He also suggested that Bolivian President Evo Morales &apos; s bellicose rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to keep talking after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia would be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 years of mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The resolution is an opportunity to see what we need to leave behind.
North Korea says it will not give up nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to give up nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come as Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, appears to be on the verge of restarting diplomatic nuclear talks that have been stalled for more than three months since this summit with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.
He says that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that would end the Korean War and bring the North under control is a "pipe dream."
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration without some meaningful disarmament movement from Pyongyang.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang &apos; s disarmament, which the country may regard as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is expected to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The latest Paris fashion parade reveals the last line of huge hats about to land on a street of shops near you.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of large-scale eccentric hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the runway.
Valentino &apos; s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large items included pineapples with jewels, a witch &apos; s hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of outlandish masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-on lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One looked like a full scuba diving kit, complete with mask, snorkel and fins, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you are in luck.
The big-hatted hunters predict that the huge hats could soon be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats are coming in strong from "La Bomba", with a wide-brimmed hat with a 60 cm brim worn by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label behind this impractical hat that flooded social media presented another great creation on the runway: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini that carried it.
The Jacquemus La Riviera orange-black raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus spring-summer 2019 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
As stylist to the stars Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the high street. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are vital for citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the examinations, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in the areas of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are intended to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for their place in the world as citizens.
As a sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, modern languages are still popular and in demand in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you talk to his head. If you talk to him in his language, you talk to his heart."
If you talk to them in their language, you reach their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if one wants to establish relations and build trust with people from other countries, one cannot rely solely on English.
If we look at the recent results of this year &apos; s examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables, with the pass rates in independent schools being the highest.
Overall, 68 per cent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved an A, the highest grade.
Data from the 74 centres in the SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A in Chinese, 72 per cent in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that will certainly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now considered on a par with the core subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 per cent of the reasons given by employers for difficulties in filling jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential for employment requiring language skills is increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whether someone chooses to run, swim, or play tennis, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a skill like this, which will last a lifetime.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put that person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and it was also established that the only language spoken by a two-figure percentage, 15 per cent, was French.
For this reason, investing in language education is important for today &apos; s children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, they will be equipped to have better opportunities for quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more traditional modern languages, while others will teach the more important languages for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools he or she will always be able to choose from a range of languages taught by specialist staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing an environment of learning that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages are "competencies for international communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Well, you have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron James to debut with Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for the fans who are waiting to see LeBron James make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Luke Walton, the Lakers &apos; coach, announced that James would play in the opener of the preseason on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is still unclear how long the game will last.
Walton commented on the Lakers &apos; official website, "It will be more than one and less than 48."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers &apos; six-game preseason schedule.
At this stage of his career, he said, "I don't need pre-season parties to prepare myself."
Time for Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation of his nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court in the run-up to the mid-term elections, Trump is seeking support for the next elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. this evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see it online via a live YouTube broadcast.
It is likely that Trump will comment on this week &apos; s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which were overshadowed by allegations of sexual misconduct and have left a confirmation vote in the Senate on hold for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main aim of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans facing the November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, the Trump campaign announced that the five rallies next week are intended to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and the House," according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that Trump will travel to as many states as possible as the campaign begins, a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
The rally tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling is expected to attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage from Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, who is falling behind in the polls.
Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters that it was not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come and push him in the polls.
Ryder Cup 2018: the United States team shows that it is willing to fight to keep the hope of individual matches alive on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needs.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept, but the players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
So where is the impetus now?
“We were six points ahead and now they are four points ahead, so I guess that is a little bit of a boost,” said Jordan Spieth after the round.
Europe, of course, has an advantage: four points ahead with twelve more on the line.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel they have a bit of wind in their sails and plenty of reasons to be cheerful, not least the partnership of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and managed three points apiece.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and preaches by example.
The guttural roars of celebration grew louder as the round progressed, introducing a vital putt for a tie in the fourth round when he and Thomas were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the lead on the 15th was greeted with a similar roar, one that suggested that the US team was still in the game.
"What we need to do is redouble our efforts and focus on the game," said Spieth.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable pair of Europe are four for four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only pair that did not bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the last nine holes of Friday morning.
This run and the way it flows with the noisy crowd of Sunday spectators makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, two different holes, preferably in different locations.
Still, it is premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio García, the hero of the four-ball morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help on Sunday to get out of the holes.
The foursomes and fourballs are fascinating to watch because you see the interplay between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they don &apos; t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the United States team is not afraid to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe started the final day of the Ryder Cup with a good lead after the fourballs and foursomes had finished with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods who was in trouble, gaining four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a US team that made many errors during the foursomes in the morning, which ended 3-1.
The United States was more stubborn in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership helped to beat a dejected Woods and a nervous American Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who had not really shone for either side on Saturday, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the fourballs in the morning, was Henrik Stenson &apos; s partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world &apos; s number one and number three players respectively, 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and calm in southwest Paris, Europe was not having all its luck.
Jordan Spieth, the three-time winner, and Justin Thomas served as a reference for the Americans, who earned two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has ever recovered from a four-point deficit in the individual matches, but Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they were the second best for two days, it seems that mounting a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament if it does not have confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his country &apos; s mistrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, including halting nuclear tests and missile launches, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received any similar response from the United States," he said.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of unilateral disarmament.
Although Ri repeated the familiar North Korean complaints about Washington &apos; s resistance to a "phased" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement was important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an American president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working for "the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can give up its arms.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a declaration of the end of war,” Ri said.
The idea that sanctions could make us fall on our knees was a fantasy of people who did not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our mistrust.
He made no mention of any plans for a second Trump-Kim summit, announced with great fanfare by the US leader at the United Nations at the start of the week.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri &apos; s tone was radically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to aim North Korean missiles at US soil after &quot; malignant president &quot; Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim &quot; rocket man &quot;.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions should continue to be applied until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, "The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the full and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions unanimously on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused South Korea of "demands like those of a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures."
He said that Kim had told him that the "measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough sleep
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all students are now trying to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of all-night studying fuelled by caffeine.
A professor discovered that students at the world &apos; s number one university had little idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was just hearing about this now, in her final year.
He said that nobody had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos; s health services, noted that the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were getting little sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a routine for going to bed.
In another section, participants are told that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then an icon of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that students will not change their behaviour overnight.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of "pulling an all-nighter" still existed and added that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was becoming a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good night &apos; s sleep should be the &quot; secret weapon &quot; of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since lack of sleep makes the brain feel hungry, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar programme of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler &apos; s recommendation is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by computer screens and LED lights, which can disrupt circadian rhythms, and thus have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga goal sinks Gerrard men
The Rangers suffered another away-day depression when the Dolly Menga attack saw the disjointed Steven Gerrard team beaten 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to secure their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, the Premiership leaders.
Menga &apos; s attack came just minutes before half-time and the Rangers &apos; lacklustre alignment was never in the game.
Now, the Rangers have gone down to the sixth, Livingston up to the third, behind Hibernian by the goal difference.
The Rangers may have more problems, as judge of the line Calum Spence had to be taken to hospital after allegedly being hit on the head by an object from the visitor side.
Gerrard changed eight of the winners from the game against Ayr, reaching the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, took the 11 Livingston players who earned a point for the Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-drilled team dominated their opponents throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when he had it.
They should have been marked at two minutes, when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman, who was left alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her off.
Keaghan Jacobs took a deep gouge on Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, could only get it out by the long pole.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction in their play in the final third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the game when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian appeals.
The Rangers had two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly barely had time to get his head in the way of Lassana Coulibaly &apos; s header and Ovie Ejaria &apos; s tame effort.
Although Livingston &apos; s goal in the 34th minute was a surprise, nobody can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with a deep pass from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to score.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the latter had an almost immediate impact, as he handed the ball to Morelos, but Kelly, who had been on a tear, came off his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to take his visitors exactly where he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing a long stretch after long stretch.
Holt could have made more of a break in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow took the corner flat out to win by a whisker.
The Rangers &apos; replacement, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty in the final minutes of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and counting... born in Germany was the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Singing Hills," with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the earphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, aged 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a common protein in many cancers and redirect them.
A trial of the vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein called HER2 in many cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “promotes growth of different types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancerous cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West went on a rant in favour of Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn &apos; t work out.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after a performance that was erratic, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often speak to a white person and they ask me how I can like Trump, who is racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the program with a sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock posted the rant on social media.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
West also told the audience that he had had a hard time backstage because of the hat.
They gave me a hard time.
They told me not to wear a hat.
They gave me a hard time!
And then they tell me I am asleep,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see me asleep?" and added that he was "going to put on his Superman cape, because that meant nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?"
“Try it with love.”
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and members of SNL appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died recently.
West confounded many when he came on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier to sing I Love it.
West received the support of the leader of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
But I decide not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I think is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We also do,” he added.
Before the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been known as Snoop Lion, without forgetting the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those screen roles often told young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, also admitted that he thinks it "quite important" to address this issue.
He said, "Personally, I think it is quite important at this time, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?"
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?"
Kit believes that television can have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on television and in the street that makes young people feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with the education of the young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends this summer, saying he was "tired of battlefields and horses."
In November, Kit will star in True West, the Sam Shepard play about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
He recently revealed that he believes knowing his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, I have given my future family and life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm in Scotland belonging to Leslie &apos; s family.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of these were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way has been reduced to a total of zero, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community faces much discrimination.
Because of the country &apos; s conservative values, studies have calculated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to the failure to use proper protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican senators and says it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized the allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democratic senator from Los Angeles said that the allegations were being driven by commentators and right-wing websites.
Waters commented on Twitter, "Lies, lies and more lies."
The information allegedly included the addresses and phone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office, and the Capitol reported that the data of a Waters staff member had been made public.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a total lie," he continued.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a total lie."
Waters &apos; statement was immediately criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer dismissed the information with anger.
This suggests that the necessary temperance to be a Member of Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not get angry.
It should not be rebelled against.
The accuser &apos; s motives should not be questioned.
He must remain calm and serene."
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during his Thursday testimony.
Republican Omar Navarro, who is challenging Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
He tweeted, "If true, that is very serious."
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations."
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally accountable for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all my staff members.
Johnny English: Back in Action. Rowan Atkinson's spoof spy is a letdown
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new British-themed film, and this is what seems to be the right thing to do with this new Johnny English parody of action and comedy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satire about how clearly bonkers we are the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his licence to make a fool of himself for the second time. His name alone gives clues that this is a comedy aimed at territories with non-English-speaking film audiences.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent, despite his odd claims to glamour, who has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a hint of that type who only played one note at the Carros de fuego ceremony at the opening of the London 2012 Olympics.
It was originally based on the mysterious man traveller and international figure represented years ago by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television adverts, causing chaos in his wake.
There are a couple of good moments in this last one.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter in full medieval armour while the rotors hit the hull.
Atkinson &apos; s gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humour is disappointingly short and rather superfluous, especially now that franchises of 007 and Mission: Impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
The humour seems more aimed at children than adults, and for me, the absurd mishaps of Johnny English are not as clever and well-timed as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent on duty, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the final straw for the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered figure who is watching his political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives it her best shot in this role, which is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisers tell him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That must be the bumbling Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh school, although he gives informal lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy school like the one in Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old pal Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submariner wife, a role he plays well but which Vicki Pepperdine does not exploit enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of Her Majesty return to action, with the beautiful but deadly Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic multi-millionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain &apos; s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they dress up as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxury yacht of Volta; and English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta &apos; s house.
The last sequence was definitely well-executed, but the whole thing still has a rather childish feel to it.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I wondered whether the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan to make Britons work four days a week and be paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan with which Britons would work four days a week, but would be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the owners of AI companies to use the savings from the revolution to give their workers an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
Sources say the idea "fits" with the party's plans and economic agenda to tilt the country in favour of workers.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way of workers making the most of the changing economy.
As one senior Labour Party figure told The Sunday Times: "We are expecting a review of the directive before the end of the year."
"It will not be easy, but the four-day week is definitely a question that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, not all Labour Party members are in favour of this decision at the moment.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at the moment."
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was prepared to restore powers to "anonymous directors" and "well-paid" directors of public service companies.
One of the shadow minister &apos; s plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders in water companies will not get back all their money, as a Labour government might apply deductions to reflect the irregularities perceived.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10 per cent of shares in private sector companies would be allocated to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has at least delayed by a week the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court judge, and raises the question of whether the results could influence any Republican senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could produce information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
I was in favour of going ahead with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, resolute, and to the point.
Graham &apos; s vote, however, seems immovable.
He had already made up his mind about Brett Kavanaugh and would ignore the accusation.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it vehemently," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she named has been able to confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it succeeded in reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive roster of stars for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park &apos; s Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively engaged in the fight against it.
If you want a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), you have to complete a series of tasks or "actions," such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other thing that helps raise awareness about your goal to end poverty.
But what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just another form of "clicktivism", which is the name given to the position we adopt when we believe we are doing something really useful by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favour of a wide range of goals.
Through these actions, they claim to have secured commitments and policies worth over $37 billion from global leaders, which will impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had been disbursed or pledged.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly impacted almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom united by the common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, $35 million has been proposed for Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
Thanks to the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and Global Citizens partners like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition," to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also claimed that, after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions asked on its website about what we think can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and hard road, and we will stumble and fall many times along the way.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have shown, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers we will have at the New York event this year, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of Russian energy exports - Secretariat of the Interior
In case necessary," Washington could call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up markets, including the Middle East, according to the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, as reported in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is just a pretext for expansion into new markets.
He is convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the most southerly supplier of Europe.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and means of dealing with this.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that shipping lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the voice of energy consumers in the United States."
He compared the approaches Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia, he said, was basically to exploit and replace fossil fuels, while Russia could only do one thing, which was to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made as the Trump administration has been trying to push liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russian gas as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted throughout that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington &apos; s fierce opposition to the project is only economic and is yet another example of unfair competition.
"I believe we all share the idea that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The United States position, however, has met with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States not to interfere in the EU energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said: "It is a major problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will "thoroughly explore" a run for the presidency in 2020, she said.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a presentation at the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women among our leaders, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a speech at the City Hall and said that "he was taking the country down the wrong path."
He said, "I really worry about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy."
Warren spoke candidly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "It is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
A survey was published on Thursday, however, which showed that a majority of Warren voters themselves do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
A 58 per cent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said that Senator Kerry should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
A 32 per cent of those surveyed did support his candidacy.
The survey showed a greater level of support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of respondents in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other Democratic Party members spoke about the possible candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin &apos; s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
The situation that my son is going through, everything that has happened since he came back, is very well known to the other families that are suffering from the effects of TEPT and other wounds that our soldiers are coming back with, and I am talking about the families of the soldiers who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.
Palin referred to this arrest as the "big taboo nobody wants to talk about," and commented on his son and other veterans of war who "come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there is really this respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a domestic violence complaint and possession of firearms under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new US policy that denies asylum to domestic violence or gang victims.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a "friendly letter" on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker who is facing the current directive, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the "Grace v. Sessions" case, which was filed by the ACLU in August 2000 against the federal government, has not been revealed.
He said that his friend and his children, who were members of a violent gang, had abused her, but the US officials had denied her asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states, which defend Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum claims to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States revoked a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum in this country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine made statements on Friday in which he said the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum applications must be decided on the facts and circumstances of the particular claim and not on an exception to that principle, the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also argued in their brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the US economy by claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "are a necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to domestic abuse and gang violence victims in June.
Asylum seekers can be granted asylum if they leave their country of origin because of persecution or threats on account of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said when he announced this directive on 11 June.
The asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, let alone all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of dead rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, was trying to comfort her feverish baby at a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies."
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search through the few belongings that remain, in an effort to salvage what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building because of the continuing aftershocks, which were also very strong.
He could not help but cry as he told us of the violent earthquake he had experienced while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to get out of the way.
Haris told Associated Press that he had been trapped in the rubble of the fallen wall, "I think," he said.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I don &apos; t know what has happened to her and my daughter.
He said, "I hope they are well."
US Ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper by a Chinese state-run newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely circulated newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US elections on 6 November, something China denies.
Trump &apos; s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the US elections marked a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue public announcements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are now locked in a growing trade war that has led them to raise tariff levels on both sides.
The Chinese countervailing duties that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were designed to fall on exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China is "intensifying this pressure with ads in our free press."
In an effort to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and a free press to try to place an advertisement in the Des Moines Register.
"In contrast, in the newsstand on the street where we are in Beijing, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China can have about the troubling trajectory that their economy is on, since the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party."
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China had declined to publish" his article, but did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts note that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are lining up behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash could occur, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been intense, and many Republicans have expressed their desire to proceed with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, wrote in an article published on Saturday that "this is not a case where you can go back."
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake &apos; s latest attempt to position himself in favour of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm the disgruntled voters on this issue.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget tomorrow, or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters outside the Senate were chanting "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) as the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by the Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is way beyond any prediction," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
People say that the impact is already very significant, and indeed it is.
But it could be even higher, especially among indecisive women in the outer suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote, even if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford &apos; s public testimony, in which he detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had indicated that a backslide could occur if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
This has become a big problem for the Republican Party, according to Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as reported by NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or even whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench; it's also about how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they've treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know whom to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are siding with Kavanaugh.
In a new YouGov poll, 41 per cent of respondents say they believe Ford &apos; s testimony definitively or probably, while 35 per cent say they believe Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30 per cent said the same of Ford.
Following the push by Flake, the FBI is now investigating Ford &apos; s statements, as well as at least those of another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said that Kavanaugh had violated her while she was drunk at age 17.
Ramirez, for his part, claimed that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend. A company based on the open source code platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world."
He said, "It has to be now."
It is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create their own "personal data locker" or POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique to online data storage is that the user is the one who decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data."
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company &apos; s chief executive officer, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills that will enable Solid to reach everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers on staff working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers from around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether there is going to be a radical change or not where all their business models are going to be completely changed overnight."
We are not going to ask permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with Inrupt launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added, "I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web."
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant was honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren found a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "a particularly symbolic find" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the decoration.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under intense machine-gun and artillery fire" on 29 September 1918.
He then ran the line of fire and, with "the greatest courage," advanced the line before reaching a single-handed canyon and knocking out three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather &apos; s actions were "so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade and added that the value of a true hero was clear when he was shown such a large turnout.
The MMA fans stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig
Imagine that he stays up all night to watch Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event at the end.
The San José billboard featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was to be broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face off, the United Kingdom viewers were stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
One Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a big joke."
Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, told us that the content was not appropriate, so they had to change the programming to children.
"Peppa the pig", yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that they would be changing the programme to include British audiences in the next editions.
When I think of the option of live transmission, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it is at 6 a.m. on a Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, we received a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because we thought it was a technical problem at first.
But it was not a problem of the government.
I can promise you that it will not happen again.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is what we have normally done. We tried to give more than usual to the fans and we went over.
It is a very unfortunate situation," he said.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but that was what drove him to become a success.
At 24, he told us that he did not realize until he reached secondary school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that her intention in talking about gay rights was to "transmit hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to take less importance in winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this legendary programme, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first Laverne programme, Daley, who had himself been a social outcast, said that he had felt "inferior" to the rest of the children during his childhood because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," and he did not disappoint when he finally discovered his sexual identity.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a prominent face of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He told us because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to share that "hope" with others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, was also a surprise for her.
Daley married last year to an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
When you live so much from such a young age (he was 14 at his first Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone your age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "overall perspective" had changed.
If he had been asked last year, all his answers would have been about "having to win a gold medal," he said.
But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie."
His son is named Robert, after his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and indeed one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
He was unable to tell him that he would not be able to be in the front row.
He had his hand on my shoulder when he stopped breathing and it was only then that I realized that he was not invincible.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
At that point I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This was also the inspiration behind his first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him during the preparation for the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, sat out the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad statistic.
Mickelson, who was playing in the event for the 12th time in pursuit of a record, was beaten by Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the centre of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time major champion had to settle for cheering at times and, at others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what ails him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough punishes errant shots constantly.
And if the field is not sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth round on Sunday, faces the brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, had started in such impressive fashion, Mickelson &apos; s match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his colleague, who could say no more.
He understood perfectly the role he had to play today, patted me on the back and said he would be ready for tomorrow."
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that is how it came out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass the mark of Nick Faldo for most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a long line of Ryder Cups that had never been so clearly defined by his individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, but Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He said, "It's fun, sarcastic, clever, he likes to mock others; he's a great guy to have on the team."
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as a support this week; it was fun.
It is much more than just a game."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows only too well that, even with a substantial advantage in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a Seve Ballesteros-led American team held a five-point lead over the Europeans, but in the end only managed to tie the match by the narrowest of margins, 14½-13½.
Bjorn recalled, "We keep reminding you that we won a great tournament at Valderrama; we also won at Brookline and lost, we won at Valderrama and won, but by the skin of our teeth."
History will teach me and everyone else that that equipment is not finished.
You have to give it your all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This is not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal to achieve, and that is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side, where the best players in the world are."
Proud of what his players had done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is happening tomorrow is individual performances and that is different.
It is great to share what is happening with a partner when things are going well, but when things are not going well, you really test your golfing ability.
That is the message that needs to be sent to the players, to give their best tomorrow.
Now it is time to leave your partner behind and go and get the best out of yourself."
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be hoping his players can do better individually than they did as a pair, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points from four.
Furyk has been at both ends of these great tournaments in the last few days and has been part of the winning team at Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
When we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had motivated his players on the last day, he replied, "I remember every word."
We have 12 super-duper teams tomorrow, but we have to play as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure is on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
We gave Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and take on Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
Bjorn explained that he had chosen the group in that order because he felt that they covered the whole route.
The new German warship, delayed again
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era vessels, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to defective systems and the ongoing increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery scuppered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures that are very low.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the far reaches of the world) will already be out of date when they start to operate, as Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 was the subject of headlines last year when the German Navy officially rejected the ship and returned it to Blohm &amp; Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time a ship had been returned to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the returns, but German sources cited a number of "critical software and hardware malfunctions" that left the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the class Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half the crew of the old class Bremen ships.
It was also found that the ship has an excessive weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy &apos; s ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is now thought to have reached 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion), rather than the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of the German navy.
In early 2007, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy was "losing ships that can deploy."
He said that the problem had been getting worse over time, because old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new research, carried out in a Scottish Highlands state, is trying to find out how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that what is discovered will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton's bat and brown long-eared bat from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at strategic locations on the property to monitor bat activity during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The experts will analyse the sounds picked up on the recordings to find out the frequency of the calls of the bats and what species make them.
A report and map of the habitat will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
With this information, the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be managed for bats and other associated species, can be determined.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affects their nests and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and cabling can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind,
Unless they are nocturnal hunters, their ears are more useful than their eyes in finding their prey.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The National Trust, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescues.
The organisation has even opened the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
Here at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still much to be learned about bats, and the work we do here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before maintenance work is carried out on the property, as a colony of bats could be destroyed unintentionally and 400 breeding females and young could be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as to destroy their colonies.
The Scottish-born Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Wildlife Trust officer, has urged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species about which we know little about their populations."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations as "fake news" and says that people are "using his name to get attention."
His lawyers have been instructed to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
He is accused of raping a woman from the United States, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying 375,000 dollars to keep the incident quiet, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already garnered 142 million followers just hours after the news was released, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," he said, looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but I can't help it.
The player smiled and added, "I am a happy man and everything is fine."
Ronaldo &apos; s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appeared in what they called "an unacceptable report on privacy suspicions," Reuters reported.
Christian Schertz, the lawyer, said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
It seems that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player &apos; s room and there, according to the documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo allegedly raped her anally.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good kid" and that he had let him down by "one per cent."
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of reprisals" and worried about being "humiliated in public."
The woman, 34, says she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatised by the events.
When the alleged attack took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a big name in Italian football on a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: The UK will always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if we lost our position as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would temporarily stop.
Mr. Clark said, "We need an agreement."
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of customs delays in the event of a Brexit without a deal could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 per cent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production bottlenecks in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the general manager of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade; including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers are the problems that could arise at the assembly lines in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyota production line is based on the &quot; just in time &quot; (JIT) method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border, according to the sector, which could lead to delays and the shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to house the equivalent of more than a day &apos; s inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May &apos; s Chequers plan, which sets out the future relationship with the EU, was "tuned precisely to avoid these border checks".
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will not only see us through this moment but will allow us to take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
The evidence from Toyota and many other manufacturers is that we have to be able to continue with what has been a tremendously successful supply chain to date.
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production will be halted, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite shop steward there, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "My experience is that once those jobs are lost, they are never recovered."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a clear and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be delayed again, White House says
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, could be delayed for another week, as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, links between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump might fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus compromise the independence of Mueller, has fuelled gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein secretly recorded his conversations with Trump and wore a microphone to try to get him removed under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied that.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, where there were reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not to" fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the full Senate vote.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court."
We will decide on the spot and I will inform the press as usual."
Some journalists would dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the lack of press facilities was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who acted grandiloquently, although he said, "I wouldn't disagree with the fact that they do."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The president holds more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him, he said, citing an unsourced quote: "We have compared those numbers."
Press briefings will continue, he said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly the President of the United States, I think that is much better than asking me."
We have tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press briefings with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
Indeed, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why that was so, where he made an unannounced and sometimes bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish Government Health Secretary writes to NHS Scotland staff about their fears over Brexit
The Scottish Government Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in the Scottish HSC to express the gratitude of the country and its wish for them to continue working with them post-Brexit.
Just six months before the UK left the EU, MSP Jeane Freeman sent a letter.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens working in non-central government services.
In her letter, she wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit option that was expected this autumn continued."
However, the United Kingdom government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know that all this must be very confusing for you.
And that is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each and every member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
EU and other professionals bring valuable experience and skills to the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to have you with us."
Christion Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head wound.
Christion Abercrombie, a player on the Tennessee State Tigers, was treated for a head injury in an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told the media that the injury occurred just before the break.
Reed said, "It came down and just collapsed there."
Both trainers and medical personnel administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for a thorough examination.
A member of the staff at the Tennessee State Hospital told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details yet on the type of injury or the extent of the damage" and the Tennessee State was trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding a total of 18 for the season.
Foreigners will pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to provide shelter for the homeless, according to new plans by the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn &apos; s offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the land transaction tax will be applied to those who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year, which will be used to help the homeless.
The additional money raised from the increase in stamp duty on foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralise the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises of providing more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to target those with higher incomes.
The increase in the land tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom and the money will be used to incentivise the government to tackle the problem of begging on the streets.
The levy, which is a supplement to the current stamp duty, including the increase in rates on second-hand homes introduced two years ago, could reach up to 3 per cent.
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not reside in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's most affluent areas (especially the capital) have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping property prices very high by buying up land without any intention of using it, and urged Mrs May to abolish the affordable housing quotas to solve the "shameful" housing problem in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a very attractive series of reforms for housing, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
He also proposes giving local authorities more power to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream of improving the life chances of every new generation.
And that means dealing with the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, should be able to buy homes more easily than British working people.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the streets is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become a coach in Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited at the prospect of reviving the club in the north-east, which currently occupies third place in the League One (third tier of English football), three points behind the leaders.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only managed to get a B hat, he told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father, and it has always been something that has made me want to go back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I can successfully run a club."
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when he went to such established names in such a big club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, my success is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club are certainly Premier League standard," he said.
It is not easy to get, but I would only consider myself successful here if I could return the club to where it belongs."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell in the Hearts technical department.
He helped Alloa recover from the drop to the third division and helped St. Mirren go from being on the brink of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever before during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled, "It was probably a real crossroads when I took over Alloa."
I always thought that I was better at directing than playing.
It may sound strange, but it was good, I could make a living from it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work, but I feel good in my job.
I always wanted to train and now I have, it is the time of my adult life when I have felt better, no doubt."
You can hear the full interview on Sportsound on Monday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted profits at British pubs struggling to survive, but all the pressure has been on the chains.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA, which compiled the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have kept July on the same pattern as June, when pubs increased their takings by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8 per cent fall in restaurant trade in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly serve drinks had their strongest month, compared with most restaurants, where they reduced their profits.
The pubs that mainly serve meals also suffered, although not as badly as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to go out to drink.
Sales of drinks in managed bars and pubs rose by 6.6 per cent during the month, while sales of meals fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, of the hospitality and leisure analysts at RSM said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April."
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of sales in the home-based activities market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8 per cent fall in sales compared with last year is going to be particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food industry and the weather will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in the number of new brands.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, data from 47 operational groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion is collated and analysed, and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media sites, behind their parents' backs
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret accounts on social media sites that their parents and teachers are unaware of, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted among 20,000 secondary school students, revealed an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages.
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit material will be published
20% of the students said they had a "main" account that they showed to their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) have created secret social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears of the publication of sexual content.
One in five students said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents, while having other private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter was horrified to see a teenager encouraging others to "violate" her.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many young people feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on both track and field and his president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want to see sport benefit from his great international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish, UK and worldwide athletics community, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from having her in its leadership," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics between the four golds he won and now is a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack, which left him temporarily unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I have recovered fully and I am now doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your messages and words of encouragement!
The announcement of the "breast pump" where mothers are compared to cows has divided opinion on the Internet
A breast-feeding company has divided opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing mothers who breast-feed with cows that are being milked.
To mark the launch of what the company calls the "world's first silent breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with a bit of ironic music showing mothers talking about the freedom they get from the new breast pump.
Four real women dance in a hay barn, with cows, to the tune of "Yes, I order myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, these aren't udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Feed them, feed them, I am feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I am feeding my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company &apos; s Facebook page, has caused a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it focuses on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
A very unfortunate decision to use cows to announce this product.
As with us, they have to be pregnant before they can produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them shortly after birth, wrote one person.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly incorporated into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby."
But why not use them to announce a breast-milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a wild announcement."
Others, however, defended the announcement, including a woman who admitted that the song was "distasteful."
I think that is a great idea.
If he were still nursing, he would have one.
When I used the pump, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit over the top, but I don't give it any more thought.
One woman told us, "It's a great product."
Another person commented: "It is a funny announcement for mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows."
The dairy industry is not praised or criticized in the announcement.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside their brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who express milk with a pump feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the breast-pump bra, allowing its users to move around, hold their babies and even go out into the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, a Mother partner and ECD, comments: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch."
Showing the parallel between expressive women and lactating cows was intended to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and personal way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied immigrant minors discreetly relocated to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied minors detained has increased significantly, despite the fact that monthly inflow at the border has remained at the usual levels. In part, this is due to the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are making it difficult to place these children.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be required to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal records.
Around 80 per cent of sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we are still pursuing these people," said Albence.
In their haste to process juveniles more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from the date of arrest, rather than 60 days, as the previous standard, according to workers at the reception centres.
Many will testify by videoconference rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered fit for the protection will be deported as soon as possible.
According to workers at the reception centres and reports from the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they are held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Concerns are even greater at larger facilities, such as at Tornillo, where it is more likely that the signs of distress in these children will be overlooked.
Furthermore, the transfer to the camp without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause trauma to many who are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country's war has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the vice-prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue would be "dealt with accordingly."
He told the assembly, "They must be removed immediately and unconditionally."
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any foreign illegal presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that made them decide to stay outside the country.
He said, "We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns."
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel bastion of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will be "eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy, is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee, arguing that the panel &quot; should be restricted to reviewing the articles of the current constitution &quot; and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will doubtless hope, a premature impeachment or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!"
There are no signs of fatigue among the spectators at the moment.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC have doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million for prime time.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in its peak audience, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has surpassed cable news channels with 3.5 million viewers for its top news programs.
“It is an odd attraction that we still don’t understand,” says Neal Baer, the show’s executive producer, “Designated Survivor,” a dramatic ABC series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?
"Because it makes me laugh," was the reply.
Chaos is always in the entertainment business.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of families of immigrants being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
But the information overloads you when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear," the $15,000 ostrich skin jacket of Paul Manafort ("a piece of over-the-top vanity," in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As for me, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it is partly what makes everything seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars,” when he talks about the alternating Trump and his daily plot twists (whether it be going into a fight with the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside his house watching MSNBC and CNN at the same time.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
Fleiss recalls, "I remember when we used to do all those crazy things with our programmes and people used to say that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows into the midterm election of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the money is flowing into the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a district in the Congress with two candidates seeking re-election to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, which has recently been redesigned, is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another Republican challenger, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding battle between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Campaign Committee (DNCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name of Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political experts have given the Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed down
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight Washington-led rejection.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Organization Trump evicted the management team.
The State Department officials decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for Central America and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, the United States and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials in the administration made it clear that their intention was that the conference should go ahead, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, which diplomats see as a sign of the importance the administration has placed on the meeting.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or reprisals from Washington.
A spokesman for White House National Security Council chief John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which is already well documented in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also looking into the possibility that Trump &apos; s campaign was working in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable by that chamber, just as he is preparing to run again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and I am not suggesting that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his European equivalents.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All they needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world has turned on these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy has accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans now face several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in good form since this paper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his unfitness for office.
Rosenstein says that The Times explanation is not quite right.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will be facing a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador &apos; s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the start of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the team can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
We got a good result, as Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing we could do something and ended up with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall the draw was perhaps a fair result.
We were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve all three points, but it will be a tough game because they have already achieved a good result in the previous game. But with all the support from the crowd, I am sure we can achieve a positive result.
Last year was a tough one for me and the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be all right.
The equipment is in good shape, the boys are having a great time and we are getting a good workout.
I hope we can move forward, leave last year behind and achieve success."
The fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night
Despite the fact that the survey respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their families.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they spoke to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a relative, but they are not taking the steps to have this conversation, says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options can be a determining factor in cost.
Include your financial adviser in the conversion, as he may also be able to help you find a way to pay for it.
Their long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover costs or to insure themselves with their own savings, if they have the money.
Negotiate your legal papers: get ahead of the legal battles.
Ensure that you have a power of attorney to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and to ensure that the professionals do what you would want in the event that you are unable to communicate.
It can also prepare a notarial power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don &apos; t forget the small details: imagine your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.

Shots fired at man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They have shot at a man with a rifle several times as he was walking home after leaving the house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (BST), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications blocked, the relief workers have been unable to get any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency extends for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the northwestern coast of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is a lower-level administrative region, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of great seismic activity, and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of fatalities occurred on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast, with almost 700 fatalities.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 killer earthquake and tsunami.
This time, it did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) was hit by a series of large earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the island &apos; s northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin &apos; s eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a police report issued Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from him.
KTUU reported that Palin was being held at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and was being held without bail on a $500,000 bond.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he was declared "absolutely innocent" when asked to make a statement, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a lesser Class B offence, with a sentence of one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska veterans court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime and being drunk in possession of a weapon in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son &apos; s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The power and communications networks have collapsed and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just to the side of the Sulawesi centre, which is located to the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bike attack on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan last October, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
To justify a death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injury, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the document.
Several weeks later, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to the prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the notice of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York has prosecuted a death penalty case.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
The police said that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the flag of ISIS to be flown in his hospital room, said the police.
He has been acquitted of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said, "Obviously, they are disappointed with the decision of the prosecution."
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea with a life sentence without parole, without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” said Patton.
The defence team for Saipov had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised "to mobilise the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May &apos; s MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK "would have left" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Theresa May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more by a group of Tories in favour of remaining who have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers deal on its feet in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force Euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and "chaos".
Leave Means Leave MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject Chequers.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
He dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
Pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also there, and told reporters: "I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people."
The public at large does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the audience that "we need to make the politicians feel the heat" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
It is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat."
“We are going to mobilise the people &apos; s army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the pro-democracy demonstrators had marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards reading "Tories Against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for the security problems they had with an application of the party during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing to be considered a good Brexit”, he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for the presidency
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump &apos; s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been much speculation about the possibility of Warren facing off against Trump in 2020.
His Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 30th town hall meeting since Trump took office, using the town hall format.
A colleague asked him if he was planning to stand for the presidency.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our "irregular government" and that includes a woman at the top.
One arrested in the shooting death of LSU football player Sims
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, early on Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interview, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-metre-tall player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the orders from the Mercedes team would play a key role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of the picture by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to go into the pits and let Hamilton run in his slipstream, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strongly on the next lap and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a wheel-to-wheel move that left the Ferrari driver having to give up the inside line at risk of being passed on the next corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 on the day, started from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first lap.
He led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally made it into the pits on lap 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to recover fourth place from Raikkonen.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman by letting me go ahead.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect pair," said Hamilton.
That was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia, the president did not mention directly the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were "bad, repugnant and false people."
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false,” he said.
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say "But I didn't do it."
I did not do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember his response... "You filtered the document?" - "Oh, oh, what?"
No.
I did not leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
Have we filtered it? No, we haven &apos; t filtered it,” he replied, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the leak was reported in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
Feinstein told the committee, "I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story," according to The Hill.
He said, "She asked me to keep it confidential and I did."
But his refusal did not sit well with the president, who during his Saturday night speech commented, "I will tell you something: that was some bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen."
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don &apos; t care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get the power and the control,” said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the damage on Friday by beating Belfast Giants 5-3 in the Elite League on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead of two goals thanks to the attacking play of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie had earlier tied the local derby before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
François Bouchard had an equaliser for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe &apos; s men, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams, of which the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what could be considered an early, lively period, Sullivan put the local team in the mood to play with a goal in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt tied the game with Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the score with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and secured the victory with his team &apos; s fifth goal as the game drew to a close.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
A traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape in the earthquake plane
An air traffic controller from Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after dying in the line of duty to ensure a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people died and many are still missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to rock the area, and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, where the tower was being badly shaken.
He ensured that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, told ABC News that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
He added, "Our hearts break when we hear this."
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of victims is expected to rise, as many bodies were still under the rubble and many people could not be contacted,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Tsunamis that reached six metres high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies."
Clean water is scarce.
“Mini-markets are being looted everywhere,” he said.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible to the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country &apos; s military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
CNN reported that the United States was ready.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in the early part of this year, with more than 550 people killed in the Lombok quakes.
Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after the air accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says one man is missing, after saying that 47 passengers and the crew had escaped safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening, there had been no sign of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane came in very low.
Jaynes said, "That is extremely good."
Jaynes comments that he and other passengers were able to wade through water up to their waists to the emergency exits of the plane which was beginning to sink.
He said that the passengers panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that sailors working on nearby dock improvements also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the aviation safety network indicate that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive is presented by an analyst.
The prosecution concluded its arguments on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The Department of Justice &apos; s Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to tie the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data for several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Chambers &apos; mobile phone had been with Sanford &apos; s phone for the time Chambers said he was with Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Sanford was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck with Tellis that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records showed that they had been known only a week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers &apos; s death, Tellis deleted Chambers &apos; s messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "It wiped her out."
The defence is due to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be handed over to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and social commentary.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Acts such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for "racist" text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black woman."
The couple deny that it is racist and compare the demand to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her shock at discovering that the new child carer, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband, "NOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON."
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "discomfited" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that she was expecting a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received his day &apos; s pay and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for wrongful dismissal with an award of $350 per day for the six months of internal work for which she had been hired, but without a contract.
He told The Post on Friday, "I want to show them that things are not done like that," and added, "I know it is a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice &apos; s employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they would not be able to trust him after having offended him.
My wife had sent him something he didn &apos; t want to say.
She is not racist.
Joel Plasco, the husband of the victim, told the Post, "We are not racists."
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you had been rude, even if it was an accident?
To your newborn?
“Come on!”
Comparing the demand as "extortion," Plasco said his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to go for someone like that?"
That is not a very decent thing to do,” said the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still pending, the couple has been denounced by the public opinion on social media, with comments criticizing their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealed a new map
Bond &apos; s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the map: "It was hard to imagine someone reading it for the first time before publication."
It is very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the children &apos; s book, had hoped his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was &quot; bittersweet &quot; after his father &apos; s death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very quiet man who did not like to boast.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if he had a child who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, even though it was not really your achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although he was its creator and its product, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
As he landed, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said that her husband called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to succeed.
I then received a call from Nad to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said to him, "Tashi, I love you very much, darling."
I will be with you shortly.
I will be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were slowly wearing out and leaving his system.
She had died too soon and everything was going out.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not howl, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was about to undergo.
"Nobody knew," he said.
I bent my head and the tears were falling all the time.
It is hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much she loved him.
Women in mourning put up suicide prevention cards
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
He said, "I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day."
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any place.
However, he left his job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler &apos; s 11-year-old brother found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried about the impact."
Davis created the cards "so people know that there are people to go to and talk to, even if it is a friend."
You don &apos; t have to be quiet, you have to talk about it.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
He says, "He didn't say he was depressed or anything like that."
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in their attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to get over it: "It leaves a big hole in the family."
It has left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought if we could really get something like what he was asking for (a limited time, a limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going off the rails” in the midst of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican backers not want the FBI investigation to proceed?
Their refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
There are only five weeks to go to the mid-term elections on 6 November, and if the Republicans do badly, their efforts to elect the man they want for the Supreme Court will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President &apos; s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The figures for North Korean desertions "fall" with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
He said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by people-smugglers, had been the key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment on the matter.
Most of the deserters from the north eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on United States sanctions.
Without the trust of the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm, Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "outrageous" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said that Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee to the Supreme Court, was a "histrionic" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used his emotion to deny the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking as he spoke of his family and his years of secondary education.
He also condemned explicitly the Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by angry liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
He said, "I think he has disqualified himself with those statements and the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats."
Pelosi objected when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House.
She said, "I will say one thing: if he is lying to the Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he is not fit to be on the court he is on now."
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, which is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said, "This is not the time for a hysterical, impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine."
And women have to take it up.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury spilling out, and she cannot let go without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's all that unusual, do you?"
He continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was talking: "Perhaps you think I am crying because I am angry."
No, I am not angry.”
And then he went back to what he was doing.
He thought it was "great."
Crying is allowed as a way out of anger partly because it is not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once when I found myself in tears with an unexpressed rage. An older, serious woman manager, whom I had always been slightly afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
He told me, "Don't let anyone ever see you cry."
You have no idea how angry I am.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business, a boat named after the affair, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea of her own candidacy.
"It was not a well-considered decision," he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they did not need another one.
Someone referred to us as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
As the campaign was already well under way, he fell behind in fund-raising, and promised that he would not enter the race again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do you think I get a discount?" he asked.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotion (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made fundraising difficult and focused on capturing votes rather than delegates, and anger at sexism) that she choked.
"It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled the reaction of the press.
You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to put on my tombstone?"
“Did you 'cry'?”
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still a long way to go before the battle is over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning in early 2018 by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant climb took place this week with new tariffs that affect $200 billion (£150 billion) in goods, which will tax half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently applying tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pledged to match the United States, and it is unlikely that the second-largest economy in the world will soon back down.
To back down would be to concede to Washington, but to publicly submit to the United States would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, the experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the war of trade between the United States and China could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a crash landing in the economy in either country is actually much more dangerous than the audience has recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, an associate fellow at the Center for New American Security focused on Asia.
Syria ready to welcome back refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
The situation on the ground is today more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The government is still trying to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are still six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had promoted the insurgency.
Ryder Cup goes to Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last victory in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish team of Thomas Bjorn won the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight most of the way through the tournament, hit his tee shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, admitting defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever go 5-0-0 in the current format of the tournament, which began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio García, who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European player with the most points in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
I don &apos; t usually cry, but today I can &apos; t help it.
It has been a very hard year.
I am most grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to retrieve the cup.
It was a team effort and I am very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team won.
Now it is the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a singles match on Sunday.
I feel an incredible sense of pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching this man play golf," said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is an odd statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, leaving him only one behind Jack Nicklaus.
The US team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf all week.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team &apos; s disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting."
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we spoil it.
I would like to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Their 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now we must bow our heads.
They have "out-done" us."
