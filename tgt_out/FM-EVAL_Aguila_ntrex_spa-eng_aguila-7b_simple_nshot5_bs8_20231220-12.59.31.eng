Members of the Welsh Assembly (AMs) worry about “looking like muppets”
Some members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, by its English name).
This disarray arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of all political spectrums are concerned that this might be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party in the House of Assembly declared that the word “rime” with “Twp” and “Pwp” was “too rime”.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that the whole group was “dissatisfied” and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was open to changing the name, but noted that the change of pronunciation was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is like the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change, declares: “By definition, the decision on any descriptive element of the membership of the Assembly will be the matter of the members themselves”.
The 2017 Welsh Assembly Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that revealed a broad support for calling the Assembly's parliament.
On the question of the title of the Assembly Members, the Commission chose Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option won the majority of the support in a public consultation.
The Assembly members are suggesting alternative options, but the fight for consensus could lead to a stalemate for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the bill regarding the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on inhabilitation of Assembly Members and the design of committees.
The members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of how they should be called when they deliberate on legislation.
The Macedonians cast ballots in a referendum on changing the country's name.
The Macedonians are voting on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to “Republic of Macedonia”.
The vote was called to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has consistently insisted on the name of its northern neighbor's name being a claim of its territory and in multiple occasions has opposed its membership in the European Union and the NATO.
The president of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is merely a price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church in Harlem ring silently because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem.
“Historically, people who have spoken to me say there was a bar and a church in every corner.”
“Today, there is no such thing as a perfect world.
The disappearance of bars was understandable.
Now people socialize in a different way.
The bars are no longer the hubs of the neighborhood.
Concerns about the churches' finances is that the money earned from the sale of goods won't last as long as the leaders expect and that “before or after, they will return to the point of departure”.
Churches, he said, could be replaced by apartments full of the type of people who won't help the shrines that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, and, therefore, accelerate the closing of these churches, since it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches.
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in 1880.
The white Methodist Church was formed in the early 19th century.
A black congregation that had been holding services in the building acquired it.
A congregation of blacks took over the reins of San Martín, under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the street 125, a main shopping street in Harlem, that resisted or refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while the congregation of the Father Johnson Church were making plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of the Father Johnson in San Martin, called it the “campaign of the poor”.
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it a “cultural treasure” and “a historical instrument that cannot be replaced”.
The carillon is the largest in the world, and it is played by a black musician.
The man who was to lead the Argentine army to victory in the War of Independence, General San Martín, did not replace the original flag.
What has happened in San Martín in the last months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the parish's governing body, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "wanted to pass the costs" on to the board, although this had not happened.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark attacks a 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters on Saturday in California's first day of the langosta season, officials said.
The attack occurred around 7 am near Encinitas Beach.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends were diving with friends when they heard the child begging for help, so they went to the rescue.
Hammel said he was initially excited to have captured a lobster, but then realized he was screaming that he had been bitten.
He had a broken clavicle.
“I shouted to all to get out of the water because there was a shark.”
The child was flown by helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard, Larry Giles, said a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered dangerous.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to the beach Swami, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for safety reasons.
There are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand its beauty business in the US and Europe.
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff in the department stores' aisles.
To boost the UK beauty market, which is valued at 2800 billion pounds and is growing faster than the fashion and home appliances markets, the beauty hallways will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country and, if they pass, the same format will be repeated in more stores the following year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that was formerly used for televisions, microwaves, and kitchenware.
Sainsbury's announced that it would double its beauty offering with up to 3000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The new concept will also include a new menu, with a new menu.
The chain also plans to launch a new line of makeup that is more eco-friendly.
The Fragrance Shop will also be opening a store in Croydon, South London, the first new store in the chain in the south of England in the year.
The online shopping and the shift to daily small amounts of food in local stores force grocery chains to make a concerted effort to convince customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury's CEO, has said that stores will look more like shopping centers as the chain tries to combat the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products than just food.
Sainsbury's has integrated discounts of Argos in hundreds of stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago.

Spanish: 
The previous attempt by the chain to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute over how to split the profits of pharmaceutical products in their supermarkets.
The new strategy is after the sale of the 281 pharmacy stores of Sainsbury's to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds will be participating in the plan, adding a wider range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Sainsbury's Director of Commercial said: “We have transformed the appearance and the environment of our beauty department to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized team of trained personnel who will be available to offer advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to fit all needs.
Peter Jones is “furious” after Holly Willoughby breaks a deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, was “furious” after Holly Willoughby broke a deal of 11 million pounds with his business line of lifestyle for focusing on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the fashion and accessories brand Truly.
This business had compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The host of This Morning, of 37, announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, by leaving her lucrative lifestyle in the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources consulted, Jones was “furious” when the gold girl of television admitted that her new deals, valued at up to £1.5 million, did not leave time for Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, to devote herself to it during a tensa meeting held on Tuesday at her Buckinghamshire headquarters.
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double the fortune of Willoughby, which was around 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to his holiday home.
He was the most important person in the world.
It was expected that the company would be acquired by a larger company.
His decision to quit left all involved totally stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise in the headquarters of Marlow, ready to be put on sale.
The experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment in products such as coffins, and, potentially, delaying its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been together for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is going to be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that “no business was discussed”.
A difficult conversation, and then we fell in love.
I was making a joke about the criticism I get from the media for making a comment that some people would consider “poco presidencial” and for being so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump resigned from so many things?
Trump commented with his voice sarcastically as a news anchor.
“I haven’t given up on anything”.
Trump is interested in meeting with Kim again after he praised him for his first meeting in June in Singapore, which he said was a great step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
Negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the principal diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the leaders of the world assembled in the United Nations General Assembly that his country does not see a “response appropriate” from the United States to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
The United States has been applying sanctions to keep the pressure on the Cuban government.
Trump's speech was much more optimistic than his previous one.
“We have a great relationship with North Korea.”
“We were going to enter into war with North Korea.
There would have been millions of deaths.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with North Korea have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, help for the release of American hostages, and the return of American soldiers' remains.
He also defended his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but that’s not how it’s supposed to be.
A tsunami and a major earthquake in Indonesia devastate a island, leaving hundreds dead.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign aid organizations were reported to have been told their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok had to flee, it was not declared an emergency, a requirement to trigger international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have left it very clear that they do not request international assistance, which makes it a little bit more difficult to get things done.”
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will be sent to Palu, they still don't know if the foreign staff can work on the ground.
The Sutopo spokesman said the situation in Palu was being evaluated to see if international aid could be provided.
Indonesia is a country that is constantly shaken by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, there aren't many in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of warning sirens for a tsunami in Palu, even though there was an earlier warning, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of the cases, traveling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate logistics even more.
A hospital ship is heading to Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake, but it will take at least three days to reach Palu.
The president Joko Widodo turned the improvement of the worn-out infrastructure of Indonesia into the central part of his campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is running for reelection in the next year.
In addition, he must also deal with the persistent tensions of Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim faith have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1000 people died and hundreds of thousands had to flee their homes while Christian and Muslim bands fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
This is the first time in Premier League history that a goalkeeper has scored a goal.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to about 27 metres from the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before shooting it to the second goal.
The action sent him over the area and sent him into the corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a leap and fell in the net.
“I was trying to get in that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play a lot of football up front, so I tried to give them all the time I could get.
“I saw Kante coming and I threw a pass. I didn’t think too much, just threw the ball.”
Chelsea was leading 1-0 at halftime after Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The midfielder made a pass to Mateo Kovacic, who spun and then made a run into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic passed the ball quickly and ran into the middle of the field.
After, he made a beautiful pass to Hazard in the box that took him to the box.
Hazard was sitting in front of the defense and kicked the ball into the net from the right side of the penalty box with a right foot kick that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, couldn't stop.
The match will be played on Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool plays against Napoli in the Champions League group stage.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the Indonesian Red Cross.
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of the buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and that produced waves of up to six metres, according to the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the remains of the buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as suspected murder suspect after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, in Merseyside, this morning.
The woman of 44 years was found with a knife in Grayson Mews, in John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder.
The police have asked people in the area to contact them if they have seen anything.
The Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was near John Street, in Birkenhead, and has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.”
I would also recommend to anyone, especially tax drivers, that they have captured something on camera that they can contact us with, as we can have vital information for our investigation.
A woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and was found in the interior of a property.
This afternoon some people who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to know where she had been this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but the police say nobody can enter or leave the building.
He was perplexed when he discovered what had happened.
Now, residents are allowed to enter again tomorrow.
Somebody heard a man tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
It's terrible.
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one outside.
A number of agents were still standing outside the block of flats controlled the block of flats.

The statue of Cromwell in Parliament Square is the latest in a long line of monuments to the British military hero.
The banning of the burqa would be a just act of poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by fanatical followers of the puritanical fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestions of the Crick family as a “madness” and a “mad experiment”.
In the debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that taking down the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become an objective.
The iconoclastic wars of the English Civil War were not ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice the wrong Cromwell, Thomas, during the century before.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the nineteenth century and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider deserving of celebration.
As a result, many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than now, a defender of parliament against external pressure, clearly, the monarchy.
If it is a completely accurate description, then it is a historical debate.
The conflict of the mid-17th century has given shape to our later development, and Cromwell is a figure recognizable that represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy to be celebrated and commemorated.
A pig killer attacks a Chinese farmer.
A pig attacked and killed a dairy farmer in a market in the southwest of China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a cut artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in the market of Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, as the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
The 30th of May, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm in Xining, in the province of Qinghai (China).
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at a market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and discovered the door to a pigsty was open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a great pig with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the hog had attacked the farmer until his death, according to the report.
“His legs were bloody and splintered,” said the Wu family member, “and he was sent to the hospital.”
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour after.
The animal that killed the man was not a member of either man's family.
A manager of the market reported to The Evening News that the pig was kept in a cage to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence at the scene.
It seems that the family of Yuan and the market authorities are negotiating a settlement for his death.
Although they are rare, there have been a few instances of pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man injured.
Ten years before, a hog of nearly 295 kg (630 lbs) trapped a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After a 2012 incident in which a herd of pigs ate a farmer in Oregon, a farmer from Manitoba declared to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive, but the blood of the slaughtered animals can act as a “trigger”.
“They’re just playing.”
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to do harm.
What we need to do is respect them appropriately.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will drop heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States.
As Rosa weakened, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico's north coast.
However, Rosa will drop torrential rainfall across the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next days.
Rosa caused winds of 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, from Sunday at 5:00 am (Eastern time) and was located about 620 km (370 mi) southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move northward on Sunday.
While southeast of the Pacific Ocean are starting to form low pressure, which is moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa moves closer to Baja California, a tropical storm will start to push the intense tropical rains in the direction of northwest United States.
Rain will drop more than 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical storm brings the low pressure that is approaching, there will be strong tropical rainfall across the southwest.
Local rainfall between 2 and 10 inches will cause localized flooding, mudslides, landslides, and possible landslides.
The intense tropical rains will cause heavy rainfall of between 5 and 8 cm per hour in specific areas, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
The weather forecast for the next few days is for a warm, sunny day with a chance of some rain.
Because of the scattered nature of tropical rainfall, it is possible that flash flooding may occur with rapidly changing conditions.
By this threat of torrential tropical rains, it is absolutely advised not to venture into the desert on foot.
The strong rains could turn canyons into rivers and the strong winds will cause torrential rainfall and dust storms.
The low pressure system that is expected to move through the Southwestern United States and the Southwestern United States will bring heavy rains to parts of the Southwestern United States.
Moderate to heavy rainfall can cause small flooding, which could cause mudslides and make roads slippery.
The first heavy rains of the season are expected to hit the area on Sunday.
Some tropical showers may scatter across Arizona on Sunday and Monday, before a more generalized rainband brings the weather to a close on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The strong rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and through the entire Wednesday.
In October, we can expect some intense changes in temperature in the United States because of the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
At times, this means dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
A good example of these differences in temperature is what will happen in the center of the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of nearly 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and, Omaha, and between St. Louis and Des Moines.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will gradually wane and return to normal.
In a large part of the central and eastern United States, a warm start is expected, with temperatures ranging from 26 °C to 30 °C (79 °F to 86 °F) from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
The Tuesday, in New York City could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees, 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high chances of temperatures above the average for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the confirmation hearing of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people tuned in to hear the shocking testimonies that Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault in the 1980s, gave on four television networks.
While the politics continued to be deadlocked and the media interrupted their usual programming to retransmit the latest Friday's news: a designated agreement by Senator Jeff Blake of Arizona to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh tried to strip her down in a high school party and that he tried to remove her clothes in a party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely sure that it had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the game on television.
The company counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Plus, Nielsen often has trouble estimating how many people watch something in the office.
For comparison, it's a similar audience to a football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have supported Kavanaugh's confirmation, was the number one cable news network, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long hearing that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC placed second, with 3,26 million viewers.
The three major networks each had 3,1 million viewers.
After the hearing, there was still a lot of interest.
Flake was the central character in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement informing that they would vote for Kavanaugh, the morning of Friday, the cameras of CNN and the CBS captured how protesters shouted at him when he tried to climb into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
While being interviewed on CNN, he was subjected to a barrage of criticism.
“Lookin’ at me,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?”
You have power when there are many women who don't have it.
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator closed, he would be giving more details in his testimony before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
The cable and broadcast television networks were streaming everything live hours later, when the Senate Judiciary Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the next week, which had been requested by some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part by conversations he had with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake took his decision.
The decision was fundamental, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
The president Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
The first minister Theresa May accuses critics of “making political” with Brexit.
The first minister Theresa May accused critics with her plan to leave the European Union of “doing politics” with the future of Britain and of undermining the country’s national interest in an interview with Sunday Times.
The first British PM to arrive at the Conservative Party conference is Theresa May, who arrives in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published with his cover in the front of the paper, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for the UK to leave the EU, saying that a proposal for the other to charge the UK with the EU's tariffs was “totally absurd”.
As the murder of Wayde: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in the death of LSU player.
The police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for a charge of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a public video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses in the scene of the crime and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a sister station of the CBS.
After interrogating Simpson, police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
The court has established a $350,000 bond, according to the defense.
The district court judge in Baton Rouge Este district court published a preliminary report indicating that the cause of death had been a gunshot wound to the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the criminalistics lab of the Louisiana State Police, the police department of the Southern University and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's Director of Athletics, appreciated the police's diligence and search for justice.
Simpson was 20 years old.
The player, who was more than two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had a 5.6 average and 2.6 rebounds in a last season's game.
The morning of Friday, Will Wade, LSU's basketball coach, said his team was “devastated” and “shocked” by Wayde's death.
“These are the things that always worries people”, said Wade.
A volcano in Mexico City is erupting ash.
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has been blown into the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after it showed activity and released 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The earthquake center recorded several earthquakes and earthquakes.
In the social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City's busy traffic.
The volcanologists have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 km south of Mexico City, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo”, is active since 1994.
The police are confronted with separatist Catalans before the anniversary of the independence referendum.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona after anti-independence protesters clashed with police.
A group of separatists who had been blocking the road were beaten up by police, who had been using tear gas and rubber bullets to clear the way for tourists.
There were also violent clashes in the afternoon and police used batons to control the fight.
During several hours, the separatist groups, with messages like “never forgive nor forgiven”, confronted unionist groups at the cry of “Viva España”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local news outlets.
The tensions still remain high in this region one year after the illegal vote of October 1, considered unlawful by Madrid, but celebrated by separatists.
The voters chose to be independent, although the turnout was low, as those who were against secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the vote in tables in all of Catalonia, where violent confrontations broke out.
Independentist groups camped overnight to prevent a pro-police rally.
The demonstration continued on, but took a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was at the separatist protest said he had no hope of Catalonia's independence.
The year before we had one of our best years.
I saw my parents cry of joy to be able to vote, but now we're stuck.
Although the pro-independence parties achieved a narrow victory in the regional elections of December, they have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, including former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, are in exile or are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
The tension is getting more tense.
The leader of the separatist Catalan independence movement, Oriol Junqueras, is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday to face charges of sedition and rebellion.
“Being a candidate for the European Parliament is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government.”

A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston secured the victory.
Un Livingston promoted impressed Gerrard in his 18th game as manager of the Ibrox club.
The attack of Dolly Menga marked the difference. The Americans jumped ahead, with Hibernian in second place.
This season, the Reds have yet to win any away games and the next Sunday they play at Tynecastle, leaders of the table with eight points ahead.
Before, the Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
While the Lions are still in the hunt for a playoff spot, the Livingston has extended its winning streak to six games.
Livingston gives up opportunities in front of a powerful opponent.
The team of Holt had to have gone ahead a lot earlier than they did, causing a lot of problems to the Rangers by their direct play.
Scott Robinson overcame the defense, but his shot went wide of the goal. After, Alan Lithgow missed the crossbar after a run by Craig Halkett.
The home team was content to let the visitors play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble with free kicks.
So it was as the game was tied at 1-1, the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at 1-1, and the game was tied at
The Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston looked for a way to get into the box, with a combined run, Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who hit the ball and scored from the edge of the area.
In that moment, the Rangers were in control of the ball, but they couldn't break the defense of the host, and the goalie, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Allan McGregor, goalie of the Rangers denied a shot by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow was far away from another one.
In the area of Livingston, passes were constantly being made, but always were cleared.
“Fantastic” of the Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the stadium Tony Macaroni.
A great and remarkable performance by the Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they did a great job of making a game that followed the expectations of a rising trajectory.
His style of play and his team's roster hasn't changed much since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt's recruitment of players from the team's previous squad.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was enormously effective and directed a magnificently organized defense, while Joe Worrall and Connor Goldson kept Connor McDavid and Joe Worrall alert all the time.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good moments with Gerrard, they were short.
They didn't materialize the chances, as they only managed to get into the opponent's camp once, which is a good warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received a mixed reception in Colonia.
The 29th of September, there were smiles and a blue sky during breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of the controversial visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring the alliance between NATO allies.
The discussion has focused on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After the speech, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city welcomes the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police said security concerns were the reason for the ban on a rally in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered outside to see their president.
The protesters also chanted slogans against Erdogan, who has been accused of crushing the Kurdish people and of trying to establish a one-party state in Turkey.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive impact of this visitor, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.

Long Lartin Prison: six injured after disturbance.
Six prison officials have been injured in a prison for high-security men, according to the prison's director.
The riots started in the prison of Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, at 9:30 on Sunday and still continue.
A special team of elite (called “Tornado”) is handling the riots, in which eight inmates are involved and that affects a prison.
The agents received assistance for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman says: “We have deployed specialized prisoners to handle the incident at the prison of Long Lartin.
Six members of the crew have received medical attention for injuries.
In our prisons there is no violence and we leave it clear that the perpetrators will be brought to justice and could spend more time in jail.
Long Lartin Prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a prison director was treated for injuries after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, agents from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) were called to the prison to quell a serious disturbance in which inmates threw balls of billiards at CDCR officers.
The hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding.
It is unusual for a tropical depression to make landfall in Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen to us early in the week that comes when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the Southwest Desert, with the potential for flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for flash flooding in the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The hurricane is expected to make landfall in the state of Arizona on Sunday.
The Phoenix Weather Service said 10 hurricanes had maintained their tropical or depression status in a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix from 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina was on the verge of making landfall in Arizona.
The latest hurricane models at the National Hurricane Center forecast 5 to 10 inch (130 to 250 mm) of rainfall, with 15 inch (380 mm) or more in some areas of the Mogollon Rim.
It is likely that between 2 and 5 inches of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 inches in isolated areas, including the Southwest, the Rocky Mountains, and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of flash flooding, the rains of Rosa are a blessing, as the region is suffering from a drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that some of these torrential rains will be beneficial due to the conditions of drought that are currently experiencing in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 % of Arizona is suffering from extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
The hurricane will make landfall in Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane-force wind with maximum sustained winds of 136 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
So, the storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm early on Monday.
Mexico could be threatened with torrential rains, which could lead to flooding.
“We expect torrential rains of between 7 and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a possibility of reaching 25 cm.”
After that, Rosa will head north to Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the border of Arizona in the early morning of Tuesday. 

Spanish: 
“The main threat to Rosa or her remains is the heavy rainfall from the heavy rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. Southwest.
The expected rainfall will cause flash flooding and mudslides, and potentially deadly landslides in desert areas and mountainous regions.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects in a murder attempt after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, towards 4:00 on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he is “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area, according to Avon Police.
The agents have made a plea for anyone who has recorded the incident with a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “sufrió la mezquindad y la ira” of the Democratic Party.
“Voting for the judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has “suffered the vengeance and anger of the Democratic Party” during the entire process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying vehemently and emotionally charged the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford of having been sexually assaulted by him when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified on this charge.
The Saturday, the president said that, that day, Americans saw the “smarts, courage, and quality” of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the legalists with most achievements of our days, a jurist with a record of admirable public service,” said to his supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to the Kavanaugh nomination by speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“There are five weeks for an election that’s going to be a life changing one for all of us.”
I don't present myself, but I am a runner.
“So I’m always on the move, trying to find great candidates.”
Trump accused Democrats of “resistance and obstruction”.
The first major vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation is expected to be held on Friday, reported a high-level party official to CNN.
Centenars of deaths in a quake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is increasing.
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the enormous waves that were generated by a powerful earthquake and a massive tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities.
Centenars of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when waves of up to six metres high came to the coast at dusk, carrying many to their death and destroying everything in their path.
The earthquake was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami warning was issued, people were still on the beach and they were not evacuated immediately, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a BNPB spokesman.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it carried everything that was in the way, including cars, logs, houses, everything that was on land. The tsunami was moving at 800 km/h before it hit the coast.”
Some people had climbed to the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated from Palu.
The photos of the devastation of the city were published by the agency.
The earthquake struck the city of San Francisco, California, on the morning of September 18, 1989.
The earthquake zone had 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Application and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) released a statement that the energy released by the earthquake was 200 times greater than the energy of the bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which sits on the end of a long and narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “important” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial buildings and hotels had collapsed.
According to the police, some bodies of some of the victims trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings were found.
Nugroho said the number of deaths and damage could be higher than the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were completely paralyzed and there was no information.
“There are 300,000 people living in the area”, said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its personnel and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse.”
The disaster has been described as the worst natural disaster in the history of the Philippines.
In a video captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the last floor of a building is heard warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, tearing through buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications in the area around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The Indonesian military started sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, declare officials, but the people still need food and other basic supplies.
The airport has reopened for emergency and humanitarian relief operations only.
The president Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although the World Vision staff in Donggala have arrived safe and sound in Palu, where they are sheltered under a tent in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating picture on their way, as they passed through the village of Doseba.
“They said they had seen many houses destroyed.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as the disaster relief groups were putting together the machinery of assistance, some people were lamenting that there was not a wider range of supplies and equipment being sent to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, only foreign funding, supplies and personnel can be used if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
The only thing that has happened is that the world is now aware of the existence of the universe.
“The disaster is still a provincial disaster”, said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares it a national disaster, we can start to send help abroad.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of the people still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the stories that they write about natural disasters.
The child was rescued from a sewer pipe.
The rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, a national paragliding instructor, had formed two of the missing paraglidists for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those trapped in the hotel Roa Roa, the Mandagi family, were his students.
“I have a lot of experience in the field of paragliding, and I carry my own emotional load.”
The hotel owner, Mr. Gendon, remembered how, in the hours that followed the news of the hotel Roa Roa collapsing, he had sent desperate messages to the competition in paragliding, who were participating in the festival that was held on the beach.
However, his messages only showed a check mark in grey, not two in blue.
“I think it means that the messages were not delivered.”
Ladders steal $26,750 from a bank in Newport on the Levee
The robbery occurred on Friday morning, when a bank employee was robbed at a Brink ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking 26 750 USD, according to a police note.
The driver of the car had emptied a bank in the center of entertainment and was preparing to recharge it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man “came running behind the employee of Brink” and stole a bag of money intended for the money recharge.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects and going away from the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye.
Kanye West will be changing his name to Ye.
Announced on Twitter on Saturday: “The person previously known as Kanye West”.
West, 41, is now known as Ye, the name he used for his eighth album, released in June.
The change arrives before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
The show's host, Stephen Colbert, was forced to cancel his performance after Ariana Grande canceled her show.
And he said he had a religious meaning to the word.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’”, commented West in early this year while talking about the title of his upcoming album with Big Boy.
“We are you, we are us, it means us.”
He was Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to become Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
It's one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, Jay-Z, has used his name in all caps or in all caps without a period.
The Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador promises not to use the army against the civilian population.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the future president of Mexico, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that it is 50 years since a bloody repression against students in Mexico.
The next day, López Obrador pledged in Tlatelolco square that he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.
The 2 October 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people.
López Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
United States should double funding for I. A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional of I. A. who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments arise after the announcements of the I. A. of several parts of the U.S. Government, even when, in general, the U.S. does not have an official I. A. policy.
China's plan is to become the number one in innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for research in I. A. would be a good start, given that most other countries are lagging behind the U.S. in the field of I. A.”, says Lee.
The double of funding means the double of possibilities of the next great breakthrough in I. A. being reached in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most important I. A. companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, in the Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a computer system that defeated the best American player of Othello.

Spanish: 
Lee recognized the previous US Government robotics competition, the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next generation of visionaries would be.
In the United States, scientists often have to work hard to get government grants.
“China is not taking away the leaders,” said Lee.
In the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired people from universities to work in I. A.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States intensify its efforts in Afghanistan.
I think doctors in I. A. should be given permanent residency cards automatically.
The Chinese State Council of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Next Generation
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China funds scientists from universities and other academic institutions, but the quality of work in China is lower than the work of scientists in the United States, Lee said.
In the beginning of this year, the Department of Defense of the United States established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic fields.

Spanish: 
Also, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
National Science Foundation invests more than $100 million a year in science research.
While the U.S. legislation that created a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not moved a step in months.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on changing the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbor to the north is a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into the NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on a new name, but the opposition nationalists claim the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population in Macedonia.
The president Georgi Ivanov has said he won't vote in the referendum and a campaign of boycott has put doubt on whether the referendum will be valid.
In the referendum ballot there was a question on the ballot: “Do you approve of the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the name change, including the first minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying to make Macedonia a member of the European Union and the NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, to have a life with freedom under the European Union, because this means a life more secure for all of us”, said Olivera Georgijevska, of 79 years, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to be decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in the Parliament.
The Electoral Commission declared that, at 1:00 p.m., there were no irregularities.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34 % of the last elections to the Parliament, when 66 % of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I’ve come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe”, said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, the country's first Prime Minister, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their ballot in the referendum on a name change for the country that would open the way for it to join the NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and removed chairs from the tents set up by those who were protesting the referendum.
We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high, not by the back door, not like that.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to enter like Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, like China and Russia, and join the integration with the Euro-Asian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says Macedonia's membership in NATO would bring investment that the country needs.
“I think that the majority of the citizens will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO.
He said a positive result would be a “confirmation of our future”.
In a poll published Monday, a poll showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters were likely to participate in the referendum, which means a lower turnout than the required 50 percent.
Another poll by Macedonian TV revealed that 57% of those polled had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote for Obama.
To be valid, a referendum must be approved by 50% of the voters.
If the plan fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government of President Benigno Aquino III since he took office in May last year.
This is a beautiful goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense in the City's 2-0 win over the visitors at the City of Manchester Stadium.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The midfielder received a pass in the middle of the field.
Running through three defenders before running into the open.
A few days later, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He evaded a defender before beating several more in the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where was Sterling.
The Englishman used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who then hit the ball with his right foot to avoid the goalkeeper with a right-footed shot that went to the right side of the net.
“Agüero has some issues with his foot.”
We're talking about him playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That was what happened.
We had luck that he scored in that moment.
Sterling scored the first goal in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton goal.
He made a nice pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave some touches before directing Sterling to the second stick.
The ball was thrown to the net just before the player left the boundaries.
The City will face Hoffenheim in a group stage match of the Champions League Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil the party for the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer is expected to start on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, won't win the division title against Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still chase after their first division title.
“Although we don't have anything to play for, at least we can step on the ice with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be cheering and that the other team will probably play at a high level.
Why not?
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but it appears that they're going to keep Scherzer in the game.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, will have his practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest schedule on Sunday.
The history of the Washington bullpen is of 18 wins and 7 losses, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 entries.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, by speaking of the importance of the Republican Party's participation in mid-term elections.
In November, we are at the point where everything we have done is on the line.
Five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's a very important race. No one else is going to be there, so I'm going to have to fight for it.
We have a terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, they see malice, evil.
They don't care who they hurt or damage nor do they care who they have to pass over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control. And they won't give it to us.
Democrats are on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
“We have seen these last four days”, said, saying that Democrats “were angry, bad, and false”.
He made reference to the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the boos of the audience.
“I don’t know,” he said.
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, I don't know, I hope you have a response.
The Labour Party is a broad spectrum party.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When the activists of Momentum of my local party voted to censure me, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I'm the last of a long line of Labour MPs who are told they're not welcome, and only because they say what they think.
My colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, was categorically against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not being in agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
He was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to Europe.
As a result, we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
During the last eight years I have been a member of the local Labour Party Parliamentary Party, that is exactly what the nightly meetings of the General Committee have been.
Though the current tone of many meetings is not the kind of warm and friendly one that was once common, the promise of a more kind and gentler policy is still remembered, if it ever was.
Each opinion is clearly disliked in the Labour Party and is judged in terms of whether the leaders of the party consider it acceptable or not.
This began after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he shared a similar political vision started to expect him to change radically his opinion and to adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, regarding security national or on the market single of the EU.
Always that I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults in the social media demanding my retirement, accusing the centre of policies that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I've been the only one to experience it.
I'm lucky to be a little bit more fortunate than some of my peers, as comments on me tend to be political.
I'm amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist and racist insults daily, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of our political era is the normalization of insults.
The week before, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that now we don't have that wide range of opinions and, with each motion “of censure” or each change in the rules of selection, the party gets tighter.
In the last two years, I have received many counsels that recommended I keep my head down and not make myself too noticeable.
But I don't want to be in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party in high school, I was motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my school's classroom in ruins, and I've tried to improve the public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a minister.
I have never hidden my political views either, either in the last elections.
It is impossible that anyone in Nottingham East could have been unaware of my political views and the areas in which I disagreed with the current leaders.
I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday that I don't understand these efforts to lose time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the electorate: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any opportunism will impede me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr's undefeated rises to the top.
Two late goals can have decided the final result, but, without doubt, Ayr deserved the win in this entertaining Premiership game.
Now they are the only undefeated team in the ten that play.
At the end, it was the superiority of their defense, as well as their ability to capitalize on opportunities, that gave the team a victory, so that the coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
“We have been tested in all the games and we have been undefeated, so I’m glad we’re still undefeated.”
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: “The Ayr sees the opportunity, they took the chances better than us”.
The 14th minute try by Grant Anderson, converted by Frazier Climo, gave the Ayr a lead; but a yellow card to Rory Hughes, a loaned Warrior for the game, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the deficit and Jason Baggot scored a try that was not converted.
Climate extended their lead to 10 points. Before halftime, they scored a try and converted a penalty, leaving the score 17-5 in their favour at halftime.
However, the second half started well for the Reds, and the score was tied at five points.
After a long break by a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, and, when the game resumed, Ayr scored a try by McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed the Melrose to once again take advantage of having a man more with a try not converted by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a huge amount of pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for placing Struan Hutchinson without the ball, from the line of scrimmage, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
Climate converted, as he had been doing since the restart, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong on a kick and sent Gregor Henry to the back of the net to make the score 5-0.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to turn his career towards the restaurant industry.
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to enter the restaurant sector after discovering he has been named director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC programme, which he wrote and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, but a source from the Scottish Sun reported that Kiernan wanted to “involve in the “flourishing” market of the “restaurant” in Glasgow.
“The sea belongs to us: a Bolivia without a coast has the hope that the court will reopen the Pacific route.
Naval personnel watch a naval base in La Paz.
In public buildings flags are flown.
From the Titicaca Lake to the Amazon River, the bases show the motto: “The sea belongs by right,”
Reclaiming it is a duty.
In Bolivia, where the sea is no longer present, yet they still remember vividly the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict for the resources that took place in the nineteenth century, and the desire to return to navigating the Pacific Ocean.
The country's hopes are the largest in decades, as Bolivia hopes for a major victory in decades.
“Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision.
Many Bolivians will watch the verdict of the International Court of Justice in large screens across the country, with the hope that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a seaward outlet.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is battling for reelection in the year that comes, also has much to say about the resolution of Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean”, said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would not change much if it did.
The UN has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The court's decision to hear the case was only six months after the final arguments.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years have been a frustrating time for the Bolivian cause.
The problem of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian government.
Morales has been using the term "imperialismo" to refer to Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to keep talking after this.
The two countries don't exchange ambassadors since 1962.
The former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually quick.
The Monday offers Bolivia “an opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “putting an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutually beneficial results”, said.
Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, has used the issue of the maritime dispute with Chile as a political tool.
“Bolivia never will give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean”, said President Evo Morales.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave behind the past”.
North Korea says it will not disarm unless it can trust the U.S.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, says that his country will never be the first to disarm nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill its pledge to the Philippines to hold a referendum on the question of the country's future status.
His comments arrive in the moment when Mike Pompeo, secretary of State of the United States, appears to be about to restart talks on nuclear disarmament with North Korea, which have been suspended for more than three months.
Ri says the continued sanctions and opposition of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korean War is a “fantasy”.
Washington is skeptical of North Korea's declaration of a nuclear-free zone without a clear and unequivocal North Korean withdrawal.
Kim and Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is a widespread skepticism about the sincerity of North Korea of abandoning its nuclear arsenal.
Pyongyang has been preparing for a second summit between the leaders of North and South Korea.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest huge hat line that is about to land in a street of shops near you.
If you want to add some fun to your collection of hats or to protect yourself from the sun, don't look any further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a bizarre collection of huge hats for their spring summer collection of 2019 on the runway, shocking the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have been inundating Instagram this summer and these designers have taken them to the runway.
The most notable piece of Valentino's was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large accessories were snakes with jewels, a hat with magic, and a pineapple, but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn and resembled more of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
A creation reminded one of a full-scale diving suit, snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you love big size fashion, you're lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge hats will be seen in stores.
The huge hats are making a comeback, with a hat with a 60 cm wing used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand that made the iconic beach hat has unveiled a new beach bag.
The bag of orange-dyed rafia, decorated with fringe and white handle, was the main item of the La Riviera collection by Jacquemus for the Paris Fashion Week Spring-Summer 2019 season.
As Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the next summer, I’m expecting the
Language skills are fundamental for citizens of the world.
Scotland's independent schools have a long history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in the exams that is reinforced by the successes of individuals and collectives in sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these independent schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SISC, por sus siglas en inglés), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools have as objective to prepare their students for higher education, to prepare them for their chosen career, and to prepare them for the place they will occupy as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a curriculum that can adapt to the needs of the modern world, the languages of modern languages are still popular and desired in schools.
If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message gets to his head.
If you talk to him in his language, he gets to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you can't rely solely on English.
If we consider the recent exam results, we can observe that languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest grades in the private schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from 74 centers that form part of the SCIS, showed that 72 % of students achieved an A in Chinese, while a 72 % of students achieved an A in German, a 69 % of students achieved an A in French and a 63 % of students achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that children and young people will need in the future, without doubt.
In the present day, languages are considered to be at the same level as the STEM subjects in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that, of the reasons that employers gave for the difficulties they had in filling jobs, 17% attributed it to language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important for young people to prepare for their future careers.
Language skills are increasingly important in a world of globalization.
Independent of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because of the skills they will have learned.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will allow that person to be ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4000 adult British in 2013, only 75 percent of them could speak any foreign language well enough to keep a conversation. 

Spanish: 
By teaching children to speak a foreign language, you can help them learn to think and communicate with others.
If they know several languages, especially the economies in developing countries, children will be better equipped to have better opportunities to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centers will focus on modern languages such as English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian, while others will teach the most important languages for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Any child's interests are the same as those of any other child.
Independent schools in Scotland devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to have success, whatever that may be.
In these moments, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, the importance of languages is vital for the future of the country, so that this should be reflected in the education.
Languages are international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It's good to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Independent Scottish Schools Council.
LeBron James debuts with the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for fans who are waiting to see LeBron James debut with Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is unknown how long he will play.
“It will be more than one and less of 48”, commented Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The reporter for the Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that it was likely that James would play a few minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason program of the Lakers.
“In this stage of my career I don’t need to play in pre-season games to prepare myself.”
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube
The president Donald Trump starts a series of campaign rallies this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five rallies Trump is scheduled to hold in the next week, including stops in places with Trump supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy in the interim, Trump is attempting to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are running the risk of losing control of the House of Representatives when the votes are cast in November.
Is there a Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. this Saturday, September 29th, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live stream on YouTube.
It's likely that Trump will comment on the hearings of this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, that were tense because of the sexual conduct allegations and have left in the meantime awaiting a Senate vote on, as much as possible, a week while the FBI investigates.
The purpose of the rallies is to help Republicans who are facing the November elections take off.
The campaign's message is that the five rallies are designed to “inspire and motivate” volunteers and supporters while the Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.
“The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while campaigning.”
Programmed at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight could draw a crowd of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as having media coverage in the Pittsburgh media.
The state of West Virginia is the second time in a month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a candidate for the U.S. Senate from West Virginia, who is lagging in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come to give a push in the polls,” commented Simon Haeder, a political science professor at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that it is not afraid to fight to keep alive the hope of a successful comeback.
After three singles matches, the foursomes of the final day of the weekend may be the cup's best shot.
The péndulo swinging concept is a completely invented sport, but players believe in it, more so in competitions like these.
Then, what would you say is the current impetus?
“They were six points ahead of us and now they’re four, so I think that’s a little bit of a boost.”
Europe has a clear advantage, by definition: four points ahead with twelve more to play.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel like they have a wind in their favor and motives to be cheerful, among other reasons because of the pairing of Spieth and Thomas, who played together all day and achieved three points of four each.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee to the green and preaches with the example.
The guttural screams of celebration rose in volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game when they were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the win in the 15th was received with a cry similar, of those that transmit that the American team is still not out.
“We need to do everything we can to win the game,” said Spieth.
That's what they've done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
Only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The odd couple of Europe has gone four of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who didn’t make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Friday afternoon, Saturday morning, and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That streak and the way it flows with the crowded and boisterous crowd is clearly the players to beat on Sunday, and that there won't be any other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it's early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a heroic stand with Sergio García, the hero of the four-ball morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But Sunday there will be no help for getting out of the holes.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch because they are close-up and you can see the interactions between the pairs, the counsels that they give and the strategies that they don't, and the way a strategy can change in a moment.
Until now, Europe has played better as a team and has a great lead going into the final day, but this session of four-balls also showed that the U.S. team is willing to fight, something that some Americans doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 in the Ryder Cup.
Europe has a good lead going into the final day of the Ryder Cup, after the fourballs and foursomes.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the field with two wins over a Tiger Woods who was in trouble, falling four points behind.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, won the World Cup by defeating the American team, led by Bryson DeChambeau, 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but did not shorten the gap.
The American Jim Furyk needs to win eight of the 12 matches on Sunday to retain the Vardon Trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four consecutive points.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, his magnificent union served to beat a dejected Woods and the American Dane Bryson Decahmbeau by a score of 5-4.
Woods, who in the two matches of the weekend had not been too impressive, had occasional moments of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to be the pair of Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a result 2-1.
Although the day was a pleasant and quiet day in the southwest of Paris, Europe was not all on its side.
The Americans were led by Spieth and Thomas, who each had a score of 71.
They won a stunning upset over Ian Poulter and Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after having lost the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, that a team recovered from a deficit of four points in the singles only has happened twice, although Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a draw to retain it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it appears that a counterattack is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it is “not possible” to disarm unilaterally if it does not have confidence.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea reported to the UN that the continued sanctions would deepen North Korea's distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of North Korea relinquishing its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a speech to the UN General Assembly that the country had taken “important measures” toward disarmament.
“We have received no response from the United States.
If we don't have trust in the United States, we can't have trust with respect to our national security, and, in that circumstance, there is no possibility of us first unconditionally disarming ourselves unilaterally.
Although Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea about the United States' refusal to negotiate a "phased" denuclearization process, his statement is important, as he did not reject without more a unilateral nuclear disarmament, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first North Korean leader in office meeting with an American president in June in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work towards “nuclear disarmament” and Trump committed to securing North Korea’s “security”.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has resisted calls to soften sanctions on North Korea.
The United States have consistently insisted on nuclear disarmament first and have increased pressure by way of sanctions in order to achieve their purpose of coercively, even by way of objecting to a declaration of war.
The idea that sanctions can make us kneel is a fantasy of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.
The North Korean leader did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim Jong-un and Trump, announced to the media at the United Nations earlier this week.
In contrast, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has been meeting with Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, three times in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea had been the party interested in the nuclear disarmament in place of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be in a state of stagnation.”
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from the speech of the year past, when she said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles toward American soil after the “evil” Trump, on a mission suicide, called Kim “rocket man”.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who the year before threatened to “destroy totally” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in the advance toward disarmament, but said that much more work was needed and that it was necessary to continue applying sanctions until North Korea was fully disarmed.
Trump said he didn't have a timetable for the withdrawal, but he didn't rule out it.
China and Russia allege that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its recent advances.
However, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported to the UN Security Council on Thursday, the imposition of UN Security Council sanctions must continue unceasingly and without default until we achieve a fully verified and fully-nuclearly-verified nuclear-weapons-free world.
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding to the country's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo talked to Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and subsequently commented that he would return to Pyongyang in a few weeks to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip wasn't good.
He left North Korea in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea denounced that its “requirements were those of a mobster”.
In a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un this month, South Korea's Moon Jae-in pledged to dismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons facility if the United States applies “corresponding measures”.
He said that Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he sought were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard's course on how to sleep enough.
Thanks to a new course that is being taught at Harvard University, all college students are now encouraged to sleep more in an attempt to fight against the growing culture of studying all night drinking coffee.
A professor discovered that students at the number one university in the world don't know the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist in sleep medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course arose after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the semester, a girl approached me and asked me why I hadn't told her about this now, in her last year.
He said he had never heard of the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains the basics of good sleep habits and how they contribute to academic and sporting success, as well as improving overall well-being.
The university decided to add the course after discovering that students were sleeping only one night a week.
The course of an hour includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes, and sports books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and the impact of lack of sleep on sporting performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to bed.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
After, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that it won't change the students' behavior overnight.
We believe that people have the right to know, and they have the right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco.
He said that the culture of pride for “passing the night in bed” still exists and added that the technology of modern and increasing pressure on students meant that the lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Sleeping the right amount of time and a good quality sleep should be “the secret weapon” of students to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain generate a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a California-born 19-year-old who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after having attended a class by him the year before during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
The university is looking to expand its graduate program to include a program for students who have already completed a bachelor's degree.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students think of putting an alarm for bed and another for awakening, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic devices and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm, and have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: The goal by Menga knocks the men of Gerrard out of the competition.
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when the attack of Dolly Menga unravelled the disarticulated team of Steven Gerrard.
The Rangers wanted to get their first away win since February 4, when they beat St. Johnstone 4-1, but the team of Gary Holt beat the Hearts for the second time in 18 games as a manager, leaving the Hearts top of the Premiership.
The Menga attack occurred at halftime and the Rangers' sluggish performance was not up to par at any time.
Now, the Rangers drop to sixth place, the Livingston climb to third, by goal difference.
Maybe the Rangers will have more trouble, as Calum Spence was treated for a blow to the head after someone threw a ball from the visitors' bench into the stands.
Gerrard changed eight of the starting players who won the game against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup.
By his part, Holt took 11 Livingston players who beat the Hearts last week and would have been pleased by the way his organized team drowned out their opponents in every way.
Canada's Soccer Hall of Fame honors the best Canadian soccer players of all time.
They should have marked at two minutes of play, when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman, who passed to Scott McGregor, who was left alone in front of Allan McGregor, but he missed the ball.
Keaghan Jacobs threw a free kick into the penalty area for captain Craig Halket, but Alan Lithgow could only send it over the crossbar.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction on their game in the final third.
No doubt about it. Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalised in the 15th minute, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson made no notice of it.
The Rangers got two shots on target in the first half, but the former Ibrox keeper, Liam Kelly, wasn't in any trouble dealing with the headed header of Lassana Coulibaly and the unremarkable snap of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by the Livingston came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the hard work and dedication they put into it.
The Rangers again failed to capitalize on a deep pass.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher scored, he kept calm and passed the ball to Robinson who calmly scored.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an immediate impact, as he passed the ball to Morelos, but Kelly came out of his line to block him.
But even so, the Livingston kept the visitors just right, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing a pass after another.
The Holt brothers could have pulled more profit in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed in a corner that did not enter.
The Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a collision with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
The Geiger counter is a device used to measure the radiation emitted by nuclear reactions.
Now, a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac section: 30 September 1882, today 136 years, and counting... was born in Germany the future physicist Hans Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radiation, a discovery that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which since then has become a symbol of science, also became a cultural icon, as in the movie “The Bells of Coronado”, from 1950, with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the dual roles of cowboys and scientists:
Man: “What is this thing?”
Radium Geiger Counter: A Geiger counter is a device used to measure the amount of radioactive material in the air.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactive emission of minerals.
Evans: “It’s like a radio!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the malignant cells.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab.
So, they can “see” a common protein to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating results that are promising for different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab to make them “see” a common protein found in many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
The professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promote the growth of different types of cancer”, like breast, ovarian, lung or colorrectal cancer, explained professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into a heated argument with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was booed in the studio of Saturday Night Live after a performance that was erratic and full of praise for President Donald Trump.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to despotricate against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
I often talk to someone white and ask them why I like Trump if he is racist.
I don't care about racism, I just want to play baseball.
SNL started the program with a sketch of Matt Damon mocking the statement of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the basis of the accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded a recording of the argument to his Twitter account.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
And West said he had been miserable between bastidores because he wore a baseball cap.
They came after me.
They said to me that I should not wear the hat.
They came at me!
Then I say, 'I'm asleep,' he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see me sleeping?” and added that he was going to put on his superman's coat, because that meant that nobody could tell him what to do. ¿Queréis que el mundo avance?
Try with love.
His comments received applause from the audience at least twice and the SNL members seemed to be embarrassed, as reported by Variety.
West had been invited to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many when he came out to the stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the conservative leader of the TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “One of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MUCHEDUMBER”.
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful”.
But I decide NOT to award someone (buying his music or his clothes, or supporting his art) who I consider is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We too.
Before the show, rapper Kanye West announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now known as “the person previously known as Kanye West”.
No one is the first artist to change their name, following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the legendary musician, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Intented murder charge for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear in court on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy drama series of the HBO, Game of Thrones.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those screen roles often transmitted to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes something went wrong and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones costar Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he finds it “very important” to address this issue.
“I think it’s important to me that we’re in this moment, what we’ve done with our masculinity,” he said.
“What have we been teaching men while they were growing up, thinking of the problems that are now?”
Kit thinks television can have part of the responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to his characters being so masculine.
What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and in the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that that's one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones when the series ends in summer, saying he is “tired of battles and horses”.
Starting November, Kit will star in True West, the Sam Shepard play that tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
I've been lucky to have met my wife, Rose Leslie, on the show.
“I met my wife on the show, so I think I’ll get my future family and my life from now on.”
Rose was the love interest of Jon Snow, the main character in the fantasy drama series "Game of Thrones".
The couple married in June 2018 in a family estate in Scotland.
AIDS: China reports 14 percent more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country there are more than 820,000 people affected, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, there were 40,000 new cases.
The majority of these were spread through sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread quickly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of blood infected with HIV.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV from this practice has been reduced to its practical end, Chinese health officials said in a conference in Yunnan province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by sexual contact is a serious problem in the gay community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community still suffers discrimination.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have calculated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with other men will marry women.
Many of the diseases are spread through sexual contact.
Since 2003, the government of China has pledged to make universal access to anti-HIV medications part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked information to Republicans in the Senate and asserts that it is “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
Representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegation that a member of her staff had published personal information of three U.S. Senate Republicans on Wikipedia.
The Democratic candidate for Los Angeles mayor, Lori Lightfoot, accused the right-wing media of trying to smear her.
“Lies, lies and more lies”, commented Waters on Twitter.
Supposedly, the published information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee, from Utah.
The person who leaked the information on the Internet on Thursday was an unknown person in the Capitol Hill Senate chamber during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leaked documents show that Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault by two women.
If conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the posts was associated with Waters' office, they made the data of a member of Waters' staff public.
“This accusation is completely false and a complete lie.”
The member of my personal whose personal data, security, and privacy have been affected as a result of these false allegations and fraudulent and false information leak, was not the source of the leak.
This allegation is completely false and a complete lie.
The statement by Waters sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Disproves this information with anger”, wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that temperance is not necessary to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something that he did not do, he should not be angry.
Don't rebel.
Don't question the motives of the accuser.
You must keep calm and be calm.
It seems that Fleischer was trying to compare the reaction of Waters to the Democratic Party's criticism of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during his confirmation hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it is true, it is very serious”, tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned law enforcement officials and the enforcement agencies of these alleged frauds.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are discovered, and that they are legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous acts and actions against all members of my staff.”
Cruella de Vil: The Beagle Boys.
Now it has become a tradition to look for a British twist in any new British action comedy.
Is this satirical parody of the absurdly over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top, over-the-top
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his salt-shot eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his driver's license for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything else, this is a comic creation designed for territories of English-speaking countries.
By contrast, the ridiculous agent secret who, despite his silly pretensions of glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a smattering of that guy who played a note in the theme song of the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
In addition, in its origin it was based on the mysterious international man traveller and international represented by Atkinson in the long-forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard, causing chaos after him.
In this last chapter, there are a couple of good moments.
I loved watching Johnny English dressed in a medieval armour as he approached a helicopter while the helicopter's rotor blades collided with the ship's hull.
The Atkinson don for physical comedy is obvious, but the humour is a bit too short and the jokes are a bit too superfluous, especially now that franchises like 007 and Mission: Impossible add comedic elements without problems.
The humour seems more directed at children than at adults and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as funny and clever as the Mr. Bean jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of current affairs is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A pirate computer has infiltrated the super-secret spy network of Britain, revealing the identities of all its active agents in active service, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the drop that tips the glass for the first minister, a pompous and cornered character who is seeing how she sinks into political popularity: Emma Thompson delivers her best performance as the sharp-tongued Emma Thompson, but the script doesn't give her much room to work.
His intelligence advisers tell him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to look to some retired spies.
That's the wrong Englishman, Johnny English, who now teaches in a private school, although there are some funny jokes, because it's a spy school like the one in the movie School of rock.
English is taken to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his former compinche Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a sympathetic role for which he does not fully appreciate Vicki Pepperdine.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things horribly wrong in the Secret Service of His Majesty's Most Gracious Majesty are back in action, with the beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
While the first minister is falling in the arms of a charming multimillionaire of the technology world who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their absurd adventures: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a French elegant restaurant, unleash the chaos on the luxury yacht of Volta; English also becomes a pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Definitively, they went all out in the last scene, but, by very loud and loudly, the whole thing still sounds a bit childish.
A fairly good product.
I wonder if the British film industry could give Johnny English a role that truly appreciates his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is working on a plan to make British workers work four days a week, but earn five.
The Labour Party is planning a radical plan with which British workers would work four days a week, but would be paid five.
Supposedly, the party wants to encourage employers to invest the savings made by the AI revolution in their employees, giving them a day off.
So, employees would enjoy three days' pay for each weekend.
According to sources, the idea “would fit” in the economic agenda of the party to align the country to favor workers.
This week of four days has received the support of the Congress of Labor, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the economy changing.
As a high-level Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: A review of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"There won't be a day when the work week of four days is a question that the party will certainly incorporate into its economic strategy in favor of the worker, as well as in the strategy of the overall industrial policy of the party".
The Labour Party has not been the first to support this type of ideas, as the Green Party has already pledged a four-day workweek in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
No matter how much the Labour Party supports the legalisation of same-sex marriage, it is not clear that the party will support the bill.
Un portavoz of the Labour Party said: "The weekend work week is not part of the party's policy and it won't be discussed at this time".
The Labour Party shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used the shadow cabinet conference last week to present his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
The McDonnell brothers said they were willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "exploited companies" who provide public services.
The current shareholders of water companies would not be able to recover their investment, as a government Labour government could apply deductions that reflected the irregularities perceived.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in the boards of directors of the private sector companies and create funds of inclusive ownership in which the 10% of shares of the private sector companies should be held by the employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to £500 per person.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak on "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh and if it could change their minds.
The investigation that is being conducted by the FBI on the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week the final vote on his confirmation as a justice of the Supreme Court and raises the question of whether the results that are concluded could influence some Republican senators who decide to finally withdraw their support.
In an interview to be aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asks Senate Republicans John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could uncover evidence that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolinian counterpart.
"Yes, it is clear," said Kennedy.
I was in favor of the hearing, I spoke to the judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after everything had happened, when I heard the allegation and asked: 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolved, and tajante.
The vote of Graham, however, seems unchangeable.
I have already made a decision on the matter of Brett Kavanaugh and would not hesitate to overlook the allegation.
"Dra. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it tautly.
"No one of the people she named has ever confirmed it.
It was 36 years ago.
It's always the same, no matter what the case.
What is the Global Citizen Festival?
This year's Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City on Saturday, June 1.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will move to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness campaign that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the concert (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), the concert goers have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions”, like volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, or making a call.
What has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years?
The idea of rewarding with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of "clicktivism", which is called the "clicker mentality", that we adopt when we believe we are making something really useful by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, leaders around the world have announced commitments and policies that will have a value of more than $37 billion, which will benefit more than 2250 million people by 2030.
In 2018, the company made 390 commitments and announcements that arose from its actions, of which, at least 10 000 million USD have been raised or pledged.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced 649 million people in all over the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and executing with headquarters in the UK, and the common goal of helping children grow and develop with all their potential. With this end in mind, they have pledged to provide Rwanda with 35 million $ to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thank you for your support, donors, governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a small mark in the history of social injustice by ending hunger.
The group also claimed that, after having carried out more than 5000 actions to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the UK government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition interventions.
We believe that the most effective way to address poverty is to provide the resources to do so.
It will be a long and difficult road and, in many instances, we will fall and we will be hurt.
But, like they did previously the movements in favor of human rights and against apartheid, we'll achieve our goals, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we'll be getting from the New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to block exports of Russian energy.
"In the event that Russian energy would be disruptive to the markets, Washington could call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the Middle East, including the energy market in the United Arab Emirates, according to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates on the orders of the legitimate government, is merely a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I'm convinced that they're in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier of energy to the south of Europe."
There are also ways and methods to tackle this issue.
"United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to guarantee that the seaways remain open and, in the case that energy is not available in the market, they could even block the seaways to guarantee that energy doesn't end up in the market."
Zinke spoke to people who attended a gathering organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that is described as the "voice of the consumer energy" in the United States.
In his book, "The End of the Line", he compares the approaches Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The alternative economic in Iran and Russia consists, basically, in using and replacing fossil fuels.
These assertions are made when the administration Trump has been trying to push its natural gas exports to Europe and to relieve Russia of its role as the cheapest source of natural gas for European consumers.
To do so, the administration Trump, including the very own Trump, try to persuade Germany to abandon the "unprofitable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has consistently insisted on the gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, which has a value of 11 000 million $ and is intended to double the capacity of the current gas pipeline to 110 000 million m3, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin denies that the United States' opposition to the project is solely economic and is a show of competition.
"I believe that all of us share the idea that energy cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said the Energy Minister of Russia, Aleksandr Novak, after celebrating a meeting with Rick Perry, the Secretary of Energy of the United States, in Moscow in September.
The American position has been met with opposition from Germany, who has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has asked the U.S. to not intervene in the energy policy of the EU or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a meeting that was held recently between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Warren will consider running for president in 2020.
Senator Warren said she would consider running for president after midterm elections.
During a news conference in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering this challenge.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to mend our broken government and to make sure that, for the first time, women are in the leadership."
"After the 6th of November, I'll seriously consider running for president".
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a public appearance and stated that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction".
I really care about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren spoke without hesitation about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from Friday, Warren said "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote".
The survey showed that Warren's own voters do not believe that he should run for president in 2020.
A 58 % of Massachusetts voters said they thought Sen. Hillary Clinton should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
A poll of 1,000 people found that 32 percent supported his candidacy.
In the survey, Governor Deval Patrick received a 38 percent of support and 48 percent of opposition.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for the 2020 presidential election of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would announce his decision to run for president in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the posttraumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, passed a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
The arrest and subsequent arrest warrant were issued by the police department of the City of San Francisco.
"The situation that is facing my son, by what he has been through since he came back, they know very well the other families that suffer the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder and other injuries that come with our soldiers.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo of which no one wants to talk, and commented on his son and other veterans of war who "turn with a behavior different, hardened, asking if there really is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country.
The Monday was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, charged with a domestic violence incident and possession of drugs or alcohol while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to get a new immigration policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new immigration policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district wrote a letter to show their support for a refugee applicant who is facing the current immigration policy, reported NBC News.
The case is filed under the name of Grace Grace, a woman who was arrested in August for refusing to pay a $100 fine for refusing to remove her sunglasses.
He said that his partner "and his kids, who are members of a violent street gang", abused her, but the U.S. immigration authorities denied his request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers who represent these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a great number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations that face generalized problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new immigration policy of the United States reversed a 2014 decision that took the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB, por sus siglas en inglés) to grant asylum to undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, made a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
According to federal law, all asylum applications must be granted on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim and, in this case, this exception violates that principle.
The law also harms the economy by discouraging immigrants from entering the country.
The U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and abuse.
"Migrants can apply for asylum if they leave their home countries for reasons of persecution or threats to their life, religion, nationality or political opinion," Sessions said when announcing this directive on June 11, 2016.
The asylum never was created as a measure to address all the problems, or even all the problems that people face daily.
Desperate efforts to rescue survivors as the number of dead rises while the search for survivors continues.
For survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"The situation is very tense", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while trying to comfort her baby with fever in a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
Each minute ambulances bring in more bodies.
Water is scarce.
Some residents have returned to their homes destroyed to rebuild their lives and to rebuild their lives.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals are also damaged.
Some of the injured; among them, Dwi Haris, who has the back and an upper arm broken, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building due to the constant earthquakes, also very strong.
He couldn't stop crying when he told me about the violent earthquake he lived while in the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and his daughter.
We didn't have time to escape.
I was trapped in the rubble of the wall that was destroyed, I think," said Haris to Associated Press.
I heard my wife ask for help and there was a long silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're all well.
The U.S. Ambassador to China accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily where they promoted the benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
The past Wednesday, President Donald Trump made reference to the China Daily's payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, the largest selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of wanting to immerse itself in the upcoming election to the United States Congress.
The accusation that Trump made against China's attempts to influence the U.S. elections marked what officials in the U.S. indicated as a new phase in a campaign by Washington to pressure China.
Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has led to increasingly high levels of tariffs on both sides.
The tariffs China imposed on exporting companies were intended to hit the Republicans, who backed Trump, according to experts in China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the former Iowa governor and current U.S. ambassador to China, said that Beijing had harmed American farmers, workers and businesses.
According to Branstad, in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register Sunday, China "is intensifying its pressure on our free press with publications in our press free".
China uses the American tradition of free speech and press freedom to try to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register.
"In contrast, in the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few scattered voices that reflect the disparate opinions that the Chinese people have on the troubling trajectory of their country's economy, as the firm grip of the Communist Party of China is firmly in place.
One of the most prominent Chinese newspapers declined to publish my article.
Republicans are said to be drifting away from women before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle.
As many Republicans of renown are closing ranks behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the numerous allegations of sexual assault against him, analysts have warned that a backlash may occur from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed their desire to move on with the vote.
"In this type of issues, it is impossible to backtrack", said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of the University of Siracusa, in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher doubts Flake's last attempt to calm voters is enough to calm voters dissatisfied with the FBI's investigation.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday; they won't forget it in November or in November.
The protesters chanted "November is coming!" (¡noviembre llegará pronto!) as they marched to the Senate floor to protest the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is out of all expectations", said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst.
The impact is already very significant and, in fact, so is.
But it could be even greater, especially among women in the suburbs and the young women and voters in the outer neighborhoods, who don't vote often even though they don't like the president".
Even before the public testimony of Ford, which detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts said a backlash could occur if the Republicans went forward with confirmation.
This issue has become a major political issue for the Republican Party, said Michael Steele, the former national chairman of the party, to the weekend's NBC News.
"It's not just the vote on the committee or the vote on the bench; it's also the way the Republicans have handled it and how they've treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, but they are a few more the ones who are on the side of this one.
In a new YouGov poll, 41% of those polled believe Ford's testimony definitively or probably, while 35% believe Kavanaugh's testimony definitively or probably.
About half of those polled said they thought Kavanaugh had lied, while the other half said he had told the truth.
After the push of Flake, the FBI is investigating the statements of Ford, as well as, at least, the other two allegations, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez said he was shown the candidate's genitals in a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to challenge Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the legend of technology. A company that bases itself on the open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to select where to store their data and who will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Sir Tim Berners-Lee joked saying that the intention behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
"It's got to be now", said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment".
The application uses Solid's technology to enable users to create their own "personal data warehouse" or a POD.
It can contain tasks, task lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a browser and at the same time.
One thing that is exclusive to online personal storage is that the user is who decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal data training".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's director general, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills necessary to reach everyone.
The initial team included the founder, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, and a few of the developers who worked on the original World Wide Web.
A week from this week, developers of all kinds could create their own decentralized apps with the tools that are available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a radical change in their business models.
"We won't ask permission".
Inrupt's mission consists of providing commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Tim Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate over net neutrality.
Even though he is no longer the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the next web era," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War.
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years after.
The Reverend Bernard Vann received this award on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper was shot dead four days later and never knew he had been awarded the highest military honour in Britain.
The grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "a special symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made his grandfather a recipient of the Medal of Honor.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the intense fire of artillery and cannons".
After running to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage", made his way to the front before reaching a cannon with a single hand and downing three of the detachment.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "so great that I can never reach his height, but they were very aleccionadoras.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposed a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is shown when you show him a real backing".
The MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig.
Imagine you're all night up to watch Bellator 206 to see if you can see the main event.
The San Jose cartel had 13 fights, six of them included in the card's main event, and in the United Kingdom it was going to be televised live on the 5th.
At 6 am, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, the viewers in the UK were stunned when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people didn't even notice after having to stay up until early morning just to see the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change as "a joke gone too far".
There's a government regulation that governs the content that is broadcast from 6 h and this wasn't appropriate, so they had to change to the programming of kids.
"Peppa the pig", yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they will be changing the program to include British viewers in the next editions.
"When I think about the option of live streaming, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it's 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Monday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
When the programming changed, there were a lot of messages and not all were friendly, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't until the mid-19th century that the United States government began to take an interest in the problem of the blind.
I promise you that the next time it won't happen again.
We'll reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is the usual number we've done. We tried to offer more than usual to the fans and we were happy with the results.
It's a very unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was afraid of being gay.
The Olympic champion Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, but this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumphator.
At 24, he told us he didn't realize until he was in high school that "not all were like me".
In the first program of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention was to transmit "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him realize the importance of winning in the Olympics.
The host of "The Tonight Show", Kirsty Young, is absent for a few months with a health issue.
In the first episode of Laverne, Daley, who was shown to be a marginalized child, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "you don't accept socially that you like kids and kids".
He said: "I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I'm proud to be different.
He wanted to show that he was "something", so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games of this year in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without reprisals, and he wanted to pass on that hope to other people.
The three-time world champion also admitted that he was surprised to fall in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the winner of an Oscar, who is 20 years her senior, but she said the age difference never had been a problem.
When you live so much from so young, it's hard to find someone who's had the same kind of struggles as you.
The couple had a son in June who was named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
If someone had asked me a year ago, all the answers would have been 'I have to win a gold medal.'
But what is more important than the gold medals of the Olympics?
My gold medal from the Olympics is, without doubt, Robbie.
His son is called like his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and, of course, one of the last things he asked is if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I was unable to tell him that I couldn't be in the front row.
"He had his hand between my's when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that precise moment in the moment he stopped breathing that I realized he wasn't invincible", said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"In that moment I knew that that was the dream of my life: competing in the pool in front of my family in the Olympics, it was nothing better."
This fact was also the inspiration for him to choose his first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which he listened to in preparation for the Olympic Games.

Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 programme in which a celebrity guest is invited to a studio audience and is asked a series of questions about their life.
Mickelson, in poor form, was left on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson will play his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad tale.
Mickelson, who was playing in the event that is held every two years to achieve a record 12th time, was desbanked by captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes of the Saturday.
In place of being in the center of the action, as many times he has been for the United States, the five times champion of majors has had to conform himself with watching and, in other moments, trying to improve his game on the course and then, in other cases, trying to correct what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even in the height of his career, the player of 48 years isn't in his best shape for the golf course Le Golf National, where the rough longstrokes punishes with errors.
Yes, if the field isn't enough to be discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth game of the Sunday's final round, will face the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12-game singles competition, had started the match with a good showing, the Mickelson match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, he could say nothing more.
"I understood perfectly what he was doing today, he gave me a palm in the back and, surrounded by his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow."
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and has made a lot of contributions to these teams before and this week.
Probably I didn't imagine playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest.
Mickelson will surpass Faldo's record of most Ryder Cup matches played.
It could be the last of a long career of Ryder Cups that had never matched the level of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, although Furyk said that his presence added many more intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, inventive, funny, and a bit of a joker.
"I think the younger guys have enjoyed it.
It's more than just a game.
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership is about to disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you enter with a substantial lead in the last days of the Ryder Cup, you can easily become a challenging tournament.
The Danish player made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a band of Seve Ballesteros' team was leading by five points over the Americans, but at the end they only managed to finish with the other side just ahead by a narrow margin, winning 14½-13½.
"We're not going to stop talking about it. We're going to keep talking about it.
The history will show us that that team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
This is not over until the points are in the scoreboard.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that is our only goal.
I say it all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players of our team, but I'm also aware of the other side where they are, and they are the best players in the world.
I'm proud of what they've done in a tough golf course.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is to come is individual performances and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone you put a lot of pressure on yourself.
That's the message to send to players, to get the best of you.
Now it's time to leave your partner behind and go and do your best.
In front of Bjorn, his homólogo Jim Furyk will try to make his players better individually than they did as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who each won three points of four.
The same Furyk has been in both extremes in the last few days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won in Brookline and then lost when Europe brought up the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word", we said when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, was able to motivate his players on the final day.
We have 12 crucial games tomorrow, but we have to start strong like we did in Brookline, as you saw in the video.
When all progress is made in one direction, the pressure is placed on the middle parties.
We define our strategy and we made them feel that we were going to make a magic day.
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face off against Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover everything in the tour."
The new German Navy cruiser, delayed again.
The new German Navy frigate should have been ordered in 2014 to replace the old ships of the era of the Cold War, but it won't be until at least the year that comes due to defects and the increasingly progressive cost of the system, reported the local media.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to a statement by a military spokesman.
The ship should have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the ship was delivered delayed the completion of the project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a battery of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies of invisibility, like radar, infrared signals, and acoustic signals.
The newly developed system is expected to be more efficient and less expensive than the existing system.
However, the continuous delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) to be outdated when they finally start to serve, reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate occupied headlines last year when the German Navy refused to put the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
The first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after it has been delivered.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of "hardware and software defects" that made the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The deficiencies in software were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors: half the personnel on the former Bremen class frigates.
The ship's weight is also excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other ships of similar size that were used by the Germans in World War II.
The project has also been plagued by problems with the hardware, including the training of the crew, which has also been a problem.
It is believed that he has reached the sum of €3100 million ($4000 million).
The problems that are being attributed to the new frigates are of special relevance to the light of the recent warnings issued on the reduction of the naval power of Germany.
In the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, recognized that the navy is "running out of ships that can deploy".
The official said that the problem has been worsening over time, because old ships were given up, but not replaced with new ships.
The only ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that have been able to join the Navy are the two ships of the "Baden" class.
The National Trust spy on the secret lives of bats.
This new study, which has been carried out in a state of the Highlands, tries to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The team is expecting to learn more about the behavior of only one mammal, the only flying mammal.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano bats, as well as the Daubenton and long-eared bats of the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
The bat-eared bat is a species of bat that is found in the United States and Canada.
The volunteers and staff of the NHS will also be using mobile devices to conduct mobile health surveillance.
The sounds captured will be analyzed to discover the frequency of the calls of bats and what species they call.
The report will then be produced, and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed image of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for NTS, expects the results to reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they use each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how to maintain forests for the bat and other species associated with them.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have been greatly reduced in the last century.
They are under threat by development and construction that affects their nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also be a threat to them, as are insecticides and other chemicals used in construction or attacks by domestic cats.
Mice are not truly blind.
Night-time hunters have their ears more useful than their eyes for hunting.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in all, takes the bat-related topic very seriously.
The team has ten experts trained in the subject, who carry out regular surveys, inspections of nests, and, occasionally, rescues.
The organization has also opened the first and only reserve dedicated to Scotland's only bat species in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Scotland's bat.
The territory is ideal for them.
Here, in Threave, there's a fantastic bat cave.
We have old buildings, many mature trees, and the right habitat.
However, there are still many things unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.
Reveals the importance of checking for bats before undertaking maintenance jobs within properties, as it can be destructive to a colony and could kill 400 pups and babies, which would be a total wipeout of a local population.
Bats are protected and is illegal to kill them, harass them, or disturb their colonies.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species about which we don't know how they evolve their populations".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has cataloged the allegations of rape as "fake news", and says people "want to be known" at the cost of their name.
His lawyers have been instructed to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the interview.
The Portuguese forward is accused of raping a woman in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of having paid 375 000 $ to hide the incident, as reported by Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a live Instagram video that has already amassed 142 million followers after being published a few hours after the news broke, Ronaldo, 33, tackled the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false.
"They just want to get paid for my name.
It's the same old story.
They want to be famous by mentioning me, but it's just me, I can't avoid it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the publication of allegations that appear in what they call "an unadmissible report on private life".
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will seek to obtain a settlement for "moral damages for a sum that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last years.
According to reports, the incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a night of drinking and dancing, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to Ronaldo's room and there, according to the documents, he raped the player anally, according to the court records in the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was in a "99 percent" a "good guy" and that he had "one percent" that he had "misbehaved".
Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with her, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also says he went to the police and had them take pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because he feared "revenge" and "feared to be humiliated in public".
The woman, 34 years old, is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has joined Juventus, a big Italian football club, for a contract of 100 million €.
Brexit: The UK would regret ever losing car makers.
The UK would regret the rest of its life if it lost its position as the world's leading car maker after Brexit, said Secretary of Industry Greg Clark.
Toyota UK said it was "preoccuping" that the UK's main carmaker, Toyota, would stop production if Britain left the European Union without a deal.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of Brexit delays on its business could result in the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes models Auris and Avensis of Toyota, produced 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that, if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, director general of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have shown their fears in relation to the UK's departure from the EU without a deal, especially in relation to trade cross-border; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the auto makers are the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
The line of production of Toyota is based on the just in time (JIT) production method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the 29th of March the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal, there could be a border disruption that could cause delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would be unable to accommodate the quantity of material equivalent to more than a day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in such case, production would be halted.
The UK's Chequers plan is calibrated precisely to avoid those controls at the border.
We need a deal. We want the best deal we can get.
"Toyota's evidence is that we have to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a successful supply chain".
Toyota has been unable to say for how long it would stop production, but warned of the long-term costs and, ultimately, the competitive advantage of the plant and, in the long run, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite plant manager, said his members were increasingly concerned: "As employment losses continue, it's not clear whether the jobs will ever be restored."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a clear and convincing plan to define our future relations with the EU".
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein is expected to be delayed again.
The meeting of high-risk Donald Trump with Justice Rod Rosenstein could be delayed another week, as the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump's ties to Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The speculation surrounding the decision whether to fire the United States Attorney General or not and, in this way, compromise the independence of Mueller has been fueled by Washington gossip for months.
The New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he had with Trump with a microphone that he himself carried to try to relegate Trump by way of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, the past Monday, he was at the White House, between news where it is said he was about to resign.
In his place, a meeting with Trump (who was in New York at the time) was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on Kavanaugh's nomination.
The FBI is investigating whether there is enough evidence to proceed with a criminal investigation of Kavanaugh.
The White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting, Rosenstein said: "We're not defining a date, we could be this week or we could delay it, considering all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
We'll be deciding on the spot and I'll be informing the press, as I usually do.
Some journalists would dismiss that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Why is the world so full of hate?
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to a dislike of journalists who act grandiloquently, although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they fanfarronean".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president performs more question and answer sessions than any other president before him", said, while citing no evidence: "We have compared those numbers".
The press conferences will continue, said Sanders, but if the press has the option of asking directly the president of the United States, I think it's much better than having me ask them to me.
We tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last weeks, so that you can now see us do it once again.
Trump usually answers questions when he is at the White House or when he participates in public or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
The press conferences with him are held only very rarely.
This week, in New York, the president demonstrated why he was so, where he made an appearance that was both fun and bizarre.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to workers at the NHS Scotland about your fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the staff working in the HHS of Scotland to express gratitude and wish them well after the UK leaves the EU.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter six months before the UK leaves the EU.
Scotland's government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU workers who work in the public sector that is not under the control of the central government.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal from the European Union have continued.
However, the UK government has also intensified preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I'm sure it must be a bit confusing for you.
I appreciate the contribution of each of you, regardless of your nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries contribute valuable expertise and skills that enhance and improve the work of health care, which benefits patients and communities to which we serve.
Scotland is your home and we love to have you back again.
Christopher Abercrombie is being operated on after suffering a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player was operated on after suffering a head injury in the last minutes of the game, when they were losing 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ.
The Tennessee State head coach, Rod Reed, said the injury occurred in the first half.
"He came to the band and collapsed there.
The trainer and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher and taken to the hospital for further examination.
A member of the Tennessee State University's football team said to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there was no details on the type of injury or the damage caused.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added 18 in total for the season.
To foreigners, a higher transmission tax will be levied when they buy a property in the UK.
Foreigners will be charged a higher transmission tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money that is raised will be used to give shelter to the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters.
The increase in the UK's land transmission tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120m a year to fund homelessness.
The additional money that is raised by the increase in the land transmission tax on foreigners will be used to fund social housing for the homeless, announced today.
The measure is understood as a way to neutralize the success that is enjoying Jeremy Corbyn with his promises of providing affordable housing for the younger voters and to target the wealthy.
The increase in the land transmission tax will be levied on those who do not pay UK taxes and that money will be used to combat the problem of homelessness on the streets.
The recargo, which is an additional tax on transmissions, also includes an increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand and rental properties and the "buy-to-let" system, which could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120m a year from the new tax.
The number of London properties being bought by people who are not in the UK has risen to 13% and is expected to increase.
Many of the most affluent areas of the country (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction of the estate tax with the aim of helping young people buy their first home.
Accused the big construction firms of maintaining very high prices on properties without intention of giving them any use and asked the Mrs. May to eliminate the "vergonzoso problema de la vivienda" in Britain.
The Labour Party leader Ed Miliband has announced a series of attractive reforms for housing, including controls on renting and the end of evictions without a reason.
The bill would give local governments more power to build houses.
The year last year I said I would devote my first term as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life of every new generation.
The housing market is so bad that it's devastated.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not possible that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes with greater ease than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of sleeping on the street is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland manager says his "primary objective" is to become a manager in Scotland someday.
The Scottish, 42, is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the club he helped to found, which at this point is in third place in the League One (the third division of English football).
He returned to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading the St. Mirren to the Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a hat.
But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it's something I always wanted to return.
That opportunity only becomes reality if I can lead a successful club.
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any fear when he passed to names so established in a club so big, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success of my career is measured by the success of my club in getting them back to the Premier League.
Because the structures and facilities of this club correspond to those of the Premier League.
It's not easy to achieve, but only if I can make it here, I can consider I have achieved my goal when I can return the club to where it should be.
Ross solover trained three years as a coach, after a few years as an assistant in Dumbarton and a period of 15 months as a coach's assistant in the Hearts.
After that, he helped Alloa to recover from relegation to the third division and helped the St. Mirren to win the championship in the following season.
Ross is now more comfortable than ever during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Probably it was a real encrucijada", said the former Alloa manager.
I always believed that direction was the best thing for me, much more than playing.
He was a good guy, and he could have made a lot of money with it, but he wasn't interested in it.
But playing can be very tough.
You have to face many things every week.
I still feel stress and pressure from that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I've always wanted to train and now I've achieved it, it's the time of my life when I've felt the best, without a doubt.

According to a survey, the best time to drink a beer is 5:30 in the afternoon on Saturday.
The heatwave of the summer has pushed profits in the British pub industry to a peak, but the pressure is on the chains of fast food restaurants.
The pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while the restaurants’ profits dropped by 4.8%.
The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup still makes the July pattern of the month of June, in which pubs increased a 2.8 % their profits, but restaurants have even fallen a bit.
The retail sales of restaurants fell 1.8% in June, the biggest decline in the industry in nearly a decade.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly alcoholic beverages had their best month, with bars making the most money.
The pubs that serve primarily food also suffered from the heat, but not as dramatically as the restaurants.
It seems people only want to drink.
In bars and pubs managed sales rose by 6.6% during the month, while food sales dropped by 3%.
Paul Newman, the analysts of hospitality and leisure of RSM said: "These results are consistent with the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The time and the impact of events such as social or sporting events very important factors in the market for outdoor activities.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still struggling, although the 4.8 % decline in sales from the year before will be particularly painful in view of the continuing pressure on costs.
The long and hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for the food operators and the weather is telling us that the cool temperatures that we've had in August will provide the relief that they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in new brands.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees the sales in the UK's bars, restaurants, and pubs sector, data is collected and analyzed from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is the market reference for the industry.
One in five kids have secret accounts on social media without their parents' knowledge.
One in five kids (some even 11 years old) have secret accounts on social media at the back of their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted by the company's parent company, found a sharp increase in the number of fake accounts on Instagram.
The news has aggravated fears that the content will be published.
About 20% of students have a "main" account that they show to their parents.
One in five kids (some even 11 years old) create fake accounts on social media that hide from parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of fake accounts on Instagram, a site of reference for sharing photos.
The news has aggravated fears of sexual content being published.
About 20% of students said they had a "main" account that they showed to their parents, while having other private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across a secret place where her daughter's 13-year-old daughter had been raped by a 13-year-old boy saw how a 13-year-old boy was encouraging others to rape her.
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of 11-18 year old children had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers feel compelled to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be a member of the board of the Scottish athletics federation as non-executive director.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from her international experience in the past decade.
"A Eilidh is recognized and respected in the entire community of athletics in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that the sport of athletics in Scotland will benefit from having her in her board of directors."
Doyle said: "I love being the spokesperson for athletes and I hope I can help develop sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 metres and the 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta between the four gold medals he won and now is a regular on the BBC, suffered a temporary stroke that left him unable to walk.
He suffered a stroke last month.
He couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was a tough walk, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again, and I had to learn agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!
The milk-swapping machine that is making headlines on the Internet.
A breast milk extraction machine company has divided opinion on the Internet with a controversial ad where they compare breastfeeding to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is claimed to be the first "silent breast pump" in the world, the technology company Elvie published a video inspired by a music video with a slightly ironic tone where mothers are shown enjoying the freedom that the new breast pump gives them.
Four real women dance in a hay barn full of hay, with letters like: "Yes, I ordeal myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you ever notice, I don't have nipples, I have my breasts".
The choir is still singing: "Ordénalas, ordénalas, estoy alimentando a sus bebés, ordénalas, ordénalas, estoy ordeñando a mis mujeres".
However, the post, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has sparked a great deal of controversy.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions of all kinds, where many say it brings the focus to the horrors of the dairy industry.
A very unfortunate decision to put cows to announce this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, with the exception that they have to take their babies away from them days after they give birth.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly attached to a nursing mother's bra.
Another mother commented: "Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, why not use them to announce a breast milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: “How dare you make such a big announcement?”

Spanish: 
However, others defended the announcement, such as a woman who admitted that the song was “hilarious”.
I think it's a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd probably have one.
Using the pump, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but I don't give it more thought.
It's a genius product.
Another person was commenting: “It's a funny ad directed at mothers who use a breast pump (at times in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
In the commercial, there is no mention of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs inside their bras.
The campaign is based on the perception that many women who use the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and discreetly fits inside the breastfeeding suit, making its users move, hold on to their babies, and even get out and walk with the pump in operation.
The Elvie Pump is a product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between a woman expressing herself and cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and its challenges, while also demonstrating the incredible sensation of freedom that comes with the new breast pump.
This is not the first time that the Elvie bomb has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two kids walked the runway for the designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Centenars of illegal immigrants discreetly crossed the border into Texas.
The number of illegal immigrants detained has experienced a dramatic increase, despite the monthly flow of illegal immigrants into the border area having remained at the usual levels.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors, who were also illegal immigrants in their day, feared that the proposal to host a child would put their own stay in the country in jeopardy.
This risk increased in June, when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other family members of theirs should present their fingerprints and data would be shared with immigration authorities.
The week before, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the U.S. Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had offered to sponsor children who had come to the U.S. without their parents.
The agency confirmed after the arrested had no criminal records.
The vast majority of sponsors or their relatives are illegal immigrants, and a large percentage of them are criminals.
We are still pursuing these people,” said Albence.
In their pursuit to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court in a maximum of one month from the time of their arrest, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to workers at the children's homes.
Many of them will testify by video conferencing, rather than in person, to defend their legal status in immigration proceedings.
Those who are not eligible for amnesty will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers at the shelters and the reports from the system that have come out in the last few months, as long as they are held under custody, the greater the chance that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the supporters, these concerns increase as the size of the facility increases, where it is more likely that, due to its size, the staff will overlook signs of distress in these children.
The children are being transported to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends.
If Syria requests that the occupation forces of the United States, France and Turkey withdraw immediately.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, also asked Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces in Syria were illegally in the country under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue “will be dealt with in consequence”.
“We must immediately and without conditions retire from the assembly.”
Moualem asserted that the “terrorist war in Syria is practically over,” with more than 360,000 people dying and millions being displaced since 2011.
He said that Syria would continue to fight in this holy battle until we purge all the Syrian territories from terrorist groups as well as any foreign presence that is unlawful in Syria.
United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily providing training and advising Arab and Kurdish forces that are fighting against Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this devastated country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said there were the conditions for them to return and blamed “some countries in the West” for “raising fears that made them stay away from the country.”
“We have requested international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns.”
“They are politicizing the issue of humanitarian aid.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major escalation of the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had clear “shorts” and has expressed the hope that the military action will be focused on the yihadists, including the fighters of the Front Nusra (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will be “eradicated”.
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, is expected to call for the first meeting of a new UN committee composed of members of the Syrian government and opposition to draft a new constitution for the country and to prepare the way for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the participation of Syria's government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, even if, as many liberal observers expect, a scandal or a final end to his presidency will prematurely end his presidency.
This would be the most dramatic end to a presidential term ever seen!
The audience is not showing signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings reached 1.05 million for CNN and 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2,4 million viewers in the 8 p.m. hour, compared with the 1,7 million viewers in the same time slot four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” of MSNBC has surpassed cable news channels with 3.5 million viewers for its main evening news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still haven’t understood”, says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor”, a dramatic series on a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran playwright and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club”, has another theory.
I remember a trip in a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Because I'm a little bit jealous of the sun.
“Because it makes me laugh”, was the reply that he received.
Chaos is always rising in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disengaging is a luxury that only the most privileged can afford.
However, the information exceeds the limits when you realize that you’ve been watching six hours of expert debate about the use of “deep background” that Woodward used to write his book “Fear”, the furry coat of 15,000 dollars that Paul Manafort (“a pride of dismay”, in words of The Washington Post) and the disturbing descriptions of Trump’s anatomy.
In the end, I never will see Mario again in the same way.
“We offer something new each night, it’s part of what makes it a reality show”, says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars”, when he talks about the cast alternate of the show of Trump and its daily turmoil.

When I met Mr. Fleiss last week, the weather was a bit cooler than 27 degrees in the North Coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC and CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when in those days we did all those crazy things of programs and people said that this was the end of the West’s civilization.

The money flowed into the House elections of half-term most closely contested election in the House.
It's not a surprise that money is pouring into the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates that are seeking reelection for the same seat.
This Pittsburgh district, which has been redrawn recently, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election in the spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for reelection, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th Pennsylvania district, a district that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a financial battle between the top two campaign financing arms of the parties, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the National Republican Committee (NRC).
The name of Lamb was very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
This seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, but after backing down, they did so.
The diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the team of management of the Trump Organization was evicted.
The State Department decided to send back their ambassadors to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, due to recent decisions to leave Taiwan.
But only El Salvador was punished, which had already received a grant of around 140 million dollars from the United States in 2017 to, among other things, control drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to foreign aid and visa restrictions, would have been very painful for the country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the talks continued, officials at the high level did not hold a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity as they did the year before, when the two nations' leaders met for the first time in nearly a decade.
But in mid-September, the top officials in the administration clearly stated that their intention was that the conference would continue, and that they would not consider any sanctions against El Salvador.
The vice president Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and is seen as a sign of the administration's importance of the meeting.
The three American diplomats returned safely to the United States, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new threats or punishments from Washington.
Un portavoz of the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American diplomats, including two ambassadors, who agreed to keep the discussions under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst, who also spoke under oath.
The study of history.
The next step would be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there are compelling public records.
It is believed that Mueller is also investigating whether the Trump campaign worked with Russia in their attack on our elections.
If the House changes hands, Trump will be facing the House, and he will be forced to answer to that chamber, just as he is preparing to run for re-election, and perhaps even before that.
This is a lot of conditional, and with it I don't suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor the equivalents in Europe.
We will have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the war.
In 1938, German officers were ready to give a coup against Hitler. Just waiting for the West to stand up and resist him and his army.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world is a series of turning points, and the march of democracy is a series of accelerating and delaying points.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good one since this newspaper reported that he had suggested secretly to record the president and had speculated that he was unfit for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times' explanation is wrong.
“How will we respond if the new F.B.I. request investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if his confirmation to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony,”
And, of course, there is the question of the election of the House and the Senate in November.
If we fail these tests, we'll be stuck in a long winter for democracy.
But, because of the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we won't fail.
My mother was a Czech Jewish woman deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once had occupied my house as an ambassador.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with an SS symbol.
With that legacy, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans, a Rangers optimist ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers will play their home game on Thursday against the Austrian Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against the Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify in the Group G of the UEFA Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 1-1 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to things bigger.
“We managed to get a good point, because Villarreal is a good team.”
We started the game believing we could do something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have won the game at the end, but, in general, the draw was a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out to play our best and we were the best team.
This Thursday we'll have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve a win, but it will be a tough game because they got a good result in the last game. But, with all the fans supporting us, I'm sure we can advance and obtain a positive result.
The year last year was definitely a rough one for me and the changes at the club, but now it's a much better atmosphere.
The team is feeling great, the kids are enjoying themselves and they are having a great training.
I have the hope that we can overcome the past season and achieve success.
The fear of retirement savings is making women sleep worried.
Even though participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, they are few who talk about it with their families.
About half of those who participated in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of parents said they talked to their children about sex.
“People want to be cared for by a relative, but they don’t give the conversation the steps to have this conversation.”
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare your family to look after you if you don't express your wishes with enough time.
Work with your healthcare provider and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as that can be a factor in the cost.
Incorporate your financial advisor, as he or she can help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
His options for long-term care can include a traditional insurance policy, a life insurance policy with cash value, or a hybrid long-term care insurance policy with cash value.
Legal documents: be ahead of the battles.
Have a medical power of attorney designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals comply with your wishes in case you can't communicate.
You can also prepare a power of attorney for your finances.
Select a trusted person to take financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your checks are paid if you become disabled.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer the questions about medicine and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you always have it ready.
“Are there only the finances at stake?: What about the doctors?” asks Martin.
“What medications are you taking?”
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned out.
A man is shot with a rifle in Ilfracombe.
A man has been shot multiple times with a rifle while walking home after a night out.
The victim, a man of around 40 years, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (British time), as an “accidental” shooting.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have made a plea for possible witnesses.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu on Friday, according to the Indonesian government.
With communications blocked, officials of assistance have not been able to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, a northern area of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay in the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The region has a population of 299,200 people.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but they are concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a massive tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region with a high level of seismic activity.
The following is a list of some of the most destructive earthquakes and earthquakes in recent history.
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of Aceh province in North Sumatra, Indonesia, on December 26, 2004, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coast of the Indian Ocean.
A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of deaths in the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A major earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the south of Java, the island's most populous, and caused a tsunami that killed almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the island of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a massive tsunami that killed hundreds and destroyed hundreds of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing panic and destruction to remember the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The island tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and millions of tourists were evacuated temporarily.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, and his wife, Kristin, were arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the state police report published Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known person tried to call the police to report a crime, he took the phone away from her.
A Palin seizure order is issued in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and she is held with a $500 no-bond guarantee.
He was presented before the court, where he denied all wrongdoing when asked to give his statement.
Palin is facing three misdemeanor charges of Class A, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a misdemeanor Class B, with a maximum sentence of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report a purported assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence complaint, and possessing a firearm in a drunken state, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend said that he had given her a punch in the face.
Various veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking the behavior of her son with the PTSD derived from her service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths.
At least 384 people died after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power grid and communications networks have all collapsed and are expected to collapse in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just outside the Sulawesi center, which is located in the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social media and show the moment of impact.
Centenars of people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek unusual punishment for suspected terrorist in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare federal sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
The suspect, a man named Devin Saipov, was arrested in Florida.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed “intentionally” eight people and caused “intentionally” serious bodily injury, according to the intention of the request for capital punishment, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
The federal grand jury filed a 22-count indictment against Saipov, who was charged with eight counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder.
The attack required a plan and premeditated substantial planning, according to the prosecution, which described the attack as “atrocious, cruel and depraved”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, a resident of Brooklyn, New York, was charged with terrorism and murder.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The last time the South Bronx had a capital punishment case was in the early '90s.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately convicted of murder in September 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty was carried out in a federal case was in 1953. This couple was executed after being convicted of espionage charges two years before.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electrocution on June 19, 1953.
Terrorist Ilham Omar Saipov, who carried out the attack, has a history of violent behavior.
According to police, he said he felt well and that he had done something good.
The accused told authorities he was inspired by ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the flag of ISIS be flown in his room at the hospital.
He was found guilty of 22 counts of rape and sexual abuse.
David Patton, one of the federal public defender lawyers who represent Saipov, said they were “deeply disappointed” with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea with a sentence of life without possibility of release, only prolongs the trauma of these events for all the people involved.”
The defense team of the shooter who shot the Pulse nightclub had previously requested that the death penalty be denied.
Member of Parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should be the UK's chief negotiator with the EU
Farage promised to mobilize the popular army today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The UKIP leader said that politicians should “feel the heat” of the Eurosceptics, while one of the MPs of Theresa May suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK would have already left the EU if Farage had been Foreign Secretary.
But the challenge facing the First Minister Theresa May to reconcile her divided Tory ranks has highlighted yet more when a group of Tories in favour of the Remain protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Brexit deal in place, despite the attacks of the pro-Remain and pro-EU opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted on trying to reach a deal with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the pro-European parties and the Labour Party to choose between their plan and chaos.
The MP said in the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the plan of Chequers.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a role in the talks with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already left.”
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I will defend the Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers”.
In his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejected suggestions that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British public has changed its mind and wants to stay in the European Union is completely false.”
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also was at the protest, where she said to the reporters: “Only one thing: First Minister, listen to the people.”
The public at large does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular with our activists, who are the ones who actually vote for us first.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.
The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they make their promises.
Farage said to the crowd that it would be good to make them “feel the heat” if they saw that politicians were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
Now it's a question of trust between us, the people, and our classical political class.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to say to them that we won’t let them get away with it”.
In a message to the crowd, he said: “We want you to make our class political, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.”
“We will mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proudly independent country.”
While the pro-Remain rally was taking place, the Leave campaigners marched through Birmingham's city centre.
Some activists on the Tory side of the debate waving Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's presentation this weekend.
The Labour leader Lord Adonis joked about the Conservative Party's security problems during the opening of the conference.
“These are the same people who tell us they can implement computer systems and all the technology to Canada Plus Plus, to the harmony of border in harmony, to the free trade without borders in Ireland.”
“It's a total hoax.”
There is no good Brexit.
Warren considers all possible options for the presidency.
Senator Warren says she will consider all options for 2020.
The Boston Globe reports that Democratic candidate Martha Coakley spoke about her future during a municipal meeting in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the state representative, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation that Warren will challenge Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with the voters using the municipal format since he assumed the presidency.
A question was asked to him as to whether he would be a candidate for the presidency.
Warren responded that it's time for women to go to Washington to fix our unregulated government, and that includes having a woman in the highest office.
A man arrested for the murder with a firearm of LSU football player Sims.
The police of Baton Rouge (Louisiana) announced this Saturday that they have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player who was shot dead last Friday.
The department arrested Dyteon Simpson, 20, in a news conference at 11:00 am.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead at the university campus around 5:30 am Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury that eventually caused his death”, said the chief of police Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde was defending a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was detained by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Simms, a native of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, played in 32 games last season, starting in 10 of them, and had a 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game average.
Grand Prix of Russia: Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders gave him win over Vettel.
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team's orders would be important in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and almost forgotten Hamilton by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting him to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the pits and let Hamilton run in the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out with force a lap later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a near-close action that made him lose the inside free space.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, began from the last row of the grid and ended up in seventh place at the end of the first lap.
After leading a large part of the race while holding on to his tyres to achieve a quick and quick exit and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered the pits in the 44th lap, but could not increase his pace in the last eight laps to recover fourth place.
It has been a difficult day because Valtteri made a fantastic job all week and was a real gentleman by letting me pass.
The team has done a great job in making a perfect pair.
That was a really bad body language.
The president Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she did not leak the Christine Blasey Ford letter in which she accused Brett Kavanaugh of rape.
In a speech in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he did say that what was going on in the Senate showed that there was “mala, repugnant and false people”.
“The only thing that could happen and what is happening these last days in the Senate, is when you see the rage, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false.”
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then you say “But if I did not do it.
I didn't do it.
You remember it?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remembered his answer... Did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
No, not at all.
I didn't leak it.
Good, wait a minute.
We have leaked it, we have leaked it, we have leaked it.
A Feinstein letter sent to Kavanaugh detailing the allegations against him was sent to Ford in July and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I did not conceal the allegations of the Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and, therefore, I kept it confidential.”
But his refusal certainly didn't sit well with the president, who during the rally of the night said the following: “That was a bad body language”.
I don't know if he didn't do it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing with his defense of the nominee to the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see evil and repugnance, they don't care who they hurt, they only have to crush and destroy to get power and control.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee.
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday in the Elite League by beating the Belfast Giants 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants scored two early goals through the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the tie before Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before he scored twice to secure his team's win.
This has been the third defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had previously beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast last night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the three previous games.
The first goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute (3:35) with an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead.
In the first period, the team that was on the road was the one that was in the lead.
Dwyer secured a two-goal lead before the first break.
The local team re-grouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Corcoran combined to help Dundee lead for the first time in the game and secure the win with the fifth goal of their team as they neared the end of the second half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game.
A controller dies to save hundreds of people from the plane of a quake.
A controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after dying in a successful attempt to ensure that an airliner carrying hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, causing a massive tsunami.
The strong earthquakes are still going on and many are trapped in the city of Palu.
Despite his fellow passengers fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the airport control tower.
He kept his head up and kept his eyes on the runway to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air could safely take off.
After landing, he thought the building was falling down.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian aviation authority said the crash was caused by a technical failure in the aircraft's engine.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Later this morning, a helicopter carrying a search and rescue team from the United States Air Force crashed in the mountains of Papua, Indonesia.
Our hearts break when we hear this.
While the death toll is yet to be determined, officials fear that the number of deaths could reach several thousand people.
“We believe that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the rubble and it is still not possible to reach out to many people,” says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
A wave that reached six meters has devastated Palu, which is scheduled to hold a mass burial on Sunday.
The help and supplies are being flown in by military and commercial planes.
Risa Kusuma, a mother of 35, said to Sky News: “Each minute comes a ambulance with more bodies.
Water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross is trying to help all survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but could have been much worse.
Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the army: “We’re all working day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in the first half of this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the crash of a plane in a lake.
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed in a lake in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared after having said that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that a passenger was missing from a flight from Port Moresby to Port Moresby.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline declined to comment on the passenger's identity.
The local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the island of Chuuk.
The seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital and all were in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events still remain unclear.
The plane landed in a lake that is located before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had landed on the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
“It’s a great thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes says he and other travellers managed to make it to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
The pilot said that the flight attendants entered into a panic and shouted, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The United States Navy said that its sailors who were doing some work on a dock also helped in the rescue by using a boat inflatable to carry people to shore before the plane sank some 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
The data of the aviation safety network indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but no one with Air Niugini.
A researcher presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution finished its arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of murdering a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst from the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
Exposed in court was the way he used the mobile phone records to tie the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting his earlier statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis said the truth when he said he was in the car with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was lying, because his car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The records of your mobile phones indicated that they met only a week before.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis erased the messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers' phone.
“He wiped her out of his life”, said Hale.
The defense will begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be completed that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A trio of hip-hop artists want to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of hip-hop.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop has strayed from its original messages of political and social commentary.
They want to return to their roots and make hip hop conscious again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after she wrote a racist text.
A New York nanny sues a couple for wrongful dismissal after receiving a text from the mother complaining that she was “another black person”.
The couple denies being racist and compares the suit to a case of “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two kids, expressed her shock at discovering that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO OTRA PERSONA NEGRA”, wrote the Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to his husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After discovering his mistake, a Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, saying that his previous nanny, who was black, had done a bad job and that he was looking for a Filipina nanny.
Mauricio received his pay for a day's work and sent it to his home in Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with intent to receive a $350 per day salary for six months of work that was not a contract.
“I want to show them that things don’t happen like that”, said the man to The Post and added that “I know it’s a discrimination case”.
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, as they feared she would not be able to trust her after having offended them.
“My wife sent something she didn’t want to say.”
She is not racist.
We're not racists,” said husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone who has been rude to you, even though it was an error?”

Spanish: 
Do you have a new baby?
“Hello!”

Spanish: 
Comparing the demand as an “extortion”, Plasco said his wife had given birth two months earlier and that she was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Do you want to go out with him?”

Spanish: 
That's not a decent thing to do.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion has already begun to condemn the couple in social media, criticizing their behavior and their logic.
The editors of Paddington Bear feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter.
The daughter of Ian Fleming, Karen Jankel, who was born a few weeks after the book was accepted, said: “It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who read the book for the first time before its publication.
It's funny to know now what we know about the success of Paddington”.
After saying that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he inspired himself to write the book for children, trusted that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something “agridulce” after his death last year.
Dear father, I am very proud of you.
“He was a very quiet man and he didn’t like to be in the spotlight.”
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who did something important: you’re proud of him, even though it wasn’t really his own achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
On landing, his daughter was transferred to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he didn’t expect to make it.”
“After receiving the call from Nad to say she was dying in two minutes, I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did it.
I said: “Tashi, I love you, dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given him to keep his heart beating slowly and steadily wore out and left him with a weak heart.
She had died before time and everything was fading.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that everything was happening.
I couldn't howl, cry, or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand up to him.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering for the loss of her daughter, embarked on the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was about to endure.
“No one knew it”, said.
I was crying and crying and crying.
It's difficult to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.
Women in mourning put cards to prevent suicides is a bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, the son of the Mrs. Davis, had 13 years when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day.”
Davis, 45, and his son, a chef, were both from Lydney, and they were both very happy to have a picture taken together.
All knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened any place.
However, he left work before dying, as he was “in a place really dark”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had committed suicide.
The Mrs. Davis said: “I’m always concerned that it might have repercussions.”
Davis created the cards to make sure people know that there are people to whom you can call and who can help you if you need it.
Don't be silent, you have to speak it.
The Mrs. Humphreys, who is Davies' friend since years, lost her partner Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years, after the death of her mother.
“He was just saying that he wasn’t feeling like he was going to be a good father.
“About a week before Christmas, he noticed his attitude had changed.
Christmas Day is the lowest point of the year: when children opened their gifts, he didn't even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to overcome it: “Leave a void in everyone’s family.
He has left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought we could get something like what I was asking (a limited time, scope limited investigation), perhaps we could bring a little bit of unity,” said the Senator Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going to sink” in the middle of a partisan impasse.
Why Kavanaugh and his conservative allies did not want the FBI to investigate Trump?
His refusal is due to the chronology.
The election of the court's chief justice is due in November. If Republicans have a bad showing, their efforts to secure the election of the man they want to be the chief justice of the nation will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling on senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the President.
What happens when the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
The confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh is still uncertain, but Pence could break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Numbers of defectors from North Korea “fall” with Kim Jong-un.
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said there were 1,127 desertions in 2012, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by human traffickers, have been the key factors.
North Korea has not made any public statements about the incident.
The vast majority of deserters from the north are offered South Korean citizenship.
South Korean authorities say that 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally from 1953 to the present.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the DMZ.
China sees refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and, with some frequency, repatriates them.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in war, have improved markedly in the last months.
The leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in early May to have talks that focused on the nuclear disarmament process.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between the president of the United States Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general to work for a peaceful and nuclear-free Korea.
But the North Korean Foreign Minister blamed the United States' sanctions for the lack of progress.
“With the trust of the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, of no means will we be the first to disarm unilaterally,” said Ri in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls him “hysterical” and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader of the House, said that the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a “histrionic” and that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
I've been a member of the House of Representatives for over 30 years.
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said that she was a histrion.
Kavanaugh served up the emotion to deny the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when she was a teenager.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, in some cases almost screaming and choking while speaking of his family and his years of education.
In the committee, also condemned explicitly the Democrats, accusing them of “diffamatory grotesque and clearly coordinated” attacks on the Clinton family.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, the testimony of Kavanaugh showed that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because he showed partiality against Democrats.
“I think he’s self-destructive with that kind of statement and the way he’s pursued the Clinton and the Democrats.”
Pelosi put her objections when she was asked if she would challenge Kavanaugh in the case he was confirmed in the Senate and if the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“Only one thing: if he is lying to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court in which he is now sitting.”
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh's rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Case Roe against Wade, which she considers to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a non-partisan, non-biased court to go to and say, ‘This is all right,’” said Pelosi.
Women have to hold it.
It's a diatribe that's justified, months and years of rage unleashed, and she can't stop crying without crying.
“We cry when we angry”, said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s so unusual, do you?”
I followed talking: “I was helped by a woman who was an executive in some company and she told me that she too cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique by which when she cried and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was talking: “Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.
And then I was doing something else.
I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed as a way to express rage in part because they're not understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of my first job, in a man-dominated office, was once when I found myself crying with a rage unexpressable. A woman older, a manager who was always a little bit fearsome to me, grabbed me by the nape of my neck and dragged me up the stairs.
“Don’t let them ever see you cry,” he said.
You're furious because I'm not going to marry you.
They believe you're sad and will be happy when they think you're being cornered.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up in a extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business by which he had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea of exploring the idea of her running for the presidency.
“It wasn’t premeditated,” he said 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was a candidate more.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
The campaign was already well behind in fundraising, so he was not going to enter the race again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who gave 1,000 dollars to him, he only received 250 dollars from them.
“Do you think I have a discount?” asked.
When she announced that she would not be running for the presidency, she was overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise funds and to get delegates, and rage at sexism).
“It was a very difficult decision to make,” said Schroeder.
“You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be on my tombstone?
“¿Lloró?”
The war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing.
The first round of trade war between the United States and China were loud and unexpected, and though the battle is still ongoing, a breakdown could benefit Beijing.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, made the first warning of the year by threatening to impose tariffs on the top three exports from China, namely solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant new tax increase this week was a 50% increase on 200,000 million dollars (150,000 million pounds) of imports, which charges half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
Beijing has taken retaliatory measures, applying a five to ten percent tariff on U.S. goods for a value of $60 billion.
China has committed to matching the attacks of the U.S., and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be willing to give up on the challenge.
China's Xi Jinping is not going to be intimidated by the United States.
Beijing is still trying to play both sides of the fence, trying to maintain a balance between the United States and the rest of the world.
The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the economy crash in either of those two countries is in reality much more dangerous than the audience has recognized up to now.
If Syria is ready to accept refugees, then the world is ready to accept refugees.
If Syria is to be rebuilt, it will take a lot of help.
The conditions in the country are improving.
The situation on the ground is today more stable and secure than it was when I visited last year.
The government is still rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normalcy.
The conditions are now there to allow the refugees to return voluntarily to the country.
The UN estimates that, since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still six million people left in the country and they need humanitarian aid.
The Syrian government would be grateful if the U.S. provided them with help to rebuild the country.
But he also said he would not accept a conditional aid or the aid of the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the American team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now six consecutive defeats in Europe since the last time they won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team from Denmark's Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight through most of the tournament, threw his point of departure into the water at the 16th hole, admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari finished his rounds with a 5-0-0, the first to do so since 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell to the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest-ranked player in the team.
The number one player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The European with most Ryder Cup victories is Sergio García, with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't cry often, but today I can't avoid it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to recover the trophy.
It's a triumph for the whole team and I'm so proud of my teammates.
Now it's Rahm's turn to pass the torch to his compatriot John, who already beat the legendary Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a singles match.
I feel a tremendous pride to have beaten Tiger Woods, as I grew up watching him.
Woods lost four of the five matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his career of the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, leaving only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight hard to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a great level of golf during the entire tournament.
The American captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance of his team: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never given up.
There was a time this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we ruin it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Their 12 players have played a good game.
We will re-unite, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will continue on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now we have to bend our heads.
They have overtaken us.
Actualization of the red tide: Disminutions in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota.
The new report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission) shows a reduction in the concentrations of red tide in areas of the Bay of Tampa.
According to the FWC, there are reports of irregular bloom in areas of the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which suggests a reduction in concentrations.
The bloom of the red tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from the county of Pinellas in the north to the county of Lee in the south.
There are irregularly shaped plots of land in Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than the week before.
The marine life in the county of Pasco has also been affected by the bloom.
During the week of June 1, 2011, there have been a number of reports of concentrations in the Pinellas County and its coast, concentrations between low and moderate in the Hillsborough County coast, concentrations of the low to moderate range in the Manatee County coast, concentrations of the moderate to high range in the Sarasota County coast, concentrations of the moderate to high range in the Charlotte County coast, concentrations of the moderate to high range in the Lee County coast, and concentrations of the moderate to high range in the Collier County coast.
The current report shows that there are no new cases of the flu in Florida.
No respiratory problems have been reported in the northwest of Florida during the past week.
