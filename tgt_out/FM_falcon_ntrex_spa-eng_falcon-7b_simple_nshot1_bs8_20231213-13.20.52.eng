The members of the Assembly of Wales (AM, for its acronym in English) are worried about “looking like muppets”
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament for Wales (MPW, for its acronym in English).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly of Wales to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party declared that his group was worried about "being left with Twp and Pwp".
For the readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member of the Assembly of the Welsh Party commented that all his group was "dissatisfied" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said that his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that the jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the change of name, declares: “Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves.”
In 2017, the Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which revealed widespread support for calling the National Assembly for Wales to Parliament.
On the question of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the option MWP got the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring down the president of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who would have to send the bill on the proposed changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will have the last word in the question of how they should be called when they decide on the legislation.
The Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum about the change of name of the country
The electors will vote on Sunday on whether the name of their country will be changed to “Republic of Macedonia of the North”.
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent due to the difficulties of the churches of Harlem.
“Historically, the people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.”
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods to which the residents go regularly.”
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that “in the end, they will return to the starting point”.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the type of people who won't help the shelters that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and, therefore, they will accelerate the closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in the Fields in 1880.
The original white Methodist congregation disappeared in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped in the building acquired the building.
A black congregation took control of St. Martin's, under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were resisting the hiring or promotion of black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building gravely damaged and, while the parishioners of Father Johnson were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of the Father Johnson in San Martín, was proud to call his campaigns “the campaigns of the poor”.
In July, the expert who was playing the carillon called it: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church carillon, the largest one, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martín did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the rector of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on their concern that the diocese “try to pass the costs” to the parish, although the parish council had not participated in the contracting of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was bitten by a shark while diving for abalone off the coast of California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on Saturday, the first day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child calling for help, so he swam over with a group to rescue him.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about having captured a lobster, but then he realized that “he was screaming that he had been bitten
He had a broken clavicle”, observed Hammel when he arrived at the boy’s side.
“I shouted to all of them to get out of the water because there was a shark,” added Hammel.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in a critical condition.
No one knows the species of shark responsible for the attack.
The rescuer, the Captain Larry Giles, commented in a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic lesions in the upper part of the chest.
The authorities closed the access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, to Swami's Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's are pushing the beauty market of the United Kingdom.
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the aisles of their style and beauty stores.
In order to significantly stimulate the beauty market in the United Kingdom, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with a growth that is increasing in comparison with the fall in sales of fashion and household goods, the largest beauty halls will be put to the test in 11 shops across the country and, if they succeed, will be repeated in more shops the following year.
The investment in beauty arrives at the same time that this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's declared that they would double their offer of beauty products with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup line with a majority of animal-friendly products, something that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, in the perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will try out its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, in the south of London, last week. The second will open in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
The rise of online shopping and the shift towards buying small quantities of food in local shops means that supermarkets have to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that Sainsbury's stores will look more and more like shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount stores into hundreds of its stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered that this has boosted food sales and has made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt of the chain of supermarkets to renew their beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over how to divide the profits from the sale of pharmaceutical products in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of the 281 pharmacies of Sainsbury to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a wider range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to create an environment that enhances the shopping experience for our customers."
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our offer of trademarks is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, went “furious” after Holly Willoughby broke a 11 million pound contract with his lifestyle business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to devote to the fashion brand and accessories Truly.
This business had been compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the girl of gold of the television admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate to Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday in the head office of his business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double the fortune of Willoughby, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, aged 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
According to a source consulted: "Truly it was, by far, the main priority of Holly."
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
His decision to abandon the project left everyone involved totally stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise in the Marlow headquarters, ready to be put on the market.
Experts believe that the exit of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes, and, possibly, delay its launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 % stake in the television production company of Baldwin.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here on the ITV channel.
A source close to Jones said that last night “we didn’t talk about business.”
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Why has President Trump renounced so many things?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of a “news presenter”.
“I haven’t renounced anything.”
He pointed out that Kim is interested in meeting Trump again after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, the principal diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate” response from the United States to its first steps towards denuclearization.
On the other hand, he said, the United States continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
The prospect of Trump was much more optimistic in the speech that he gave during his rally.
“We had a great time with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.”
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: the end of missile tests, help for the release of hostages and the return of the remains of U.S. soldiers killed in action.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach to speaking about his relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but this way, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was reported to foreign non-governmental organizations that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, there was no declaration of a national emergency, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” says Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will be sent to Palu, they still don't know if the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if it would be allowed for international organizations to provide aid.
Taking into account that the earth moves constantly in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami refuges have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a warning in advance, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, travelling from one island of Indonesia to another is quite a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo turned the improvement of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure into the central axis of his electoral campaign, and has allocated quite a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is facing a reelection next year.
In addition, he must face the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim community have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim bands fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from the Liverpool, equalizes the score against the Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved the Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against the Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri that was about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He kicked the ball with his left foot before placing it on the second post.
The action went over the area and headed towards the upper right corner of the grid.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to parry it with a jump and fell into the net.
“I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kante was approaching and I gave him a tap. I didn’t think too much about it, I just threw the ball.”
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The half-punt of the Blues made a pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning and making a dribble near the middle of the field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran quickly in the middle of the field.
After that, he made a nice pass to Hazard, who took the ball into the area.
Hazard positioned himself in front of the defense and shot the ball into the net with a left-footed shot that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
The Wednesday at 15:00, the Liverpool plays against the Napoli in the phase of groups of the Champions League. The match will be celebrated in the San Paolo Stadium, in Naples (Italy).
On the other hand, Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832.
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's disaster management agency at first light on Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of the buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and that triggered waves of up to six meters, according to the spokesman of the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder of a woman after she was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, in Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, in John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect for murder.
The police have urged people in the area who may have seen or heard something to contact the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who may have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us."
In addition, I would like to recommend to any person, especially to taxi drivers, to contact us if they have been able to capture something in dashcam, because they can have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found in the interior of a property.
Some people who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is in progress and the police have informed that they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that no one can get in or out of the building.
He was perplexed when he discovered what had happened.
Now, it is reported that residents will be allowed to return to their homes in a few hours.
Someone heard a police officer tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
He doesn't stop repeating "it's terrible".
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained inside the cordon, controlling the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police on DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, reference 247 of 30th September.
The statue of Cromwell in the House of Commons becomes the last commemorative success by “rewriting history”
His prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects and sites in England carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestions of Mr. Crick as a "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become a target.”
The iconoclasm of the civil wars in England was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
It is possible that Thomas Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas Cromwell, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out in The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than at present, a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate description, then it's a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has given shape to the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A killer pig attacks a Chinese farmer.
A pig attacked and killed a herdsman in a market in the southwest of China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his last name Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, as the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that there was a great pig with blood in its mouth in the pigsty.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig weighing almost 250 kg had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“The legs of my cousin were bloody and broken”, declared the cousin, who goes by the surname Wu, to The Guiyang Evening News.
Images from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40pm on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong either to Yuan or to his cousin.
A manager of the market told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It seems that the family of Yuan and the authorities of the market are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time that a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man gravely injured.
Ten years before, a pig weighing almost 295 kilos cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After some pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs aren't usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "disparator".
“They’re just playing.”
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to do harm.
What we need to do is to treat them with the respect that they deserve.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rains in the southwest of the U.S.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern Mexican coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the U.S. in the next few days.
Rosa caused gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, from Sunday at 5:00 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) and was located about 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move towards the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low-pressure systems are starting to form, which are moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will start to push the intense tropical rains northward, towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical downpour clashes with the low pressure system that is approaching, there will be widespread heavy precipitation in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible rockfalls in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause precipitation of almost 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to receive between 5 and 10 inches of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in the greater part of Arizona.
Due to the dispersive nature of tropical rains, it is possible that floods may occur suddenly with conditions that worsen rapidly.
Due to the threat of torrential tropical rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
The strong rains could turn the cannons into raging rivers and the storms could cause whirlwinds and local dust storms.
The low pressures that are approaching will leave strong rains in specific parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible that the torrential rains could leave up to two inches of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make the roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains of the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before becoming widespread by late Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and all of Wednesday.
In October, some intense changes in temperature will be observed in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this can mean drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these differences in temperature is what will happen in the center of the U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and, Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of the summer will attempt to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the United States, it is expected that the beginning of October will be warm, with general temperatures that will range from 26 degrees Celsius in the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates above-average temperatures for the eastern half of the U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's testimony.
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, as they gave their testimonies on Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political situation was at a standstill, and the media interrupted their usual programming to broadcast the latest news from Friday: a deal designed by the senator from Arizona, Jeff Blake, for the FBI to carry out an investigation for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her in high school and tried to take off her clothes.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was completely sure that that hadn't happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who Nielsen mentioned on Friday have seen it.
The company calculated the audience share for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems to calculate how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it's like an American football playoff game or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, averaged 5,69 million viewers during a hearing that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC occupied the second place, with 3,26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3,1 millones, the NBC had 2,94 millones, the MSNBC had 2,89 millones and the CNN had 2,52 millones, said Nielsen.
After the hearing, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican released a statement saying that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at Kavanaugh as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Judicial Committee.
While receiving these reproaches, retransmitted in real time by CNN, he appeared dejected.
“Looking me in the face”, said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?”
And he continued: "You have power when there are so many women who don't have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a press release and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say in his appearance before the Commission.
The cable and radio stations broadcast everything in real time hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to propose the candidacy of Kavanaugh to the Senate to vote on it.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, the Democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake took his decision.
The decision of Flake was fundamental, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation of the FBI regarding the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, accuses her critics of "playing politics" with Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the future of Britain and of undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
The first British prime minister, Theresa May, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference that will be held in Birmingham (United Kingdom) on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, claiming that a proposal for the UK and the EU to collect the other’s tariffs was “totally absurd”.
Assassination of Wayde: the police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and jailed for a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made public a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said that they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After interrogating Simpson, the police say that he admitted to having shot Wayde.
A bail bond of $350,000 has been set, according to the defense.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck that had traveled to the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the Louisiana State Police, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's director of athletics, thanked the local police for their diligence and search for justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was more than 2 meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that his team is "devastated" and "shocked" by the death of Wayde Sims.
“These are the things that people always worry about”, said Wade.
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash into the air.
Volcanic ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Prevention of Disasters warned the Mexican people to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center registered several tremors and quakes.
In the social networks, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers to the southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The police are facing separatists in Catalonia before the anniversary of the independence referendum.
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after anti-riot police clashed with pro-independence demonstrators as tens of thousands of people took part in rival protests marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's divisive independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the police, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally full of tourists.
There were also confrontations later in the evening and the police used truncheons to contain the fight.
During several hours, the independentist groups, with messages like “no forget, no forgive”, faced the unionists, shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1, 2017 referendum, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters overwhelmingly chose for independence, although the turnout was low, as many people who were against the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at polling stations throughout the region, where there were violent confrontations.
The pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year was one of our best moments.”
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are stuck.”
Despite achieving a vital victory in regional elections last December, the procatalanist parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in exile or under house arrest, are awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense”, he declared.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections in 2019.
“To be a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for ramming a house with a car.
Three men, aged 33, 34, and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday, around 7:30 p.m., in Ballynagard Crescent.
The inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there had been damage to the accesses and to the building itself.
At some point, it is possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured the victory.
A Livingston promoted player impressed the Rangers by securing the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's team went up a place, with Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard's team have yet to win a game away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points' advantage.
Before, the Rangers receive the Rapid Viena on Thursday in the Europa League.
While that was going on, Livingston extended its winning streak to six games in the division.
Livingston missed several opportunities in front of a tough opponent.
Holt's team should have gone a step ahead much earlier, causing all sorts of problems for Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defense, but missed his shot in front of the goal. After that, Alan Lithgow's shot was deflected after he had entered the area to head the ball in front of the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with the ball at their feet.
That's how the decisive goal arrived.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston looked for an entry, with a combined play of Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that moment, Rangers dominated the possession, but they couldn't pass the defense of the host and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
This game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Allan McGregor, goalkeeper of Rangers, rejected a shot by Scott Pittman with a kick, and Lithgow was far away from another play of Livingston.
In the Livingston area there were long passes constantly, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one after a Halkett run on the substitute Glenn Middleton and the other after a handball.
“Fenomenal” of Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A fantastic performance and a great result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an upward trajectory.
His style of play and his squad have hardly changed since his promotion, but this is largely down to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was huge and directed a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some very good moments with Gerrard, they were short-lived.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to enter the opponent's field once, which is a call to attention to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Colonia
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of the Turkish President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring the relations between the allies of NATO.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Colonia to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers showed up in the vicinity to see their president.
Also, hundreds of opponents of Erdogan were heard, many of them Kurds, who condemned both the policies of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German-speaking Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
A traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle.
A cyclist has been killed in a car accident in London.
The accident happened near the junction of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road to the east of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended to by the paramedics, but he died there and then.
The accident happened after another cyclist was killed after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene in Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that the agents were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and it has been advised to drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six agents injured after disturbances
Six prison officers have been injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the director of the prison.
The disturbances started in the prison of Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and still continue.
A team of elite specialists (called “Tornado”) is in charge of controlling the fights, in which eight inmates are involved, and which affect a pavilion.
The agents received assistance for minor facial injuries at the location.
A spokesman for the prison service says: "Specialist staff have been deployed to deal with the incident at Long Lartin prison."
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.”
The Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had received medical assistance after a prisoner had attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, it was requested that riot police be sent to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which the prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (arid regions could benefit)
It's unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen at the beginning of next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern Nevada, eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind at the end of the Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix commented in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had maintained their state of tropical storm or depression within a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950."
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The last models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of torrential rains, which can reach up to 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollón Escarpment in Arizona.
It is likely that between 2 and 5 inches of rain will fall, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated areas, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In the places that do not run the risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rains are considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that part of these torrential rains is beneficial due to the drought conditions that are currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 % of Arizona is suffering from extreme drought, the second most severe category, as reported by weather.com.
In the first place, the hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which is expected to be a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 mph by Sunday morning, is 619 miles south-southeast of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving northward at 19 mph.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected that the storm will hit Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
There is a risk of torrential rains in some parts of Mexico, which could lead to flooding.
“Heavy rains of between 7 and 15 inches are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 25 inches,” as reported by weather.com.
After that, Rosa will head north towards Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the border of Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression. Later, it will move south towards Utah by the end of the night on Tuesday.
“The main danger of Rosa or its remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert.”, says the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attacks in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the area of Radstock, in Avon, according to the Avon and Somerset Police.
The agents have made an appeal to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the despicable and disgusting tactics of the Democrat Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
In addition, Ford testified in the session about this accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, the American people saw the shrewdness, the quality, and the bravery of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with an admirable record of service to the public,” he said to his supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to the candidacy of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.”
I won't be running, but I am a candidate.
“That’s why I go from one place to another, fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump alleged that the Democrats are embarked on a mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
It is expected that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday, according to a high-ranking official of the Republican Party to CNN.
Hundreds of dead in a quake and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the enormous waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and a tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters arrived at the coast at night, dragging many to their death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When it was announced yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not leave immediately, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, for its Indonesian acronym) of Indonesia, in a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it carried cars, trees, houses, it destroyed everything that was on the land,” said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape from the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken bridges and collapsed mosques, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Shots were still being fired at the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2,4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT, for its Indonesian acronym) informed in a press release that the energy released by the great earthquake of Friday was 200 times greater than the energy released by the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
He added that the geography of the city, which is situated at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damages as "significant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, they found bodies of some victims trapped under the debris of the destroyed buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho pointed out that the number of victims and the damage could be greater along the 300 km of coast to the north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were totally paralyzed and there was no information from Donggala, said Nugroho.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there”, said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the authorities claim that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man can be heard warning people in the last floor of a building that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great blackout that cut off communications in the surrounding areas of Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes from Yogyakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic products.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for tasks of rescue and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centers of Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although the staff of World Vision in Donggala have arrived safely in Palu, where the employees are sheltering under tarpaulins installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating scene on their way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as the aid groups put their gears in motion, some people were lamenting that it was not being allowed the movement of experienced aid workers to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulation, only foreign aid, supplies and deployment of foreign personnel can be used if the affected area is declared as a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government says that it considers it a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
After the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing still had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolate stories that write the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small child was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, a parapente instructor for the national team of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which concluded before this month in Indonesia.
Some of the people who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“Based on my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr. Gendon remembered how, in the hours that followed the announcement that the hotel Roa Roa had collapsed in the community of parapente, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival that was taking place on the beach.
However, his messages only showed a grey checkmark, not two blue checkmarks.
“I think that means that the messages didn’t get delivered,” he said.
Thieves made off with $26,750 during a cash withdrawal at a Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, some thieves robbed an employee of Brink who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a cash machine located in the center of entertainment and was preparing to recharge it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running up behind the employee of Brink" and stole a bag of the money destined for reloading.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspicious people leaving the place, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will start to call himself Ye.
Kanye West announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West."
It has been a long time since West, aged 41, was called Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will present his new album, Yandhi.
Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance due to "emotional reasons", as commented by the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious importance for him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’”, commented West in the beginning of this year while talking about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it means us.
He went from being Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred to be called Love and Brother Love.
An old collaborator of West's, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital or small letters, with or without a hyphen.
The Mexican president AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that he is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people at a time when the student movements of the left were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving them monthly subsidies for those who study and opening more free public universities.
He claimed that the lack of job opportunities and educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U. S. should double its funding for I. A.
Now that China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, according to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional of I. A. who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments arise after the announcements of several parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I. A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan a year ago: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I. A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the U.S.”, says Lee.
The doubling of funding means twice as many opportunities for the next great achievement in I. A. to happen in the U. S., as Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most important I. A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of I. A. that defeated the best American player of Othello. Later, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized the previous technological competitions of the U.S. government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would take place, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers have to work hard to get funding from the government, as Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away the leaders of academia; it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
In the last few years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired prominent researchers from universities to work on I. A.
Lee commented that some changes in U.S. immigration policy could also help intensify U.S. initiatives in I. A.
“I think that doctors in I. A. should have permanent residency cards automatically,” he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions as well as the National Natural Science Foundation of the United States and other government agencies fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the Department of Defense of the United States established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic sectors. On the other hand, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As for the National Foundation for Science, it currently invests more than 100 million USD per year in I. A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. federal legislation aimed at creating a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum if they are going to change the name of their country.
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday on whether their name will change to “Republic of Macedonia of the North”, a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its accession to the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the new name proposed, but the nationalists argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the participation will reach the 50 % minimum required for the referendum to be considered valid.
In the referendum ballot, the following question was asked: "Are you in favour of the accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to help Macedonia, one of the countries that emerge from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the aegis of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all”, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopie.
Although it will not be legally binding, many members of the Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote so that it will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons.
The State Electoral Commission declared that, at one o'clock in the afternoon, no irregularities had been reported.
However, voter turnout was only 16 %, compared with 34 % in the last general election in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in Skopie.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko deposited their vote in the referendum of Macedonia on a change of name of the country that would open the way to NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament, in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from in front of the tents set up by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.”
If they don't want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
The Prime Minister Zaev says that the accession to NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, whose unemployment rate is over 20 %.
“I believe that the great majority will be in favor, since more than 80 % of the citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said that a positive result would be a “confirmation of our future”.
In a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Public Policies, it was assured that between 30 and 43 % of the voters were going to participate in the referendum, which means a lower participation than the required one.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, in Macedonia, revealed that 57 % of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 % said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, the participation rate must be at least 50 % plus one vote.
In case of failure, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from the Manchester City, evades the whole defence of the Brighton to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart the defence of the Brighton in the 2-0 victory that the Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian winger received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three defenders of the Brighton before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded a defender before beating several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit it with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan with a shot that went to the right side of the goal.
“Agüero has some problems with his foot”, said Pep Guardiola, City’s coach, to the press.
“We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.”
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League contest.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton's territory.
He made a nice pass to the left wing for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave Sterling a few touches before directing him to the second post.
The forward of the Sky blues launched the ball to the goal just before going out of the limits.
The City faces the Hoffenheim in a group stage match of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil the party for the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff contention, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer expects to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, still have chances in the playoffs.
The Rockies clinched at least a wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the fans of Denver will be excited and that the other team probably played at the highest level that I have faced this year.
Why wouldn't he want to participate?
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it looks like they're leaning toward letting Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would be making his opening number 34, had a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The record of Washington's pitcher is of 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 enters.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we have done is at stake.”
There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I don't present myself, but I am a race, so I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of democrats, they're doing it right now."
And they are determined to regain their power by any means necessary, you can see the meanness, the wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control. And we're not going to give it to them.”
The democrats, he said, are embarked on a mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
“We’ve seen it these last four days,” he said, saying that the Democrats “were furious, were bad, were horrible, and were false.”
He made reference to the Judicial Committee of the Senate nominating the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Are you filtering the document?
Mmm, Mmm, What?
No, no mmm, I'm waiting for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party now encompasses a wide range of opinions.
He's intolerant of people who say what they think.
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted to censure me, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour Members of Parliament who are told that we are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in the House of Commons, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment to be categorically against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not being in agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
He was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, for Europe. It is ironic that Jeremy was in disagreement with leaders on issues on which he was in disagreement with previous leaders.
As it was shown in the notice of the meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham East on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
During the greater part of the eight years that I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been like.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more friendly and compassionate" policy has already been forgotten, if it was ever really applied in any way.
It is becoming more and more clear that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged in terms of whether the leaders of the party consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a similar political vision started to expect him to change his views radically and to adopt positions with which he had never been in agreement, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me tend to be political.
I'm amazed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have such a wide range of opinions and, with each motion for censure or change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice that recommended me to keep my head down and not to make myself heard too much, so that I would be “all right”.
But I haven't gotten involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student in secondary school, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which left my school in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them the most, either as a councillor or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my political ideas, not even in the last elections.
It is impossible that someone in Nottingham East did not know my political positions and the areas in which I was not in agreement with the current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday is that I don't understand this desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunistic politics will prevent me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr remain undefeated at the top of the table
Two late tries at the end of the match may have decided the final result, but, without a doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining match of the Tennent’s Premiership.
Now they lead the table and are the only unbeaten team of the ten teams that participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defense, as well as their ability to make the most of the opportunities, which gave the local team the victory, so the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“We’ve been put to the test in all the games and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,”
Robyn Christie, from the Melrose, commented: "The Ayr deserve the recognition, they took the opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card for captain Rory Hughes, on loan from the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Climo extended the lead of the Ayr with a penalty. Before that, in the middle of the first half, he scored and converted a solo try, which left the score at 17-5 in favor of the Ayr in the break.
However, the Melrose started well in the second part and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
There was a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, and, when the game resumed, Ayr took the lead with a try by Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
The yellow card given to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the fact that they had an extra man for Bruce Colvine's conversion attempt, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for placating Climo without the ball, from the line of scrimmage, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
The weather converted it, as it had been doing almost since the game restarted, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong's punt and sent Gregor Henry into the corner to make it 5-0.
The main character of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the sector of the restoration.
Ford Kieran, the main character of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restaurant business after revealing that he has been named the director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years is Jack Jarvis in the famous program of the BBC, who writes and co-protagonizes with his partner of many years, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make any comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “booming market of Glasgow’s restoration”.
“The sea is ours”: a Bolivia without a coastline has the hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors watch a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, the blue flag waves.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right."
It is a duty to recover it.”
In all of Bolivia, a land without a sea, they still remember vividly the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, as well as the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1st, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision of the International Court of Justice in large screens spread throughout the country, with the hope that the International Court of Justice will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is locked in a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has a lot to say about the resolution passed on Monday.
“We’re very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the tribunal will rule in Bolivia's favor, and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to adjudicate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the resolution of the International Court of Justice came only six months after the final pleadings indicates that the case “was not complicated”, said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have hampered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration”, said Zárate.
In addition, he suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales has undermined any residual good will in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain conversations after this.
The two countries don't exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision would be unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will offer Chile “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “putting an end to 139 years of disputes with mutual benefits”, he said.
In addition, Calzadilla denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political tool.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see what we have to leave behind.”
North Korea says it won't give up its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, says that his nation will never be the first to give up its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, which has been stalled for more than three months after this summit with Kim Jong U, the leader of North Korea.
Ri says that the continuation of the sanctions and the opposition of the U.S. to a declaration that ends the Korean War to subjugate the north is a “fantasy”.
Washington is wary of accepting North Korea's declaration without Pyongyang making a significant disarmament move first.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is a widespread scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's renunciation of its nuclear arsenal, which the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The fashion parades of Paris reveal the last line of enormous hats that are about to land in a shop near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that enveloped the heads of the models.
Other large complements were pineapples with jewels, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
A creation remembered a complete scuba diving team, snorkel and goggles included, while another seemed like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like the fashion of large sizes, you are lucky.
The hunters of style predict that the enormous hats could start to be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats are coming strong from “La Bomba”, with a wide-brimmed hat with a wing of more than 60 centimetres used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The mark of the cult hat that flooded the social networks presented another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the one the model was wearing.
The orange raffia bag, decorated with tassels of raffia and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the La Riviera collection by Jacquemus for the spring-summer 2019 season at the Paris Fashion Week.
As fashion stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: “I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets this summer. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories.”
John Edward: the linguistic competences are fundamental for the citizens of the world.
The independent schools in Scotland have a history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, which is reinforced by the individual and collective successes achieved in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these centers, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for its acronym in English), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
The independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy in the world.
As a sector of education that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it can be observed that modern languages are still a popular and desired subject in schools.
As Nelson Mandela once said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart."
If you talk to him in his language, you reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries, you can't rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can observe that the languages are at the top of the classification tables, with the approval rates being the highest in the independent schools.
In total, 68 % of the students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that form part of the SCIS, showed that 72 % of the students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72 % of those who studied German, 69 % of those who studied French, and 63 % of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that the independent schools of Scotland support foreign languages because they see them as a fundamental competitive advantage that children and young people will certainly need in the future without a doubt.
Today, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as the subjects CTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent schools and in all places.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, of the reasons given by employers about the difficulties they faced in filling vacancies, 17 % were attributed to a lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, the linguistic competences are becoming more and more indispensable to prepare the young people for their future careers.
The possible employment opportunities that require foreign languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last their whole life.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to get ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 % of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, the 15 %, was French.
For this reason, investing in the teaching of foreign languages is important for children today.
If you know several languages, especially those of the developing economies, the children will be better equipped to find a better job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the classical modern languages, while others will focus on the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools they can choose between several languages taught by specialist teachers in this field.
The independent schools in Scotland devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to be successful, whatever the future may hold.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have an important role to play in the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be considered “languages for international communication”.
The independent schools in Scotland will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
It's got to be done.

LeBron James debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for the fans who are waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, has announced that James will play in the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
However, it is yet to be determined how many minutes the game will last.
“It will be more than one and less than 48”, said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that it was likely that James would play a limited number of minutes.
After a session of training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason schedule of the Lakers.
“In this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare myself,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five rallies planned by Trump for the next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court in the meantime, Trump hopes to obtain support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see it online through a live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on the hearings of this week's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, which have been tense due to sexual misconduct allegations and have left in limbo a likely confirmation vote by the Senate during, at most, a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans who are facing the elections in November to gain momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign signaled that the five rallies scheduled for the next week are intended to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
“The control of the Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the campaign,” said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named.
Scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight, this meeting could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as having coverage in the media of Pittsburgh.
The Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the U.S. team shows that it is willing to fight to keep alive the hope of facing the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing of impulse is a completely invented concept, but the players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
Then, where would you say the impetus is now?
“We had a six-point lead and now we have a four-point lead,” said Jordan Spieth after the round.
Of course, Europe has the advantage: four points ahead with twelve more to play for.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel they have the wind at their backs and plenty of reasons to be optimistic, among other reasons because of the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got four points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee to the green and preaches by example.
The guttural cries of celebration rose in volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth match when he and Thomas were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the match in the 15th was received with a similar cry, of those that transmit that it believes that the American team is not yet out.
“What we need to do is to redouble our efforts and concentrate on the game,” said Spieth.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe have won four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple that did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening, and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
This run of form and the way his energy flows with the boisterous crowd makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, in different holes at the same time.
Even so, it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball match in the morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there won't be any help to get out of the holes on Sunday.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch up close because you can see the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Until now, Europe has played better as a team and has a big advantage going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the U.S. team is willing to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe leads with a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over Tiger Woods, who found himself in trouble, falling four points behind in the Le Golf National classification.
The European Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a U.S. team that committed many errors during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but was unable to close the gap.
The American Jim Furyk needs to obtain eight points out of the 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the nickname “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership served to defeat a despondent Woods and a rookie American Bryson DeChambeau by a score of 5-4.
Woods, who did not stand out much in the two matches of the weekend, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the fourballs in the morning, returned to be Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and number three players in the world respectively, with a result of 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and tranquil in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have it all its own way.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4-3 in the foursomes after having lost the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has recovered from a four-point deficit in the individual matches only twice, although Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that "there is no possibility" that it will disarm unilaterally if it does not have confidence.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared before the General Assembly of the international organization that North Korea had adopted “important measures of goodwill” during the past year, such as ceasing nuclear tests and missile launches, dismantling nuclear test sites, and committing itself to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we did not receive a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility that we will disarm unilaterally.”
Although Ri repeated the well-known complaints of North Korea about the resistance of Washington to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, since he did not reject a unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, 2018, when Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must renounce its nuclear weapons before the end of the war.
Likewise, Washington has resisted calls to soften the international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a declaration of termination of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.”
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our mistrust.
Kim did not mention any plans for a second summit with Trump, announced with great fanfare by the U.S. president at the U.N. General Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead of that, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea had been the interested party in the denuclearization of the peninsula instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from the tone of last year’s speech, when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct the missiles of North Korea towards US soil after the “malignant president” Trump, on a suicidal mission, called Kim Jong-un “rocket man”.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said that there was still much to do and that sanctions would have to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the Security Council of the UN should reward North Korea for its advances.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions imposed by the Security Council must continue energetically and without non-compliance until we realize a fully verifiable and complete denuclearization.”
The United Nations Security Council has imposed sanctions unanimously on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had been progress, but a few hours later, North Korea announced that its “demands were those of a gangster”.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea agreed to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. took “corresponding measures.”
He said that Kim had told him that the measures he was looking for were the guarantees of security that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep.
Thanks to a new course that is being taught this year at Harvard University, all university students are sleeping more in an attempt to fight against the growing culture of studying all night drinking coffee.
A professor discovered that the students of the number one university in the world don't have a clue about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how lack of sleep affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked me why she was just finding out about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever spoken to him about the importance of the dream, which surprised me.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students slept very little during the week.
A one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, there is an image of a bedroom, where the students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to bed.
In another section, the participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
After that, an icon of the campus with interactive icons animates the participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that it won’t change the students’ behavior immediately.”
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added the professor Czeisler.
He asserted that the culture of pride in "staying up all night" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good quality of sleep should be “the secret weapon” of students to fight stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since lack of sleep makes the brain generate a feeling of hunger, that's why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after having attended one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
Wait for the next step to be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students think about putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LEDs, which can alter the circadian rhythms, so that they would have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal buries Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when the attack of Dolly Menga desarticulated the disarticulated team of Steven Gerrard to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Rangers wanted their first win away from home since the 4-1 victory over St. Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt defeated the team of Steven Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack took place a few minutes before half-time and Rangers' lacklustre line-up was not up to the task at any time.
Now, the Rangers are in sixth place, the Livingston is in third place, behind the Hibernian by the difference of goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as judge of the line Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance after allegedly being hit in the head by an object thrown from the visitor's side.
Gerrard changed eight of the eleven players who won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt took 11 players from Livingston, who drew 1-1 with Hearts last week, and would have been pleased with the way his well-organised team stifled their opponents throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored at the beginning of the game, when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman who passed through the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent it out.
Keaghan Jacobs committed a foul in the penalty area for the captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send it out for a corner kick.
The Rangers recovered control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson turned a deaf ear to the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox keeper, Liam Kelly, barely had to break a sweat to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's boring shot.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston was against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a deep pass from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher headed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed the ball to Menga to score.
In the rest, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an immediate impact, as the volante passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block it.
Even so, Livingston continued to lead the visitors exactly to the type of game that he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing the way with long passes.
Holt could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stayed firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed home a corner that didn't go in.
The substitute for Rangers, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but, once again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the section Almanac of the “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and COUNTING... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The physicist Geiger, who since then has been a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the movie "The Bells of Coronado", from 1950, with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of scientists cowboys:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium."
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity emitted by the minerals.
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
However, the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a common protein in many cancers and re-inject it.
An essay on the vaccine is generating promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancerous cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein called HER2, and, subsequently, reinjecting the cells.
The professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer”, such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained the professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancerous cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West embarked on a diatribe in favor of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't come out well.
Kanye West was booed off the set of Saturday Night Live after an erratic performance in which he praised the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times I talk to someone white and they ask me how I can like Trump if he’s racist.”
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
Saturday Night Live started the program with a sketch in which Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in relation to the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock posted the recording of the West's tirade on social media.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the audience that he had had a bad time on stage because he was wearing that hat.
“They got me.”
They told me not to leave the house with my hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I’m asleep,” declared, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see me asleep?” and added that he was “going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant that no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to advance?”
Prove with love.”
His comments received boos from the audience at least twice, and the members of SNL seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: “The studio was completely silent.”
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many when he came out on stage wearing a bottle of Perrier as a dress.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING AGAINST THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.”
He is free.
We also”, he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he was "the person previously known as Kanye West".
It's not the first artist to change his name, following the steps of Puff Daddy, also known as P Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the disappeared legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
It is expected that the accused will appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The fiscal will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Nieve in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31 years old, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those roles on screen often transmitted to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit Harington, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he thinks it's "fairly important" to address this issue.
“Personally, I think it’s quite important in this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?”, commented.
“What have we been teaching men while they were growing up, thinking about the problems they see now?”
Kit believes that television can have a part of the responsibility for the increasing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on television, and in the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of the young.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is “tired of battlefields and horses.”
From November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
A few days ago, the actor revealed that he thinks knowing his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, it has given me to my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose was cast as Ygritte, the romantic interest of Kit Harington's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The couple got married in June 2018 at a farm belonging to the family of Leslie, in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced an increase of 14 % in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, there are more than 820,000 people affected, according to the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were notified.
The majority of these were infected by sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread quickly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced to a great extent, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference held in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV by sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGTB community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB community still suffers from a lot of discrimination.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases are due to not using an adequate protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to anti-retroviral drugs as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data to Republican senators and says the allegations are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Representative Maxine Waters criticized on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles said that those accusations were being pushed by right-wing commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more vile lies”, said Waters in a tweet.
Apparently, the information published included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol published the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the posts was associated with Waters's office, and made public the data of a member of Waters's staff, according to the Capitol.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie”, continued Waters.
The member of my personal staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This allegation without foundation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
The declaration of Waters provoked immediate criticism on the Internet, including from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
“Dispute this information with anger”, wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that the temperance necessary to be a Member of Congress.”
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
One should not rebel.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He must maintain his calm and serenity.
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticisms of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of seeming too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who hopes to unseat Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very serious,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted “the relevant authorities and the entities charged with the enforcement of the law” to these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the authors are discovered,” he continued, “and that they are considered legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all members of my staff.”
Critique of Johnny English: Back in Action. Rowan Atkinson's parody of the spy falls short
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new movie with a British focus. It seems that this is what we should do with this new installment of the parodic action and comedy Johnny English franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this ironic self-satire about how clearly ridiculous we are the new opportunity for export of the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and his expressionless face, has renewed his license for the second time. Just his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation aimed at non-English speaking territories.
Of course, it's the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions of squandering glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that type that touched a single note in the theme of Carros de fuego that touched in the ceremony of the inauguration of the Olympic Games of London 2012.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious man traveler and international represented years ago by Atkinson in the forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last episode, there are one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed as a medieval knight while the helicopter's rotors hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humor is a bit short, and it's oddly superfluous, especially now that franchises like James Bond and Mission: Impossible add comic elements without problems.
It seems to be more directed to children than to adults, and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not so ingenious and accurate as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of current affairs is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the supersecret network of spies of Great Britain, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent in service, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the straw that breaks the camel's back for the first minister, a pompous and cornered character who is seeing how her popularity is sinking: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to resort to one who is retired.
That must be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, although he gives extra-curricular lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since it's a spy academy similar to the one in School of Rock.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets with his old friend Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submariner captain, a role that he doesn't take advantage of enough with Vicki Pepperdine.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, with the beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a charismatic billionaire from the world of technology who claims to be able to solve the problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a fancy French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Undoubtedly, they put a lot of effort into this last sequence, but, however funny and noisy it may be, the whole sequence still transmits a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
Just like with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is working on a plan to have Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants the owners of the companies to dedicate the savings obtained thanks to the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea “would fit in” with the party’s economic agenda and would favor the workers.
This change to a four-day work week has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a Labour Party high-ranking official commented to The Sunday Times: It is expected that a revision of the directive will be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day work week is definitely a question that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support these ideas, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day working week in their campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, for the moment, not all members of the Labour Party support this decision.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day week is not part of the Labour Party's policy and will not be discussed at this time."
The shadow chancellor of the exchequer, John McDonnell, used the conference of the Labour Party that took place last week to expound his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "beneficial owners" of companies that provide public services.
Among the plans of the shadow minister also includes the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover all their participation, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond with the irregularities perceived.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and to create inclusive investment funds in which 10 % of the shares of private sector companies would have to be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to £500 for them.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak on "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh and if it could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed at least a week the final vote on his confirmation as a judge of the Supreme Court and, in addition, raises the question of whether the results of the investigation could influence any Republican senator who decides finally to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” said Kennedy.
I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with the judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this had happened, after the allegation had come out and I asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He showed himself firm, resolute, determined.
Graham's vote, however, seems inamovible.
“I’ve already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and I’d ignore the accusation.”
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it tajantely,” said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she names has been able to confirm it.
It has been 36 years.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it been able to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together a star-studded lineup in support of an equally star-studded mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see hundreds of thousands of people moving to Central Park to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real objective of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of awareness that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
If you would like to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), attendees at the concerts have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or any other thing that serves to raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved after 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of "clicktivism", which refers to the position we adopt when we think we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favor of a large number of different objectives.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have achieved commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2,250 million people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from their actions, of which, at least 10 000 million $ have been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", an association of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom with a common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, they have proposed to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, the donors, the national governments and the collaborators of Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition.
The group also affirmed that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from interventions related to nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and difficult road and, in many cases, we will stumble and fall."
But, as they have done previously in the movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing at the New York event this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of Russian energy exports - Department of the Interior
In case of necessity, Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States, Ryan Zinke, according to what is published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates on behalf of the legitimate government, is no more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the main supplier of energy to Europe.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to guarantee that the maritime routes remain open and, in the event, could even block them to guarantee that energy does not end up in the market.
Zinke spoke to the people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the consumer energy industry" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The alternative economic model in Iran and Russia consists, basically, of exploiting and replacing fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to relieve Europe of its dependence on Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To achieve this, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the gas pipeline to $22 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin defends that the fervent opposition of Washington to the project responds only to economic motives and is a further example of unfair competition.
I believe that all of us share the idea that energy cannot be turned into a tool of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers.
The U.S. position has found itself, however, with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization that leads the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the U.S. not to intervene in the energy policy of the EU or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a meeting that took place recently between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully analyze the possibility of running for president in 2020, says the senator from Massachusetts.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would study the possibility of joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a visit to the Holyoke, Massachusetts, City Hall, Warren confirmed that he was considering this challenge.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and to finally have women among the leaders,” she said, according to The Hill.
After the 6th of November, I will seriously consider the possibility of presenting myself as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren gave her opinion on President Donald Trump during a press conference at the City Hall and said that "he was taking the country down the wrong path".
“I’m really worried about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke openly about Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from last Friday, Warren asserted that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that she should run for president in 2020.
A 58% of the "possible" voters of Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% of those polled supported him, however.
In the survey, the former governor, Deval Patrick, was supported by 38 % of the respondents and opposed by 48 %.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for the 2020 presidential election of the former vice president Joe Biden and the senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation that my son is going through, all the things that have happened to him since he came back, they know very well the other families that suffer the effects of the TEPT and other wounds with which our soldiers come back,” said to the public that gathered in a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented on her son and other veterans of war that "they come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday, Bennett was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a domestic violence complaint and possession of firearms under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to obtain a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit against the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker who is facing the current directive, according to NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" presented in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) in opposition to the federal policy has not been revealed.
He said that his friend "and his sons, who are members of a violent gang", abused her, but U.S. immigration officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers who represent these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum requests to the U.S., as countries that face generalized problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States revoked a decision of 2014 that took the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA, for its acronym in English) by which undocumented immigrants who flee domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made some statements on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum requests must be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the individual case and, in contrast, this exception infringes that principle.
In addition, the lawyers pointed out in the letter that the policy that denies entry to immigrants hurts the economy of the U.S. by asserting that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and "represent a necessary workforce."
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
They can apply for asylum if they leave their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion.
The asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people all over the world face every day.
Desperate attempts at rescue in Palu while the number of dead increases in a race to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more dire.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her baby with a fever at a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances are arriving with more bodies.
And the clean water is scarce.
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search through the few belongings that are left to them in an effort to recover what they can.
There are hundreds of injured people and the hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overburdened.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and a broken shoulder, rested in the external area of the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous aftershocks, also very strong.
I couldn't help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake that he lived through while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the ruins of the fallen wall, I think", Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife ask for help, and then a terrible silence.
I don't know what's happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well.
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper touting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. newspapers to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, made reference to the supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to meddle in the elections for the House of Representatives of the United States on November 6, something that China denies categorically.
The accusation that Trump launched against Beijing over its alleged attempt to influence the US elections marked a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish announcements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase the tariffs on imports from both sides.
The compensatory tariffs imposed by China at the beginning of the trade war were designed to fall on the exporters of states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
According to Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is intensifying even more that pressure with advertisements in our free press."
In order to spread its propaganda, the government of China makes use of the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by trying to publish an advertisement in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, in the newsstand on the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China can have on the worrying trajectory that their economy is taking, since the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Communist Party of China.
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts point out that the Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm elections with the debacle of Kavanaugh
As many well-known Republicans are closing ranks in support of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that it could produce a backlash, especially among women, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense, and many republicans have expressed their desire to continue with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher doubted that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself in favor of the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm the disgruntled voters on this issue.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they’re not going to forget tomorrow, or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered outside the Senate were chanting "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) at the moment when the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, said, "The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is way out of the ballpark."
People say that the impact is already very relevant and, in fact, it is.
But it could be even greater, especially among the indecisive voters in the suburbs and the younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who don't usually vote even though they don't like the president".
Even before the public testimony of Ford in which she detailed all the allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts indicated that there could be a backslide if the Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said last week, as reported by NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or even if they sit on the bench with Kavanaugh; it’s also about the way the Republicans have handled all of this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who are on the side of this last one.
In a new YouGov poll, it is indicated that 41 % of the respondents believe Ford's testimony definitively or probably, while 35 % believe Kavanaugh's testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38 % said that they thought that Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30 % said the same about Ford.
After the push of Flake, the FBI is investigating right now the statements of Ford, as well as, at least, the ones of another denunciant, Deborah Ramirez, informed The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was 17 years old while drunk.
On the other hand, Ramirez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitals to him at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is putting together a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the legend of technology. A company that is based on the open source code platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention that lies behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
“It has to be now”, he said about the startup.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses the technology of Solid to allow users to create their own "personal data storage online" or a POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, the calendar, the music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is exclusive to the online storage of personal data is that the user is the one who decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity training through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's director general, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and the necessary skills so that Solid can reach the whole world.
For the moment, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some of the developers included in the staff that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking with "Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce or not a radical change where all their business models are completely modified from one day to the other."
“We’re not going to ask permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate about the neutrality of the Internet.
Even though Berners-Lee is launching Inrupt, he will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee said he was "incredibly optimistic" about the next era of the web.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a French sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honor in Britain.
On Saturday, his two grandsons discovered a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made his grandfather deserve the decoration.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons."
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", he advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions taken by his grandfather were "so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the true heroism of a genuine hero becomes apparent when he is shown such support".
The MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig.
Imagine that he stays up all night to watch the Bellator 206 so that at the end they don't let him see the main event.
The San José card had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live on Channel 5 at night.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were left stunned when the program suddenly changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were not surprised after having to stay awake until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a joke in bad taste".
There is a government regulation that regulates the content that is broadcast from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to the children's programming.
"Peppa the pig", yes."
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they are going to modify the program to include the British audience in the next editions.
“When I think about the option of the retransmission, I think it can work”, said Coker.
“But it’s 6 in the morning on Sunday, so we couldn’t do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.”
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, there were a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly, in fact.
We tried to fix it, because in the beginning we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise that the next time it won't happen.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, which are the ones we usually do. We tried to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we passed.
It's a very unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexual orientation.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a champion.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to secondary school.
In the first programme of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that her intention in talking about the rights of gays was to transmit "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to downplay the importance of winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for some months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized person, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially accepted that you liked children and girls".
He said: "Until today, the feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to show that he was "something", he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexual orientation.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games held in Australia this year to claim that more countries should decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he told the story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to transmit that "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that for him too it was a surprise to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year the winner of an Oscar, who is 20 years older, although he specified that the difference in age had never been a problem.
“When you live so long from such a young age” (she was at her first Olympics at 14 years old and her father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "global perspective" had changed.
If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have revolved around "I have to win a gold medal."
“But you know what, there are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.”
My gold medal from the Olympics is, without a doubt, Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the first row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him that I wouldn’t be able to be in the first row,” he said.
“He had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
At that moment I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to compete in front of my family in the pool at the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the phase of preparation for the Olympic Games. He still got goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was on the bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup.
American golfer Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad record.
Mickelson, who was playing in the event that takes place every two years to try to get a record for the 12th time, was beaten by the captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he has been so many times for the United States, the five-time major champion had to content himself with cheering on in some moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what ails him.
Never the most direct of drivers, not even at the height of his career, the player of 48 years is not in his best shape for the field Le Golf National, where the long rough punishes continuously with errant shots.
And, if the field isn't already daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match of the Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, had started in such an impressive way, Phil Mickelson's match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, he could not say much more.
Furyk understood perfectly the role he had today, patted me on the back and said he would be ready for tomorrow.
He has a great deal of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
He could be the last of a Ryder Cup career that had never been so clearly defined by his own individual brand.
Phil Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 ties, although Furyk said that his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team.”
I think that the younger players have enjoyed having him as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It adds a lot more than just a game.
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the leadership can disappear very soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, you can easily turn it into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 Ryder Cup at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end only managed to finish level with the other team, winning by a minimum margin of 14½-13½.
“Don’t you ever forget that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did one in Brookline and we lost, we did one in Valderrama and we won, but by very little”, said Bjorn, portrayed, after seeing the generation of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading it with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The history will teach me and the whole world that that team is not finished.
You'll have to give it your all tomorrow.
Get out of here and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until all the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that is the only thing we have to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, not more or less, the best players in the world.
Proud of what his players have done on a very difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to get ahead of myself."
Tomorrow is a different kind of challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are the individual actions and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you really put your golfing skills to the test.
This is the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it's time to leave your partner, go and get the best out of yourself."
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as a pair, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points in four.
Furyk has been on both ends in the last days of those great tournaments and has been part of the team that won in Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players on the last day.
We have 12 superimportantes matches tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all advance in the same direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them think that we were going to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face off against Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole route,” said Bjorn about his individual selections.
The new German battleship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old frigates of the Cold War era, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, according to local media.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that leads the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed now until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Armada in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery hampered the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of air-to-air missiles and anti-missiles, as well as some technologies of invisibility, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signals, very reduced.
Among other important characteristics are longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative warships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the Atlantic) will already be out of date when they start to go into service, as Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate frigate F125 had been out of service since last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship back into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It has been the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Very little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent on a combat mission.
The deficiencies in software were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen: half the crew that had been on the old frigates of the class Bremen.
In addition, it was found that the ship has an excessive weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is twice as heavy as other ships of the same class that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached 3,100 million € (3,600 million $), instead of the initial 2,200 million €.
The problems that are attributed to the new frigates are of special relevance in the light of the recent warnings about the reduction in the power of the German navy.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, admitted that the German navy is "lacking ships capable of deploying".
The officer said that the problem has been getting worse over time, because the old ships were decommissioned, but they have not been replaced with new ones.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of the bats.
This new study, which has been carried out in the Highlands of Scotland, is trying to find out how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is expected that everything that is discovered will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide the next conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano bats, as well as the Daubenton's bat and the brown long-eared bat in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations on the property to record the activities of the bats during the season.
The template and the volunteers of NHS will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
The experts will analyze the sounds recorded in the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the bats and what species make them.
Then a report and a map of the habitat will be produced in order to create a detailed image of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, is hoping that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how each species uses them.
With this information, it will be possible to determine the benefits of the management of the habitat, such as the creation of meadows and how the forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and in the United Kingdom have decreased considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
The wind turbines and the electrical cabling can also pose a risk to them, as well as insecticides and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in achieving their goal.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocalization that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the whole country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the matter, who carry out regular surveys, inspections of nests and, in some cases, rescues.
The organisation has also opened the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in Scotland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says that it is the ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there are still many things unknown about bats, so the work that we do here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop.
It is important to check if there are bats before carrying out maintenance work inside properties, as it is possible to destroy a breeding colony involuntarily, killing up to 400 females and young, which would mean annihilating an entire local population.
Murciélagos are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don't know how they evolve their populations."
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape at the same time that his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the allegations of rape as "fake news", and says that people "want to make a name for themselves" at his expense.
His lawyers have been instructed to file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping a woman from the United States, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of having paid 375 000 $ to hide the incident, as reported by Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video of Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, tarnished the report as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false", says the five times winner of the Ballon d'Or, looking at the camera.
They only want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but it's like that, I can't avoid it.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine", added the player, smiling.
The lawyers of Cristiano Ronaldo are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations that appear in what they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will try to get compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in the last few years."
According to reports, the supposed incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After getting to know each other in a night club, supposedly, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's room and there he, supposedly, raped her anally, according to the documents registered in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga declared that Ronaldo knelt down after the supposed incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good guy" and that he had disappointed him that "one percent" remaining.
In the documents it is stated that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and that they took pictures of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he had "fear of reprisals" and was worried about "being humiliated in public".
The woman, 34 years old, says she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged attack took place, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has changed to Juventus, a great club of Italian football, for a contract of 100 million €.
Brexit: the United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers.
The United Kingdom "would regret for the rest of its life" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
Mr. Clark said, "We need an agreement."
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact that delays at the border in the case of a Brexit without a deal could cause the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Auris and Avensis models for Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My opinion is that, if Britain breaks away from the EU at the end of March, there will be production problems in our factory.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have shown their fears in relation to the exit of the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after the Brexit.
The main concerns of the automobile manufacturers refer to the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on the just-in-time method («just in time»), where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be a disruption at the border, which, according to the sector, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than one day of inventory in its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and, in such a case, production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan of Theresa May, where the future relations with the EU are established, is "precisely calibrated to avoid those controls at the border".
“We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that not only allows us to come out well in this moment but that we have to take advantage of the opportunity,” he said in the program Today of BBC Radio 4.
According to Toyota, among other manufacturers, we have to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a very successful supply chain.
Toyota has not been able to say for how long it would stop production, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, in the end, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the shop steward for Unite at the plant, said his members were becoming increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan which sets out our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week, as the dispute over the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 elections, connections between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation before Trump decides to fire the deputy attorney general or not and, in this way, compromise the independence of Mueller has fed the gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone that he himself carried to try to get rid of the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that it was true.
However, the past Monday was at the White House, between news where it is said that he was about to resign.
In its place, it was announced that a meeting with Trump (who at that moment was in the United Nations in New York) would be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, but this would delay the vote of the full Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering all that's happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide as we go along and I will be informing the press, as I usually do.
Some journalists would refute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the shortage of newspapers was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who act grandiloquently, although he said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they fanfaronade."
After that, she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
The president holds more sessions of questions and answers than any other president before him.
The press briefings will continue, said Sanders, but "if the press has the option of asking directly to the president of the United States, I think it's much better than asking me.
We've tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
The press conferences with him are very rare.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why this was so, where he made a casual and, at times, bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Department of Health of Scotland writes to the workers of the EU NHS Scotland about their fears of Brexit.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the staff of the EU office working in the HHS of Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and its desire for them to continue working with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens who work in non-central government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit, which was expected to take place this autumn.
However, the government of the United Kingdom has also intensified its preparations in relation to a possible scenario in which there would be no agreement.
I know that all of this must be very confusing for you.
And, for that reason, I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each and every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue counting on you."
A Christian Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head wound.
Christion Abercrombie, a player of the Tennessee State Tigers was operated on an emergency basis after suffering a head injury on Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of the Tennesse.
The coach of the Tennessee State, Rod Reed, informed the journalists that the injury occurred just before the break.
“He came to the band and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Both the coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A member of the staff of the Tennessee State said to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury or the extent of the damage" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the United Kingdom.
Foreigners will be charged a higher rate of stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless.
The change will neutralize the success achieved by Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters.
The increase in the land transfer tax will be applied to those people who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year which will be used to help the homeless.
The additional money raised by the increase in the stamp duty on the purchase of properties by foreign buyers in the UK will be used to help the homeless.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to harass those who have higher incomes.
The increase in the land transfer tax will be levied on people and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivize the government's policy to combat begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transfer tax, also includes the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, which could reach up to 3 %.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of the properties built in London are bought by people who don't live in the UK, which causes the prices to rise and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to access an affordable home.
Many of the more affluent areas of the country (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping the prices of the properties very high by buying land without any intention of using it and asked the Sra. May to eliminate the fees that are applied to the affordable homes to solve the "shameful problem of housing" in Great Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, among which are controls on rent and the end of evictions without cause.
He also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation."
And that implies to solve the housing market, which is so devastated.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes with greater ease than the working class in Britain.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult to achieve for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland."
The manager of Sunderland says that his "primary objective" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is excited about the possibility of reviving the club of the north-east, which at the moment occupies the third place in the League One (the third division of leagues in England), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League for the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.”
But I only managed to get a beanie B", said Ross on Sportsound on the BBC Scotland.
But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child and it's something that has always made me want to go back.
This opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I am able to lead a club to success.
Among the predecessors of Ross as the leader of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any fear when he turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
In this moment, the success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
because the structure and the installations of this club correspond, without a doubt, to those of the Premier League", said.
“It’s not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I have achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it should be.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after being an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the technical body of the Hearts.
After that, he helped the Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and helped the St. Mirren avoid relegation and win the championship in the following season.
In fact, Ross claims that he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It must have been a real crossroads,” he recalled when he took over the Alloa.
I've always thought that direction was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, but it was good, I was able to make a living with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I've always wanted to train and now I've managed to do it, it's the time of my adult life in which I've felt better, without a doubt."

According to a survey, the perfect time to have a pint is at 5.30pm on a Saturday.
The heatwave of the summer has pushed up the profits of British pubs that are struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8%, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, from the consultancy firm CGA, who compiled the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have made that in July the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased 2.8 % of their profits, while restaurants have even fallen a little more.
The fall of 1.8 % in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly alcoholic drinks had their best month, compared to the majority of restaurants, where they reduced their profits.
The pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered from the heat, although not to the same extent as the restaurant operators.
It seems that the people only want to go out to drink.
In bars and pubs managed, sales of drinks rose by 6.6 % during the month, while sales of meals fell by 3 %.
Paul Newman, the leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April."
The time and the repercussion of important social or sporting events are still the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants are still fighting, although the fall of 4.8% in sales in comparison with last year is going to be especially painful in view of the continuing pressures on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant operators and we will have to wait and see if the more moderate temperatures that we have had in August will provide the relief that they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, which reflects the slow decline in the number of new brand openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, data is collected and analysed for 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9000 million.
One in five children have secret accounts on social networks that their parents don't know about.
One in five children (some even as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that their parents and teachers don't know about, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted among 20,000 secondary school students, revealed an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages.
The news has sharpened fears that sexually explicit material will be published.
20 % of the students said they had a "main" account that shows their parents
One out of every five children (some even as young as 11 years old) create secret social media accounts to hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news has sharpened fears that the publication of sexual content will be prohibited.
20 % of the students said that they had a "main" account that showed their parents, while at the same time they had other private accounts.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret site by chance saw how a teenage boy encouraged others to "violate" her.
The research, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged between 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the board of directors of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to form part of the executive committee of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and Ian Beattie, the president of Scottish Athletics, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want to see sport benefit from his great international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected in the whole community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from having her in her directorship.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help to develop the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA) that left him temporarily unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I suffered a cerebrovascular accident."
He couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent I would recover.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn how to walk again and now I'm doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the breastpump where they compare mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet.
A breast-pump company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares mothers who breast-feed with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is supposed to be the "world's first silent breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music that shows mothers talking about the freedom they feel with the new breast pump.
Four real women dance in a barn full of hay as a dance floor, along with some cows, with signs like: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues to say: "Feed them, feed them, I'm feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I'm feeding my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has created a great deal of controversy.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions of all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say that it puts the focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
It was a very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to be able to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after giving birth.
The Elvie breast pump fits discretely in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatizing for the mother and the baby."
But, why not use them to announce an extractor of milk for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "That's a crazy announcement."
However, other people defended the announcement, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "destructive".
I think it's a great idea.
If he were still suckling, I'm sure he'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but I'm not going to give it any more thought.
It's a great product”, said a woman.
Another person commented: "It's a funny announcement directed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public restrooms), which makes them feel like cows.
In the announcement, there is no praise or criticism of the dairy sector.
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside their brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who express their milk with a pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the nursing bra, which makes it possible for its users to move, hold their babies, and even go out with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, social and ECD of Mother, tells us: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch."
By showing the parallelism between expressive women and lactating cows, we wanted to call attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, as well as to demonstrate in an entertaining and close way the incredible sensation of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time that the Elvie bomb has appeared in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the catwalk for the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minors discreetly relocated to a camp on the Texas border.
The number of unaccompanied minors detained has experienced a considerable increase, despite the fact that the monthly inflow at the border has remained at the usual levels. In part, this is due to the harsh rhetoric and the policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, the majority of godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take in a child would put their own stay in the country in jeopardy.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested did not have criminal records.
“Around 80% of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.”
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people”, said Albence.
In their eagerness to process minors more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum of one month from the arrest, instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to the workers at the reception centers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, instead of in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration issues.
Those who do not consider themselves eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers at the centers and the reports of the system that have come out in the last few months, the longer they stay in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, the signs of distress in these children will be overlooked.
In addition, the transfer to the camp without having given them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them to suffer a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria asks the "occupation forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the vice-prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally present in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue “will be dealt with accordingly”.
“They must withdraw immediately and without conditions,” he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war against terrorism is practically over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we purify all the Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any foreign illegal presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advisory support to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the topic of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "seeding irrational fears" that made them decide to stay outside the country.
“We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
The diplomats of the United Nations say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault on Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had some "clear deadlines" and has expressed the hope that the military action will focus on the jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), which will be "eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy of the United Nations, is waiting to convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win reelection in 2020, unless of course, as many liberal viewers are sure to expect, a resignation or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would be without a doubt "The most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC have more than doubled to 1.05 million and 1.6 million, respectively.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has surpassed the ratings of the cable news channels with 3.5 million viewers for the main news programs at night.
“It’s a strange attraction that we haven’t been able to understand yet,” Neal Baer, the show’s executive producer, tells us. “Designated Survivor” is a dramatic series about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran writer of comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a trip in a taxi he made in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him that he would vote for Trump.
Why?
“Because it makes me laugh”, was the answer that Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information exceeds the limits when you take into account that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear”, the leather jacket of $15,000 of Paul Manafort (“an excessive pride”, in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of the scabrous descriptions of Stormy Daniels of the anatomy of Trump.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Offering something new every night is part of what makes the show seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars,” when we talk about the rotating cast of “The Apprentice” and the show’s daily twists and turns (such as getting into a fight with the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss out on an episode if you don't want to get left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside his house watching MSNBC and CNN at the same time.
He couldn't tear himself away from the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when in those days we used to do all those crazy shows and people used to tell us that this was the beginning of the end of western civilization,” says Fleiss.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

The foreign money flows into the mid-term elections of the most adjusted House of Representatives.
It is not a surprise that the influx of money is coming to the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the reorganization of a district of the Congress with two candidates who are seeking reelection for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure was recently redesigned, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election in the spring.
Lamb faces off against another candidate for reelection, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps in large part with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding war between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
The name of Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed down.
Diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection on the part of Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with the President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Trump Organization evicted the administration of the Trump Organization.
The State Department decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, the development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As the meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the U.S.
But at the end of September, high-ranking officials of the administration made it clear that their intention was that the conference continue, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for the middle of October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a signal of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new threats or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of the special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there are already many public records.
It is thought that Mueller is also investigating the possibility that Trump's campaign was working in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will have to answer to that chamber, just when he is preparing to run again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional sentences, and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his European equivalents.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the war.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and to have supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflexion, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several of these points of inflexion.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good position since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to serve in the office.
Rosenstein says that the explanation of The Times is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation that the F.B.I. has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?”
In addition to all this, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these exams, we'll find ourselves in a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we won't fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the match against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We managed to get a good point, because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We started the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.”
Perhaps we could have won the war in the end, but, in general, a draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out all guns blazing and we were the better team.
This Thursday we'll have another great night in Europe.
I hope we can get the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the previous game. But, with all the fans supporting us, I'm sure we can advance and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will turn out well.
The team is well, the boys are having a great time and we're having a good training session.
I have the hope that we will be able to advance, leave behind the past season and achieve success.
The fear of losing retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night.
Despite the fact that the participants of the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their family members.
Around half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said that they talked to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they talked to their children about this topic.
“The people want me to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you won't be able to prepare them to take care of you if you don't express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and with your family to talk about where and how to receive care, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Incorporating his financial advisor into the conversion will also help him find a way to pay for those expenses.
His options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help him cover his expenses or to insure himself with his own savings, as long as he has the money.
Negotiate his legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Be responsible for obtaining a power of attorney for health care to designate a person of your choice to supervise your health care and to ensure that health care professionals comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
He can also prepare a notarial power of attorney for his finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father is having a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer the questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always at hand.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake: what kind of doctors do we have to treat?” asks Martin.
“What medicines is he taking?”
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned out.

The victim, a man in his 40s, was found in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police officers described the shooting, which happened around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have made an appeal to possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said. It is expected that the number of deaths will increase.
With the communications blocked, the aid workers have not been able to get any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala Regency is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, which is an administrative region hierarchically inferior to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The mines of nickel also have their importance in the province, but they are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west coast of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of great seismic activity, and is often struck by earthquakes.
Next, we summarize some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A great earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in the north of Sumatra, caused the 26th of December a tsunami that affected 14 countries and took the life of 226.000 people in the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims took place in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
There were hundreds of dead victims on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
In 2009, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
In 2016, a shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the mortal earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of earthquakes of great magnitude that caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
The son of Sarah Palin arrested for charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29 years old and a citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, according to the report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin has been ordered to be held in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held with a non-guaranteed bail of $5,000, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when he was asked to make a statement, according to the channel.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a lesser Class B crime, with a sentence of one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the court of veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic assault, and possessing a firearm while under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had told him that she had punched him in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking the violent behavior of her son to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead victims
At least 384 people died after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communication networks have fallen and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the next few days.
The earthquake took place right next to the center of Sulawesi, which is located in the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on the social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a playa festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived at the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October 2017 attack on a bike path in the West Side of Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and bicyclists as he went.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injuries, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible penalty of death, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury presented Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder in aid of a criminal enterprise, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of destruction of a motor vehicle.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation”, according to the prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been over a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal execution in New York was that of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This couple was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said to the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov said to the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked that the flag of ISIS be hoisted in his hospital room, according to the police.
He has been declared not guilty of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved,” said Patton.
The defense team for Saipov had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory MP says that Nigel Farage should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of UKIP said that politicians had to "feel the heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have left the EU by now if Nigel Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing the Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more when a group of Tories in favour of remaining in the EU have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers plan on its feet in the face of attacks from Brexiteers, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted on continuing to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the “chaos”.
The Leave Means Leave MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we’d have been out by now,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his declaration of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subservient."
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she said to reporters: "Just one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people."
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start to listen.”
In a message directed to May, he added: "First ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said to the concentrated that they would have to feel the heat if the politicians were going to betray the decision taken in the referendum of 2016.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them that they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit, feel the heat.”
“We are going to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory with the Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, the pro-remain demonstrators marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards reading "Tories Against Brexit" after the launch of the group this weekend.
The Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the problems they had with an application for the party during the opening of the conference.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the IT systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a total farce.”
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of presenting himself for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat of Massachusetts spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There has been a lot of speculation about the possibility of Warren running against Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was his 30th meeting with the electors using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he was going to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time has come for women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman in the highest office.
An arrest was made for the murder of the LSU football player Sims
The police of Baton Rouge (Louisiana) announced this Saturday that they have arrested a suspect for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the basketball player of the LSU, the past Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who is seen in the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the campus of the Southern University at first light on Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death”, said the police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon, and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office.
Sims, a 1.98m tall player from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to the world title after his team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton out of the race by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Sebastian Vettel was the first to enter the pits and left Lewis Hamilton to run in the back of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out of the pits a lap later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after an action with the wheels almost touching that made the Ferrari driver have to give up the inside line at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished in the seventh place at the end of the first race.
He led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered the pits in lap 44, but he could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps after recovering Raikkonen's fourth position.
It has been a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman by letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple.
That's a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia Western, the president did not mention directly the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, repulsive and false”.
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false,” he said.
“When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say “But if I didn’t do it.”
I didn't do it.”
Don't you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, "what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it.”
Well, give me a minute.
Have we filtered it? No, we haven't filtered it”, he added while imitating the senator.
A Feinstein received the letter in which the accusations against Kavanaugh were detailed by Ford in July, and it was leaked in the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, as reported by The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and, therefore, I did.”
But his refusal didn't seem to sit well with the president, who during the Saturday night rally said the following: "I'm going to tell you something: that was some really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't do it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.”
Continuing with his defense of the nominee to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
“They are determined to regain their power by any means possible.”
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get power and control”, said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars made amends for their Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday by beating them 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early 2-0 lead thanks to the goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local match before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee United before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
This has been the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee by 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won all three previous games.
The first goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered an initial very animated period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game in the 13:10 mark before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to tie the game in the 15:16 mark.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the final minute of the second half and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as he approached the final whistle.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape in the plane of the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many more are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to batter the area, and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his friends fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu. The tower was being affected by a strong tremor.
He remained firm to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at that moment, could take off safely.
He jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this”, he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand people. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there are still many bodies under the ruins and we have not been able to contact many people,” says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Large waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.”
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted all over the place.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as many survivors as possible, but we don't know what we'll find there."
This already is in itself a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the army of the country: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
Are you ready?”, asked the CNN.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok at the beginning of this year, which killed more than 550 people..
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the aircraft accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that the 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that since Saturday evening it had not been possible to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital..
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon that is before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had overshot the landing strip.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came very low.
“That’s something extremely good”, said Jaynes.
Jaynes commented that he and other travelers were able to advance through the water up to their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said that the passengers panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who were working on a nearby wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the aviation security network indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution ended its presentation of its arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He exposed before the jury the way he used the phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the accused of 29 years, and Jessica Chambers, the victim of 19 years, the night in which this died.
Rowlett said that he received the location data of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements, as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time that he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls, and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life”, said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be decided by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: "What is conscious hip hop?"
A trio of hip hop artists want to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop moved away from its political roots and started to talk about social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Interpreters such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A nanny from New York sues a couple for firing her after a racist text message.
A New York nanny is going to sue a couple for discrimination after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person”.
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit with a case of “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her consternation at discovering that the new childminder, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO OTRA PERSONA NEGRA”, wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that instead he was expecting a Filipino nanny, according to what is said in the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for a day's work and sent it home in Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for a compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving a compensation of $350 per day for the position of six months of internal work for which he had been hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them that things don’t happen like that,” he said to The Post on Friday and added that “I know this is a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racists by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they could not trust her after having offended her.
“My wife had sent him something that he didn’t want to say.”
She is not a racist.
We are not racists,” said Joel Plasco, the husband, to the Post.
“But wouldn’t you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was by mistake?”
To your newborn?
“Let’s go!”
Comparing the demand as an "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to go for someone like that?”
That's not a very decent thing”, said the banker of investments.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and their logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, as revealed in a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who was reading it for the first time before its publication."
It is very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC chamberlain before being inspired by a teddy bear to write a children's book, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "agridulce" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t like to boast,” he said.
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you were proud of him, even though it wasn’t really your achievement.”
I think that he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to his own Paddington.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
As soon as she landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“She called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that she didn’t expect to succeed,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
I received the call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did it.
I told him: "Tashi, I love you very much."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep his heart beating were running out, and his system was beginning to fail.
She had died before her time, and everything was going out.
I was only able to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't howl, scream, or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
In fact, I had to be firm.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was taking place.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I bent my head and the tears were falling all the time.”
It's hard to explain, but it was in the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all of my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning put up cards to prevent suicides is a bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicides are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call if they need help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.”
They always said that her smile could light up any place.
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the brother of Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after having taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm always worried about the consequences."
Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk about it.
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been living for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“He didn’t say that he was depressed or anything like that,” she tells us.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.”
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to get over it: "It leaves a void in the whole family."
He has left us in ruins.
But all of us have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited investigation in time, with a limited scope), maybe we could bring a little bit of unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “going off the rails” in the middle of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican partisans not want the FBI investigation to take place?
His refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
There are only five weeks left until the mid-term elections on November 6. If, as is expected, the Republicans have a bad result, their attempts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh got to know his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary to the President.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 republicans and 49 democrats.
It is not yet clear if Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of deserters from North Korea “fall” with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs that smugglers of people charge, have been the key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of the deserters from the North were eventually offered citizenship in the South.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border into South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers that deserters are illegal immigrants instead of refugees, and they are often repatriated.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in the last months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the foreign minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the lack of progress on the sanctions imposed by the United States.
“Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histrionic" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said that the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "histrionic" and that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin (Texas).
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she’s hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny the accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking as he spoke of his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also condemned explicitly the Democrats, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by some liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, the testimony of Kavanaugh proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed his partiality against the Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he’s pursued the Clintons and the Democrats,” said.
Pelosi put her objections when she was asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed in the case and if the Democrats got the majority in the House.
“I will only say one thing: if he is not telling the truth to the Congress or to the FBI, he will not be fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court where he is now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible rulings of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, which is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time for a hysterical person and an impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine,” said Pelosi.
And the women have to pick it up.
It's a justified diatribe, it's been months and years of fury overflowing, and she can't let it go without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s all that strange, do you?”
She continued talking: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she was angry and began to cry, she told the person with whom she was talking: "Maybe you think I'm crying because I'm sad."
No, I'm not angry.
And after that, he was doing what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Crying is allowed as a way out for anger in part because it is not understood well.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once when I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager with whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
“Don’t let them ever see you cry,” he told me.
“They have no idea that you’re furious.”
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.”
Someone referred to us as "Blancanieves y los siete enanitos".
As the campaign was already very advanced, he stayed behind in the collection of funds, so it was promised that he would not enter the race again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, only gave her $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?”, he asked himself.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on capturing voters instead of delegates, and anger at the sexism), that she choked.
“The logical thing would have been to think that I had had a nervous breakdown,” said Schroeder, remembering the reaction of the press.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.”
I remember thinking, "What are they going to put on my tombstone?"
“Did she cry?”
The trade war between the U.S. and China could benefit Beijing.
The first salvos of the commercial war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still a long way to go for the battle to end, a rupture between the two countries could benefit Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning to China at the beginning of the year by imposing tariffs on the main Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs that affect 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds sterling) in goods, which will raise taxes on half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has taken retaliatory measures, recently applying tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. products.
China has committed to equalizing the attacks of the U.S., and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world is going to back down soon.
It would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping to admit defeat.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a sudden collapse of the economy in either of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than people have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is ready to welcome back refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground is today more stable and safer thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to try to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their means of subsistence.
The United Nations estimates that, since the beginning of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still six million people who live in the country and who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem recognized that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional help or the help of the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup of 2018 by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside of Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup on European soil in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish team captain Thomas Bjorn won the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American golfer Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his ball into the water on the par 3 16th hole, admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Francesco Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 against the player with the lowest ranking in the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European player with the most victories in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.”
It's been a very hard year.
I'm totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have been able to recover the cup.
It's a team achievement and I'm very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now the torch is passed to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the legend of golf in the United States, Tiger Woods, by 2 and 1 in an individual match.
“I feel an incredible pride to have beaten Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching this man,” said the 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his career in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, leaving him only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting."
There was a moment this morning in which we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we ruined it.
I'd like to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I really like these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now it's our turn to bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.”
Update of the red tide: Decrease in concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The new report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (Commission of Fishing and Wildlife of Florida) shows a general reduction in the concentrations of red tide in the area of the Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, flowering irregularities are being reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which suggests a reduction in concentrations.
The flowering of the red tide extends approximately 130 miles along the coast from the county of Pinellas to the county of Lee.
Irregular parcels can be found as far as 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but not as many as last week.
Red tides have also been detected in the county of Pasco.
During the past week, there have been medium-sized gatherings in Pinellas County and on its coast, medium-sized gatherings in Hillsborough County and on its coast, medium-sized gatherings in Manatee County and on its coast, medium-sized gatherings in Sarasota County and on its coast, medium-sized gatherings in Charlotte County, medium-sized gatherings in Lee County and on its coast, and low gatherings in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory irritation in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwestern part of Florida during the past week.
