In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a widely accepted theory, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not, such as their colour and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this bird has a reddish-brown upper plumage and a pale or carotenoid lower plumage.
Moreover, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Given that the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed axis, called the rachis, but do have other feather characteristics (quills and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that the rachis is probably the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but was used to regulate temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers say that, although the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed shows the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

Although it was a highly theoretical work, the programme was written with the purpose of simulating the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way would be responsible for the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the galaxy of Sagittarius in the same way that the moon exerts a gravitational pull on our planet and causes the tides.
The experts came to the conclusion that dark matter interacts with itself in the same way as regular matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy is in the form of a halo and consists of numerous small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in South Africa's Zululand.
During an interview, he pointed out that the new variant generated "much concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate."
Dr Moll believes some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of the infected were staff at the hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they have had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total number of TB patients still seems to be relatively low: 6000 of a total of 333 000 patients infected at a particular time in South Africa.

The authorities have also guaranteed several million doses of the vaccine to fight against encephalitis, which will allow pharmaceutical companies to prepare for next year.
This year, the shortage of financial resources and the lack of prioritisation, compared with other diseases, have led to delays in the implementation of vaccination plans in historically vulnerable regions.

In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed ballot in an envelope marked with the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials have confirmed the voter's identity, the voter enters the ballot into the ballot box and signs the voters' list.
The French electoral law sets out the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, which allows voters and observers to check that there are no extra ballots at the start of voting and that no other ballots are added which are not those of those voting, properly counted and authorised.
The candidates have the right to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, volunteers count the votes under rigorous supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

Carpanedo took part in two individual races apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he received a "Did not finish first race" as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she took 10th place in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four slalom skiers failed to finish their races and a total of 45 slalom giant slalom competitors failed to qualify for the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh were able to recover the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The deputy inspector general, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting trial, any eyewitness statement can be questioned, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects.
The Crown Office, which has responsibility for prosecutions, said it would not be making any further comment at this stage.
According to the information that has been leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the pre-1967 borders.
Other topics that were also discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations regard as sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to five.
During the supplementary pest control trial, gamekeepers had to keep a close eye on the shooters, as this was being monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales Association of Sporting Shooters (NSW) Inc., suitably qualified volunteers were recruited within the Association's shooting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the Office of Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, said that comprehensive training was given to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures aimed at steering the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the widespread protests that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, at times violent, were triggered by the fact that elections are not being held, in some cases since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry said the delay in Apple's report was "truly regrettable".
Mariana was shaken by a quake at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency in the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage on the mainland.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research into premature birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that investigators from the government recovered the flight data recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Powder Runnels said: "Luna was as rare as I am; even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place.
Since 2008, among the 1400 people surveyed in advance of the 2010 federal elections, there has been an 8% increase in those opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II was over.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At one end of the survey, 29 per cent of people believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other end, 31 per cent believe it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist in the 100 metres freestyle and 200 metres freestyle had to swim the 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle and three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been called into question following his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers because they are banned in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using a variety of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets have served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets are formed, particularly our own, given that comets crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He described the rumours as "political gossip and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce flight distances, which would save millions of gallons of fuel a year, as well as carbon emissions.
Uses satellite technology, in contrast with the old ground-based radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate data.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, the possibility was considered that the game would be played behind closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the science magazine Science reported on the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, in the US, and Uppsala University, in Sweden, have revealed that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated to take much longer, because of the reproductive isolation between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched into a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it could be used to decorate illustrations made by hand in books called'manuscript illuminations'.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will change depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product analysed determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Shake the two dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean and damp hands, roll them into a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in your hands and your external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had sanitary workers in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to give us much simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to her today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among so many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, hares and deer.
Finally, there are many small carnivores (including domestic cats) that feed on species of small size that are in much greater abundance, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the big cats that most socialise and their lives are spent in large groups called prides.
Herds are formed by one to three adult males from the same family group, with up to thirty females and their young.
In general, females are very close to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behaviour as wolf packs or dogs, with whom they share a remarkable similarity (unlike the other great cats) in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, dive and pull five times as hard as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but more like a sentence spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. Where possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Most of their prey will be much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) using their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from the main body of which they are a part (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island), they will often find themselves in a different environment to that which they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
Over time, as the growing population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will no longer be possible to classify them as belonging to the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
Plant food is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. They also offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except from other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as another group in the palate, which means that anything that came his way had no escape.
We don't know, but it could have been a viper.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a dinosaur as big as the T. Rex was no match for him.
Although most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some rather unconventional items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even hedgehogs.
Another thing that distinguished them was that the poor and the women ate sitting down, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and reclining while they ate.
It is not possible that the ancient Roman recipes included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests sought to meet the needs of those celebrating festivals and ceremonies.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramidal towers were built, called ziggurats, to form part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just display windows that faced the street.
In the land of Canaan there were no great forests, so wood was very expensive.
Few people lived in Greenland. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
While each country was 'Scandinavian', there were marked differences in relation to the people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Nevertheless, that is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that the huge document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
Although the D-Day landings, as well as the subsequent battles, had succeeded in liberating the north of France, the south still remained.
His government was in the hands of the Vichy French, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed a peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders rather than fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, Operation Dragoon was launched through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In less than two weeks, American and French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilisation derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related both to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city state and which, moreover, determines to some extent the size of the society.
State cities are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilisation entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogenous spread.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and are not recognised as civilisations in their own right.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, this function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
He was not empowered to annul fiscal or customs laws between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval by all the states for their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second team with the most wins in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the north, with athletes taking part in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
There are about 7,000 islands in Japan, the largest of which is Honshu.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an 'archipelago', from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who were sailing in the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the indigenous method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labour to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal and western region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this last as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three major buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 per cent of Machu Picchu had been restored and work continues today.
As an example, the most common photographic image format at the global level is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the film era.
Today it is still being produced, but the most important thing is that the dimensional relationship has been transferred to digital image sensors.
In truth, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
This is why it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest common divisor of integers) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS group of formats) are similar or very similar to this appearance relationship.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant mockery and ridicule, is a simple rule that generates dynamism while at the same time providing a certain order to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected all, from the monarch to the rabble.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth is to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are to be used for that specific purpose.
The central leadership of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognised international rule of law and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters in whole sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany was expecting a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with Edison in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with four cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each period or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, when thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
It is the same with the military, because instead of basing the charges on class, they are now based on rank.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has lasted in time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one is sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains in the vicinity. From the inside of this cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramids in the shape of a pyramid and of great size built to honour the deceased pharaoh.
The Guiza Necropolis, or "Valley of the Dead Necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honour of his wives and relatives.
The 'arrow up' mark resembles a V and the 'arrow down' mark is similar to a nail or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog and pull the bow.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, whereas a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on stringed instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and his sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd who were shouting and making threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the uprising shook his head at the executed guard in front of the Queen, who was in a panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interest on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the Wall Street banks.
Already, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical European period in which these events took place is known as the Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300.
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological imperative to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the fate of humanity and how it relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself unfolds on a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has 'effects' on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of cars necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a reduced volume of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of cars also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography moulded people and, with the passage of time, customs and cultures developed which were related to that geography which, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital today, Constantinople was known as such in feudal Europe.
His fame as the centre of luxury began approximately 400 BC and extended to approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century his status declined, especially due to the fact that, on their return, the Crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of 'fashion capital' was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The pinnacle of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the form of dress was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Agriculture for subsistence is understood to be that which aims to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, which combines the use of indigenous seeds from the region with crop rotation and other comparatively simple methods to maximise production.
Historically, much of the principal activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather individuals with similar ideas and feelings of social marginality and provide them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic styles of dress, mannerisms and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for graphing the importance of socialising is to analyse the few and lamentable cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialised by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a severely disabled child.
It is possible that wild children have suffered traumatic experiences or severe child abuse before they were abandoned or ran away.
It is said that others were brought up by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is reared exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviour (within its physical capabilities) almost identical to that of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented either in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also a type of animated PowerPoint slide.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to understand on their own.
Children are taken into care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care or education; but it happens.
We can see that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our out-of-home care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The purpose of family placement is to meet all the needs that were not met in the previous home.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different aspects of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, apprenticeship and socialization are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few hundredths of a second.
Specifically, it is claimed that, by reading microexpressions correctly, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained the way in which those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, nevertheless, evaluate sincerity with precision.
Even suggests that the ability to interpret human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination barter variation from one generation to the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources at its disposal.
Moreover, not doing so has serious consequences: economic slowdown, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digested by primates like us, except when cooked.
In contrast, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not come as a surprise if our own predecessors solved their 'protein problems' in the same way that chimpanzees do today.
Waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a fairly soft alarm clock that will bring him back to a conscious state without waking him completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a diuretic) before going to bed, which will make you get up to go to the toilet.
A person's level of inner peace is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the life force with which we can cope.
We can all attain enlightenment. The only thing that blocks the way is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread along the path of loving-kindness Mahayana and numerous yoga techniques from India.
Generally speaking, laicism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love, which encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be unblocked, the chakras can be activated and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. When the war ended, the clash of systems, process and culture began to distance the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who had been allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend over the next 40 years and it would be fought in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that on 17 September 1939 the Polish defence was already broken, its only hope was to retreat and reorganise itself in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way of moving large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since time immemorial, the function of the navy has been to ensure that its country retains the ability to move its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did in the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10 000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
In order to get their milk, hair, flesh and skin easily, the ancient peoples and tribes began to take them.
Domestic goats were generally gathered into herds that roamed the hills or other areas of grazing, often tended by herdsmen who were often children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, railway tracks had been laid by the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The introduction of sleepers to keep the rails in place was quite early. However, gradually it was realised that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron at the top.
This became a regular practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels and, in 1767, iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transport was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Our predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedalism have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, be part of environmental movements or even become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, the future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment.
It is manifest that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap copies".
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time and read it in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On the 6th of July a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on the 9th of July.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
At present, almost all computers work on the basis of binary data coding.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to allow an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be finding an open bottle of medicines or toxic cleaning products.
Read the label for information on specific first aid for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term insect parasite in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with fleas, a highly developed parasite of humans.
The assassin and bedbugs are lice; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been reported in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the union of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies showed that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from EM.
A couple might conclude that bringing up a child would not be the best thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was placed on the classical works, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially in the field of science, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, the West distanced itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Frequently, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behaviour depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate self-sustainingly and have a free running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA consisted of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using viruses.
Two experiments were carried out in which they marked the DNA of the fungus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulphur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic fragment and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks, and study of information on the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs, and they often meet others whose jobs are in the place from which they have just come.
In this dynamic launch vehicle, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists are saying that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear such complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
What is the reason that transport systems give rise to such complaints and why are there so many failures every day? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Regrettably, it is not an easy task to study traffic flow, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and to be represented approximately by mathematical models.
In order to graph more clearly the circulation flow, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both planning and design as well as the operation of road vehicles.
The first species to fly were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, pressing them against their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of smaller places to hide from predators.
At present, the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera are the only insects unable to fold their wings.
Millennia ago, a man called Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, correct?
The Amazon River is the most voluminous and the second longest river in the world. It contains eight times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
About 20 per cent of the world's river water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they were never surpassed in size or in the sublime technique of their construction.
The old Egyptian town of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the smallest in population.
Italian is used in the Vatican both for drafting its regulations and for issuing its official statements.
The language that the majority of those who work in the state speak is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All the citizens living in the Vatican adhere to the Roman Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known from antiquity, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It had a greater resemblance to the states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but at the same time it had the theory that they are transformed into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metals.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Therefore, when the pencil was invented, it won many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need a pencil.
The question is what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy cart rolls up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, that is, they tend to disintegrate with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer shell is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines assert that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they have grown to maturity.
These theories analyse what causes people to want certain things and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour when managers begin to lead their former colleagues.
Managers in this category find it hard to make decisions that are unpopular with employees, impose disciplinary measures, carry out performance appraisals, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into an unrecognisable person who believes it necessary to change everything that has gone before and do it their way.
In the end, the ultimate success or failure of the team is down to the leader.
This kind of behaviour often ends up distancing the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are small differences.
Often, virtual team members act as a point of contact for their physical team.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet at different times, for example, times that might not be understood by local management.
The existence of an invisible'real team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organisation to submit itself to the process of establishing a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively in operational departments of an organisation, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this, it is possible that an organisation that works as a team to overcome a place problem in order to introduce a new innovative process in order to meet customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and increase its accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour contributes to the research of scientists.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with plenty of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant speciality within computer science, which deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and respond to customer queries, as well as facial, handwriting and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial Intelligence is now often used in the economy, medicine, engineering and military, in the same way as it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study tours are an important part of any classroom.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital and every year the website is updated, but the previous versions are archived as an online scrapbook.
Blogs can also contribute to improving student writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger begins to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also requires students to be more understanding of the world around them. The need to engage their audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to go beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to internet content, students can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics.
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are more south and the north hosts the natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All these aspects, among others, highlight Ontario as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that causes surprise to many: more African Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wild life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route linking Europe with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in rejecting men and do not fear defending your position (cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of the White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared to tourists.
Goma is a tourist point in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the eastern border, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Nyiragongo's lava destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is quite safe, any visit outside must be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the North Kivu province, where fighting continues.
In turn, the city is the base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To travel within Goma, you can opt for a motorcycle taxi (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and distant image.
Today Tombuctú is a poor city, but it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included on the World Heritage List in Danger, as a result of the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates' African Miracles special on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has a surface area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecozones, each of which has a different wild life.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognised as a SANParks icon.
As in all natural reserves in South Africa, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
It may also be convenient to buy a Wild Card which allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
A comparison has been made between the buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong and a luminous bar chart that shows the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront.
It is in the reclaimed land on the north coast of Hong Kong where the dense urban development is concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site.
Despite this, the forests are not just mangroves, but also contain some of the last remaining trees of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swamp.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a sanctuary for wild life and it is estimated that there are about 400 tigers in the area and about 30 000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is an easy and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cantilever structure that spans it, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two 3.5 m wide lanes.
Under the bridge there is a free space of 15 metres and, although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will end.
The eastern part of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunters as well as practising subsistence agriculture.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá groups, for example, hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spaniards began the stage of colonisation, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
There are also other tournaments and lower league matches to be seen throughout the year.
On the site of the Argentine Association of Polo you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo games.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in terms of the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there.
Sterling is usually accepted everywhere in the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There is a good chance that credit cards will not be accepted in the outer islands, but you could use British or American cash.
It is practically impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so do so before leaving.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30°C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: although it is very rare for temperatures to fall below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically 'rainy' or 'dry' stations; the amount of rainfall is almost constant throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild life is still wild, so do not feed it or get in its way.
According to the authorities at the parks, you should keep at least 100 yards/metres away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/metres from other wild animals.
Even though they may appear docile, the fact is that bison, bighorn sheep, elk, bears and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors suffer injuries every year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
In addition, remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so you should avoid cooking foods that release a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of around 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except a British cruiser. More than two hundred Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the Prime Minister Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches due to the fact that Auckland has two ports. The most famous are in three areas.
In the district of North Harbour, in the Pacific Ocean, are the beaches of North Shore, which stretch from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
The beaches are almost all sand with safe swimming places and most have pohutukawa trees which provide shade.
In the Waitemata Harbour, the beaches of Tamaki Drive unfold, in the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach.
Number One is the most popular local beer and it is not complicated, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a great variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transport.
The local water from the tap is completely safe for drinking, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the notion of 'white coffee' to be foreign.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year and, there, wounds by any of these causes are rare.
In any case, take the advice of the authorities, respect all the signals and pay special attention to security alerts.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people.
The ocean is not the place where actively living salt water crocodiles reside. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booked accommodation gives you the peace of mind that you will have somewhere to stay when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camp sites.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
You can also keep the reservation in case you need time to think about the offer, or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the majority of those attending the music events decide to camp at the site and most of the audience consider that this is a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the action, then you will have to get there early to get a place near the musical events.
It is important to note that, while the musical performances may have finished, in other parts of the festival they may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic in winter, check where the cabin is located, as crossing the ice generates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During the cruises to St. Petersburg, there is also time in the city. Those who disembark are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos normally make great efforts to maximise the time and money that their customers spend. Generally, there are no windows or clocks and exits can be difficult to find.
Special offers of food, drink and entertainment are often offered to keep guests in good spirits and within the hotel.
Some establishments serve free spirits.
Any person who proposes to drive in high latitudes or in mountain passes must foresee the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy or snow-covered roads, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as you do on bare tarmac.
During snowstorms, you can get so much snow that you can get stuck in very little time.
In addition, visibility can be reduced by snow or by condensation or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries the ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely to be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable for many visitors.
The popular use of the term'safari' refers to journeys by land to see the remarkable wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles and the standard equipment will provide good visibility.
Sometimes leopards, lions and jaguars can be shy, so you will have a better chance of seeing them using binoculars.
The walk known as the walking safari (also known as 'bush walk','safari on foot' or 'walk') consists of walking, whether for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. A number of events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, there may be complications.
There are different types of cancellation insurance policies, but since the end of March, the coverage of most of these policies based on the coronavirus is not extended until July 2020, which is when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the majority of entries to events will cost between JPY 2500 and JPY 130 000 and that common passes will cost JPY 7000.
Ironing wet clothes can help to dry them.
If you don't have a flat iron available, or if you don't want to use a flat iron, you can try a blow dryer, if available.
Do not let the fabric get too hot, as it may shrink or burn.
There are different methods for purifying water, some are more effective against certain specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others, it takes several more.
Not all filters have the same effectiveness and, if this concerns you, you should consider buying bottled water with a certified seal.
It is possible that travellers may come into contact with animals which are not known in the regions from which they come.
Plagues are capable of ruining food, causing irritation or, in more serious cases, triggering allergic reactions, spreading poison or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases, in themselves, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals by the use of their force, are not usually included in the category of pests.
Free trade in customs duties offers an opportunity to acquire, in certain places, duty-free and tax-free products.
Visitors to countries with a high tax burden can, sometimes, save a significant amount of money, particularly on goods such as spirits and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is one of the most challenging stretches of road and is often traversed through isolated and lonely terrain.
If you don't usually drive on rural roads, be alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp bends.
The established speed limits are notoriously lower than on the previous sections and those that follow, generally 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and compliance with them is even more important than on any other section.
However, curiously, cell phone signals are much better here than in many other sections of the road like Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry is of good quality and, in Bavaria, the cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those made in Austria, its neighbour to the south.
Common are fruit cakes, with apples cooked throughout the year and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. In general, popular cakes make an excellent combination with a strong cup of coffee.
If you have a craving for small but tasty cakes, try the Berliner, also known as a Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a recipe based on herbs and spices and served with meat or vegetables.
We can find dry curry and wet curry, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the villages of the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry. In southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that are spread throughout the country.
However, employed without any other qualification, the term tends to refer to the original cuisine of the central and eastern regions of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of dishes seasoned with simple condiments, with a predilection for the tastes of the Javanese, such as peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the riders' feet which hang on both sides of the saddle.
While providing greater stability for the rider, they can present problems of safety, as it is possible that the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a jockey is thrown from a horse, but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the animal bolts.
First of all, most of the riders use riding boots with a narrow heel and a flat sole.
In addition, there are saddles, especially English saddles, with safety bars that allow the leathers of the saddle to come away from the structure if a rider who falls off pulls back.
Cochamo Valley is the most popular climbing destination in Chile and is known as the 'Yosemite of South America' for its extensive walls and granite cliffs.
The summits also offer dramatic views from the peaks. Climbers from all corners of the globe are constantly delimiting new routes between their infinite potential.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular winter sports that involve sliding down a slope on skis or a snowboard.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called'ski lovers', who plan their holidays completely around skiing in a specific place.
The idea of skiing is very old, as there are cave paintings that depict skiers and which date back around 5,000 years.
Alpine skiing as a discipline dates from the 17th century. In 1861 the Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacker on skis: also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
Although they are linked, in general they do not involve the practice of cross-country skiing or alpine mountaineering, developed on steep slopes and with skis and boots much more rigid.
Imagine the ski slope as a hiking trail.
In satisfactory conditions, it will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if it were on foot, but very rarely will it reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy rucksack on prepared pistes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.
However, the Schengen space works as a single country in this respect.
Generally, if you move within this region, you will be able to cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
In the same way, with a Schengen visa, you do not need separate permits for each of the member states of this space. This will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the lower age limit might be more restricted in places like North America than in Europe.
It is possible that handmade products may be classified as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar products manufactured in series.
The reindeer husbandry is an important way of life for the Lapps and the reindeer husbandry culture is important for many engaged in other professions.
Even so, even traditionally, not all the Finns have devoted themselves to reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but have lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Today, many Finns work in modern commercial activities. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.
While it is used extensively, especially among those who are not Roma, it is often given a pejorative connotation, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate assessments of Roma.
If your destination country is subject to a travel alert, this could affect your travel insurance or cancellation insurance.

Travel warnings are only a brief summary of the political situation in another country.
The views presented are often superficial, generic and too simplistic compared to the more detailed information available on other sites.
The term severe weather refers, in general, to any severe weather event that is capable of causing damage, social disruption or death.
Severe weather can occur anywhere on the planet and there are different types depending on the geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Hurricanes, gravel, excessive rains and forest fires are types and consequences of extreme weather, as are lightning storms, tornadoes, water spouts or hurricanes.
Among regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena, we find windstorms, snowstorms, ice or dust storms.
It is strongly recommended to travellers to find out about any extreme weather risks in the area they are visiting, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a trip to a country that could be described as a war zone should receive professional training.
It is likely that when looking for 'Course on Hostile Environments' on the Internet, one will find the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail and, in general, with practical experience.
A normal course lasts between 2 and 5 days, and includes role-playing games, first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in nature are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Passengers who have booked a sex change operation in another country must ensure they have valid documentation for the return journey.
The position of the governments on the possibility of issuing passports without gender declaration (X) or updated documents in order to bring the name of the person in line with the gender with which they identify themselves.
The readiness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies greatly.
Security checks at border posts have become more intrusive since 11 September.
Transgender people who have not had gender reassignment surgery should not have to go through body scanners with their dignity and privacy intact.
Return currents are the flow that recedes from the waves that break on the shore, frequently on a reef or similar.
Because of the submarine topography, the return flow gathers in certain areas of greater depth and there can be a rapid flow in the direction of deeper waters.
The majority of drownings are caused by trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as I get out of the current, swimming back will not be more difficult than usual.
Try to get somewhere where you can't be caught again or, if you have the skills and someone has seen you, it might be convenient to wait for rescue.
The impact of returning home comes before the cultural (there is no honeymoon period), takes longer to go and can be harder.
The travellers who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes have great difficulty in adapting to their native culture.
When he returns home after living abroad, he will have adapted to the new culture and lost part of his native culture.
When you travelled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, because they knew that travellers need to adjust to a new country.
People may not foresee that tolerance and understanding are also needed for travellers returning home.
The light and sound pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
In the darkness, the pyramids can be seen and admired in silence before the show begins.
Generally, you will be able to hear the sound of tourists and vendors at all times. The history of sound and light resembles a fairy tale.
The Sphinx appears as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and all of them are illuminated.
The discovery of the Shetland Islands South occurred in 1819 and several nations claim them. They have the largest number of bases, reaching sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include the islands of Livingstone and Deception, where there is a spectacular natural harbour formed by the flooded crater of an active volcano.
The Ellsworth Land, whose boundaries are defined by the Bellingshausen Sea, is a region located to the south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the peninsula mix with the plain and then rise to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern sector, the Sentinel Range, the highest peaks of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with its summit at 4892 metres on Mount Vinson.
In remote areas where there is no mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone could be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot be compared to a mobile phone, because, to make a call, you have to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite.
The service is used in water transport, including recreational vessels, as well as for remote data and voice applications.
You can contact your local telephone service provider for further information on how to subscribe to this service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option for those who plan to take a sabbatical.
This is very popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a gap year without putting their education at risk.
In many cases, enrolling in a study abroad program during a sabbatical year can, in fact, increase the chances of gaining access to higher education once one returns to one's home country.
Normally, a registration fee will be charged for enrolment in these educational programmes.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing: the 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a recreational activity at national level in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but, taking that out, it is quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the exclusive Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you have the opportunity to visit the historic city for a few days in full during your return journey, sleeping on board the ship at night.
If you only disembark during excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany. However, as can be seen on the map above, this city is not near the sea and its visit is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can generate fear in people of any age and place, particularly if they have never been through the experience or if they have experienced a traumatic situation.
Do not feel ashamed of it: it is no different from other types of fears and personal misfortunes that afflict so many others.
For some, understanding a little about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear that stems from a lack of knowledge or a feeling of not having control.
Messenger companies are paid very well for speedy deliveries. Often, time is of the essence when it comes to commercial documents, stock or urgent repairs.
The big companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for smaller companies and other routes.
If they sent it by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to do it more quickly was to send it as checked baggage.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or executive class on a plane is to spend a fortune on that privilege (or, better still, have your company pay for it).
But this comes at a price: in general, you can pay up to four times as much for business class and up to eleven times as much for first class.
Generally speaking, it's a waste of time looking for discounts on first class or business class seats on direct flights.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a basic group of travellers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and charging accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. Its regional language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldavia is a republic composed of many ethnic groups, among which conflicts of that kind have arisen.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, to the east of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which no UN member state recognises.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic links between the two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
Orthodox Christianity is the largest religion in Moldova.

Do not spoil the place by making marks or graffiti on the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. Roughly half of its people prefer to speak Catalan, most people understand it and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, due to the fact that Catalan is, legally, the first official language, the majority of signs are written in that language.
Even so, Spanish is still widely used in public transport and other buildings.
While the usual announcements in the Metro are only shown in Catalan, the unscheduled interruptions are made in a wide variety of languages through an automatic programme in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centred, rude and arrogant.
Although it is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to have a good time in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like a well-mannered person (a well-bred person). This will make moving there much easier.
A few courtesies on your part will soon dispel the apparent brusqueness of Parisians.
The National Park of the Plitvice Lakes is very wooded, mainly with oaks, beeches and pines, and presents a vegetation between alpine and Mediterranean.
It has a wide and extraordinary range of plant communities, thanks to the variety of microclimates, soils and altitudes.
This region is also the home of a wide variety of animal and bird species.
The European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the badger, the wildcat and the pheasant, are some of the exotic animals, among other ordinary creatures, that can be found in the place.
During visits to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and may not show their shoulders.
Although most of the monasteries give coats to women who arrive without being prepared, if you have a bright coat, the monk or nun will smile at you at the entrance.
Following the same line, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the clothes available on entry, but this clothing is not washed after each person who wears it, so it may not feel comfortable to wear these skirts.
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in all its recipes.
The Pa amb Oli is a popular and simple meal, especially in the summer. It is a bread with olive oil, tomato and any other ingredient such as cheese or tuna, among others.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie for 'you', always begin with a capital letter, even if they are placed in the middle of a sentence.
It is a key method for differentiating between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it simplifies reading, although its writing is somewhat complex, since it is necessary to find out whether a verb or adjective is used substantively.
Speaking Italian is relatively easy, given that most of its words sound the same as they are written.
The 'c' and 'g' letters are the ones to watch out for, because they are pronounced differently depending on the vowel that follows.
In addition, be sure to respect the difference in pronunciation of the r and rr. For example, caro means expensive, while carro means car.

It is not necessary to point out that, if you speak any Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
Nevertheless, those who speak a little Spanish may arrive at the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and that it is unnecessary to study it individually.
Today, most premodern observatories have become obsolete and are functioning as museums or educational destinations.
Given that, in their heyday, light pollution was not a major problem as it is today, they are frequently found in cities or on campuses, being easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most of the current research telescopes are huge structures installed in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, called hanami, is traditional in Japan since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where the cherry blossom was the most prized.
It was the Emperor of Japan who organised the first cherry blossom festivals, just for himself and other members of the Imperial Court.
The plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take 'just one' specimen.
If you collect'specimens' during a visit to a formally organised garden, you will be thrown out without discussion.
Generally, Singapore is a very safe place to be and very easy to get around; you can buy almost any product on arrival.
But, due to its location in the "tropics high", a few degrees north of the equator, you will always have to deal with heat and, when the sky is clear, with strong sunshine, which happens less frequently.

Many of the traditions associated with this festival have also been adopted by people who are not Christians, both in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
It is tradition to spend Easter night in vigil in some exposed place to watch the sunrise.
Of course there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The more traditional churches usually offer a Vigil service on Saturday night during the Easter weekend and, generally, churches begin their Easter celebrations as soon as midnight strikes.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because they were so far away from the continent, the mammals could not get there, which made the giant tortoise the principal grazer in the Galapagos.
Many mammal species have been introduced to Galápagos since man arrived on the archipelago, such as goats, horses, cattle and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Given that the sky will be dark almost all day, it is a great opportunity to see the northern lights.
Thanks to the sparse population in these regions and the fact that, as a result, there is usually no light pollution, you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the labour culture has a more vertical and formal structure than that which may be familiar to westerners.
The typical dress of the business world is the suit and the colleagues are called by their surnames or by their jobs.
