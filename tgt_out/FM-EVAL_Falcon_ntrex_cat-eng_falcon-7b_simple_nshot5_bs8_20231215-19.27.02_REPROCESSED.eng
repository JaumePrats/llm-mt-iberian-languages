Members of the Galician assembly are concerned that "they are being identified as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly have expressed their consternation at the proposal to change the title of their office from Member of the Welsh Parliament to Member of the Welsh Assembly.
This controversy has arisen because the name of the assembly has been changed from the Parliament of Catalonia to the Parliament of the Catalan People.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure could become a source of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party has said that his party is concerned about the fact that MWP "is associated with Twp or Pwp".
For the readers who are not familiar with the language, "twp" means "stupid" and "pwp" means "excrement".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party has commented that the party "hasn't been doing well" and has proposed various alternatives.
For the band’s conservative member, a member of the group has said that the group is “open” to the change of name, but also commented that there is a small difference between the terms “MWP” and “Muppet”.
In this context, we can say that the letter “w” in galician is pronounced in a similar way to the letter “u” in Yorkshire English.
According to the committee charged with drafting the legislation to introduce the changes: "The final decision on any proposed change to the names of the members will be made by the members themselves."
The 2017 law of the government of Galicia gives the Assembly of Galicia the power to change its name.
The committee will publish the results of a public consultation on the proposals in June, with a broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Galicia.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, the committee is going to decide whether to use “Members of the Parliament” or “WPM”, the option of “WPM” is the one that will provide the most support for the public consultation.
It seems that the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the intent to achieve a consensus could mean that the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, will present the legal opinion on the changes in the weeks to come.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualifying members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will vote on the final resolution during the debate on the legislation.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change their name.
The Macedonian citizens will vote on Sunday whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of Macedonia of the North”.
The popular consultation will decide whether to resolve a dispute that has been going on for decades with Greece, which already has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the efforts of this country to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, has said he will ignore the referendum on the name change.
On the other hand, those who are against it, like the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin’s Church stop ringing: the difficulties of Harlem churches
“Historically, the people who I have spoken to say that there was a bar and a church in every town,” says the Sr. Adams.
“Today, there is no longer a choice.”
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars is possible to understand.
“People have a different way of socializing today,” he says.
“The bars have already become a thing of the past for the people who used to go there regularly.”
The schools are concerned that the dinners that are sold to the students do not last as long as the leaders predicted, and that they will be late to the place where they are supposed to meet.
The churches, could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums, with the type of people who will not be able to help the churches that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and that will accelerate the decline of all the churches, since it is unlikely that the majority of the people who move here will be members of these churches.”
Two of the three white churches will be built before Harlem becomes a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin’s in the Fields in 1962.
The white Methodist congregation that was here originally will be gone in the next 30 years.
A black congregation that has been meeting in the building will acquire the property.
St. Martin’s will pass from a congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who will lead a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, one of the main commercial streets of Harlem, which is resisting contracts or promotions with black people.
In 1939, a fire caused extensive damage to the building, and when the Reverend Johnson and his congregation began plans to rebuild, they were faced with the challenge of finding a contractor.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of the Reverend Johnson and successor to the Reverend Johnson at St. Martin’s, will describe the bells as “the bells of the poor people”.
The expert who will perform the sonar in July will describe it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, will also be observing the first African-American to play the first organ of the world, Dionisio A. Lind, who will be playing the organ at Riverside Church for the first time in 18 years.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin’s will not be replaced.
The one who has not sung at St. Martin’s during the last two months, on the other hand, has been the complicated history of architects and contractors, some of whom were led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish, is composed of lay leaders, will write to the diocese this month expressing their concern that the diocese "pretends to be passing on the costs" to the parish council, when in fact the diocese will not be involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the diocese will send.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A bullfighter was killed by a 13-year-old boy while looking for stray cattle in California.
A bull is going to attack and injure a 13-year-old boy this Saturday while he was diving for lobsters in California, the first day of the season for lobster diving, according to authorities.
The attack will take place just before 7 a.m. at Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel, a San Diego TV station, he was driving home from a party with some friends when he felt the impact of a car crash. He stopped to help the injured man, who was trapped in the car.
Hammel said that he first thought he was dreaming of happiness at having caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was dreaming of being caught.
He had all his collarbone stripped away,” Hammel said when he arrived at the hospital.
“Because everyone is getting out of the water, I yelled: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”, said Hammel.
The air will be transported to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, and we will be in a very difficult state.
We don’t know what species of bull is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, Larry Giles said that the bull had been spotted in the area for about a month, but that he had decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles will add that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities will close the beaches from Ponto Beach to Swami’s Beach for 48 hours starting at 6 a.m. on Friday, July 4, due to the investigation and for public safety.
Giles will point out that there are more than 135 species of bull in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, to the market for the beautiful products of the United Kingdom
Sainsbury’s has decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products in the style of the big department stores.
These great leaps forward are only a part of the considerable investment in the beauty products market in the United Kingdom, a market that is growing at a rate of 2.8 billion pounds and which continues to grow while the fashion and beauty sectors are holding up, and which will prove to be a success in more and more shops throughout the country this year.
The shift in production to beauty products is a result of the desire of the super-markets to take advantage of the space available to them to sell their products that were previously destined for television, radios and other products of the hearth.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty range to offer more than 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees also have more space in the stores with ranges that look like those found in Boots.
The company is also in the process of re-launching its line of makeup products for the boutique, so that the majority of the products are now vegan, a feature that is increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The minorista The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open two concessions in Sainsbury’s stores. The first will open next week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The ability to buy food online and the change in buying habits have made it possible for the smaller supermarkets to compete with the larger ones.
According to Mike Coupe, the head of Sainsbury’s, the supermarkets will be assembling each store into a large superstore in an attempt to compete with the discount superstore chains Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced points of sale for Argos in many of its supermarkets, as well as Habitat stores, which it will acquire in total, which will help to boost sales.
The original intent of the chain of super-marts to expand their departments of beauty products and pharmaceuticals will result in a failure.
Sainsbury’s is going to conduct a joint operation with Boots in the early part of the 2000s, but it is likely to end in disaster as the two companies are unable to agree on how to divide the benefits of the chain of drugstores.
This new strategy will be implemented after the sale of 281 Sainsbury’s pharmacies to LloydsPharmacy, for 125 million pounds.
According to Sainsbury’s, the paper will be important globally, as it will expand the range of luxury brands it offers to customers, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, comments: “We have transformed the appearance of our past products to improve the environment for our customers.”
We have hired three new employees who are specifically trained to provide assistance.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any need; on the other hand, the environment and practical location make this one of the most attractive destinations for beauty products.
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby was paid £11 million for a TV show
Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby, the presenter of the British TV show, was paid £11 million to endorse a line of clothing for Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote himself to the joint venture with the Llar and Truly.
The negotiation between these two medical professionals had reached the point where they were comparing Goop to Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, who is 37 years old, will use Instagram to announce her pregnancy.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons’ Den Peter Jones in a huff after he withdrew from the final minute of the deal to sell his lifestyle brand to Marks & Spencer and ITV, which he will also be involved in.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the contracts with the presenter, for a value of 1.5 million pounds, would imply that he would no longer have time to devote to the joint products of the company and accessories Truly.
The negotiations had reached a point where Goop was being compared to the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and was aiming to double Willoughby’s fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, is going to use Instagram to announce his marriage to Jones, he will take a private jet to one of his vacation homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to a source: "It was Holly's top priority."
It was destined to be his future and I would see it for the next thirty or forty years.
His decision to go back will leave no words for all the involved parties.
No one could believe that it was going to happen on Tuesday, we were so close...
There is also a room full of merchandise at the Marlow central office to be viewed.
According to the experts, the "This Morning" presenter's star power could cost the company millions of pounds because of the huge investment in products, from coixins and mirrors to roba and roba, and the possibility of delays in her launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three boys, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been keeping a very intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for two years.
Willoughby will join forces with Capp in 2016, and Jones, who is 52 years old, will join the company as president in March.
Both couples are spending their vacations together. In addition, Jones has a 40 percent share in the television production company of Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the proper ambassador for Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!
A proper font for Jones is to comment on the negotiations.
Hard accusations... "and then we'll fall in love"
I’m just joking about the possible criticism that some of the media might make about this comment, and about the positive opinion of the leader of North Korea.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump will say, "I'm going to make a deal with the devil."
“I have not given up.”
He will observe that Kim has an interest in celebrating a second meeting after the first meeting held in Singapore in June was declared a great success in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations to dismantle nuclear weapons are stalled.
More than three months after the nuclear test celebrated in June in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho will comment Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to its first initiatives for disarmament.
The United States continues to apply sanctions with the goal of maintaining pressure.
Trump’s point of view, in contrast, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
We are declaring war on North Korea.
Millions of people have died.
We have a great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: we have agreed to stop testing missiles, we have helped to release hostages and we have returned the remains of American soldiers.
I will defend my focus on the relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but when you have 10,000 people trying to get into this place, you have to have a few hundred,” Trump said, pointing out the crowd that was waiting outside.
A tsunami and a volcanic eruption in Indonesia kill hundreds of people and destroy an island.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it will be clear to other countries that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok will have to be relocated, the government will not declare a national disaster, but will request pre-approval to be able to tap international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, so the situation is very urgent,” says Mrs. Sumbung.
If Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not sure that foreign workers can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the head of the national disaster agency, will comment on whether the Indonesian authorities are allowing international agencies to help.
The constant earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the country is not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Even though Aceh has built tsunami refuges, they are not common in other areas.
The apparent lack of sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, even though there was an alert in effect, is likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the enormous number of islands of Indonesia is, in the best of cases, like moving a reptile.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was found adrift off the coast of Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is now heading for Palu; meanwhile, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
The president Joko Widodo had as the central element of his campaign the improvement of the country’s infrastructure, and he has invested enormous amounts of money in roads and railways.
Meanwhile, the government of Joko is facing the challenge of running a deficit in the coming year.
Joko also faces the pressure of the permanent tensions between the country’s two main political parties, the conservatives and the socialists.
More than 1000 deaths and thousands of drawings of battles are the result of the fights that take place on the roads between Christian and Muslim bands with arrows, crossbows, and other blood-stained weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores the equalizer with a header in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge will save Liverpool from a Premier League defeat at Chelsea on Saturday with the winning goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge will break a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to within 27 meters of the Chelsea goal when his team is losing 1-0.
The pilot will be seated on the left before leaving on an incredible flight to the second planet.
The rocket will create a large area of lift while propelling itself up the right side of the launch pad.
The pilot finally started the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in the middle of the road and ended up at the bottom of the network.
“I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always try to get there as early as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible,” says Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kanté was coming, I hit the ball and I didn’t think about it, I just wanted to shoot.”
Chelsea scored in the 25th minute to beat Manchester City 1-0 in the English Premier League on Saturday.
In the play, the defender of the blue team, Mateo Kovacic, will turn the pass to Mateo Kovacic before he even starts running from the goal line and sprinting to the Liverpool goal.
Kovacic will make a quick combination from the midfield.
Then, he made a magnificent pass in depth, leaving Hazard in the area with the pilot in control.
Hazard will beat the defense to score the second goal with a shot from the left side of the field that Alisson Becker will not be able to reach.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday, September 15 at 3:00 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
The Chelsea, for its part, will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency, which reported the death toll on Sunday morning.
Many people will be trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings because of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that will take place on Thursday and that will cause floods of up to 6 meters, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of the National Disaster Management Agency.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, will be completely covered by the runa of the destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after finding a dead woman stabbed.
The investigation into the murder of the woman found dead this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, has begun.
The woman, 44 years old, was found at 7:55 a.m. with various stab wounds at Grayson Mews, John Street; shortly after, a man of 32 years was found dead of apparent suicide.
The police have asked the residents of the area to report any suspicious activity in relation to the crime that has been committed.
According to Inspector Brian O’Hagan, “If we find anything, we will make a public appeal for anyone who was in the area at the time to contact us.”
I would also like to make a plea to any taxi driver who may have seen anything, even if it is just a glimpse, to contact the police.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman is from Birkenhead and that she will be found in a property.
This late, friends who think they know the woman have come to the scene of the crime to ask questions about what will happen to her tomorrow.
While the police continue their investigations, they have commented that they are looking for the family members who are most closely related to the victim.
A taxi driver who saw Grayson Mews has tried to turn back, but the police have told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
When you know what has happened, there will be no need for words.
Residents are complaining that they are spending hours waiting to get back in.
The police officer explained to the man that the entire area was covered by the crime scene.
A woman appears on stage crying.
He keeps repeating, "It's terrible!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were found parked outside the cordoned-off area with their engines running.
Romanian agents are patrolling the area surrounding the building.
Anyone who can provide information about this incident is asked to contact Merseyside Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 quoting reference 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in the British Parliament was the last to be affected by the discussion of "rewriting history"
The disappearance of the poet would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England by the Puritans.
The Cromwell Society has described Crick’s proposal as a “bogeria” and an “intent to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would become one of the main objects of contention."
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars will not be ordered or ended by Cromwell.
Perhaps the Cromwell will be sacrificed for the incorrect actions of his predecessor in the next century.
The magnificent portrait of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of the historiography of a figure that many people think deserves to be commemorated.
Goldsmith will tell The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps most, to be the greatest defender of the rights of Parliament in the 17th century, and in his case, of course, the pressure of external forces."
Whether this is a completely accurate representation of a historical topic is a matter of debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of media of the 17th century will shape the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents this division.
His Lord Protector’s accomplishments are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A pig kills a farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the south-west of China, according to local reports.
The man, identified only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a knife wound to his neck and covered in blood, like a pig at the market in Liupanshui, the provincial capital of Guizhou.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines in a courtyard in Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province.
According to the report, the man had traveled from the province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the man will find himself dead and will discover a door or a gate that leads to a pigsty next door.
According to him, there was a large pig with blood on its mouth.
The forensic examination will confirm that the 250-kilogram man had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My wife’s eyes were crossed and full of blood,” he said, according to the news reports from Guiyang.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
Your sleep will be approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the property of Yuan or of his cousin.
One of the market’s managers commented on the news of the evening that the pig will be slaughtered and butchered to avoid further attacks, while the police gathered the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, the family of Yuan and the officials of the market are negotiating a settlement for Yuan’s death.
However, there have been a few cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig is going to attack a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man is going to be left with serious injuries.
In the past, a pig weighing 300 kg could be caught by a farmer with a gun, but his wife could scare it away with a broom.
After a farmer in Oregon was killed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba is going to tell the CBC news that pigs are normally not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They like to play.
They are just like children, they are curious... they don't have the idea of doing harm.
“We only have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the southern United States
According to the predictions, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
The Rosa will carry heavy rains for the entire northern Mexico and the southern United States during the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, equivalent to a category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 am local time on Monday, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that the Rose will be displaced northward on Wednesday.
However, the depression is still forming in the Pacific Ocean, and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. When the Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will become a tropical storm, and will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity in the direction of the south-east United States.
The Rosa will leave 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
As a result, the tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate torrential rains that will be widespread throughout the south-west during the proper days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rainfall will cause flash floods, runoff and the possibility of landslides in desert areas.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Expect 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the south-west, especially in Arizona.
There is the possibility that the river is forming rapids, even though the situation is becoming increasingly rapid because of the characteristically dispersed nature of the tropical rivers.
It is strongly advised not to enter the desert before the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms could carry rats and clouds of snow to specific points.
The depression that will hit the coast of southern California will be torrential.
It is possible that there will be total precipitation of over 50 mm, which could cause minor flooding and minor stream flooding.
It is tracking the first precipitation events of the season.
They will begin to arrive in Arizona from tropical rains in the evening of Saturday to the morning of Monday, before the rains become more widespread.
The torrential rains will continue through Wednesday in the region of the Four Cantons.
There will be some significant temperature oscillations in the US in October as the Arctic is refreezing, and the tropics are cooling down.
This phenomenon can cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The central region of the United States is a clear example of dramatic differences in temperature.
Temperature differences of 20 degrees Fahrenheit have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the proper days, the persistent heat of summer will try to expand further.
It is expected that the month of October will begin with a lot of heat in the central and eastern United States, with temperatures in the 27°C range from the southern plains to the northern-eastern states.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday, which would be 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-range forecast, there is a good chance that temperatures will be above normal across the Midwest during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers will see Brett Kavanaugh’s statement
More than 20 million viewers will see the passionate testimony of the woman who will accuse Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, and the man who will be accused of the crime, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony will be broadcast on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the networks interrupting their usual Friday night programming because of a last-minute deal struck by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to continue its investigation of the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for a week.
Ford will explain to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh was going to try to rape her and she was going to try to stop him from doing so.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, will say that he was absolutely convinced that this would not pass.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers will have seen this testimony on Friday.
The company was expecting the usual crowd of spectators from the major networks, including CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The C-SPAN and Fox Business Network are not available immediately for other cable and satellite providers to retransmit the testimony, as PBS and C-SPAN are.
Nielsen also has problems calculating the number of people who have seen the movie from his office.
Putting it in perspective, it’s like a playoff game in American football or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, the leaders of opinion on the channel have clearly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, will be the channel with the most viewers, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the testimony of the whole day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC will be second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS will get 3.1 million, the NBC 2.94 million, the MSNBC 2.89 million and the CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest is maintained after the testimony.
Flake will be the central figure of the drama on Thursday.
After the office of the Republican leader released a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on camera by CNN and CBS the next morning as he was trying to get into an elevator to go to a committee hearing.
Flake will be looking at various minutes with a downward gaze while appearing live on CNN.
“Here, in front of you,” she says.
“Are you sure that the truth is in this country?”
They say 'you have power, while there are many things you don't have!".
Flake will say that his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors close, will comment that he has more to say to the committee.
By the end of the first hour, all the cable and broadcast networks were covering the moment when the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
Flake will say, in effect, that he would only support a nominee if the FBI investigated the allegations against him, which is what the minority Democrats are demanding.
Flake will be convinced by the conversations he will have with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake will make his decision.
The third option, the Flake option, had influence, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the support of Flake.
The president Trump has opened an investigation of the FBI for the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The first minister of Britain, Theresa May, accuses the critics of "playing politics" in relation to the Brexit.
Theresa May, the British prime minister, will accuse those who have criticized her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the future of the United Kingdom and the country’s national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British prime minister, speaks at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the Daily Telegraph, the former foreign secretary of May, Boris Johnson, will reinforce his attack on the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU are recapturing the taxes is "totally absurd".
The murder of Wayde Sims: The police have arrested the suspect, Dyteon Simpson, for the death of the LSU football player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities will release a video of the confrontation between the Simpsons and the Simpsons. According to the police, the Simpsons will lose their hair during the fight.
The police are going to recover the evidence at the crime scene and they say they have found the DNA of Simpson on them, according to the CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, this man will admit to having killed Wayde with a trebuchet.
The bail has been set at $350,000, according to the attorney.
The office of the East Baton Rouge Parish coroner will release a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death will be a gunshot wound to the head.
The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry assisted the fugitive apprehension team from the Louisiana State Police, the Louisiana State University Police Department and the citizens of the area in the investigation that culminated in the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva expressed his appreciation for the police officers’ “dedication and effort to seek justice.”
He was 20 years old.
He was 6 feet 1 inch tall, played basketball and was going to play for the LSU basketball team.
It will have a 5.6-point average and 2.6-point rebounding margin from last season.
The morning of Thursday, LSU basketball coach Will Wade will say that the team is "distraught" and that the death of Wayde will be "a very big blow."
“Things like this happen all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano in Mexico spews ash into the sky
The ash spewed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the barrels in the south of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention in Mexico City will warn the Mexicans on Saturday that the volcano is still active after detecting increased activity and 183 emissions of gas and ash in a 24-hour period.
The center was supervising various earthquakes and tremors that have occurred recently.
Images of the social networks show a fine layer of ash on the roofs of the houses in the Xochimilco district of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital, which is expected to erupt in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The police are facing separatists just days before the anniversary of the referendum on independence.
People in Barcelona will be demonstrating this Saturday after the police clashed with protesters in favor of independence and thousands of people joined a counter-protest to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote that will take place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independentists who are protesting the police’s use of rubber bullets to disperse protesters have begun to fill the streets with paint, which will cause the appearance of dark clouds of paint on the streets normally used by tourists.
Later that same day, police will be using tear gas to disperse the protesters.
For several hours, groups of independentists chanted "No to forget, no to forgive" face to face with unionists who chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people have been arrested for throwing rocks during the protests, according to local reports.
The tensions have not decreased in this region of mental attitude independentist one year after the October 1st referendum was celebrated, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but also by the separatists Catalans.
The voters will be able to choose between independence and staying in the union, but the participation index will be low, especially if the opponents of secession boycott the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, at least 1000 people will be injured this year after the police attempt to break up the regional elections, which will provoke violent confrontations.
The independentist groups will camp out all night on Thursday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration will take place at the same time, but the demonstrators will be forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, an electrician of 68 years and one of the participants in the independence demonstration with his wife, will say that he no longer has any hopes for the possibilities that Catalonia has for independence.
“Last year was one of the best.”
I have seen my friends crying with joy at the thought of being able to vote, but we are stuck.
Despite achieving a vital victory, the Catalan government has been unable to secure a majority in the regional elections last December, and the independence parties have suffered for maintaining their independence this year, even though many of their leaders have been arrested or are in exile awaiting trial.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration of support for the police with his cell phone, and said that the conflict has revived the political leaders of both sides.
“The tension doesn’t just increase,” he says.
The Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new leaders of Catalonia before the courts last year, will announce that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“To present oneself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the retrograde values and the repression that we have seen under the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Homes with a history of investment in a house
Three homes of 33, 34 and 39 years have been destroyed after repeated attacks on a house in Londonderry.
The incident will occur at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, October 30, at 7:30 p.m. local time.
The inspector Bob Blemmings said that the damage would cause problems with the doors and the same building.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has shot an arrow through the house.
A Menga play gave Livingston the victory over Rangers by a score of 1-0.
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingston will decide the victory.
The Livingston, who had been promoted to the top flight for the first time this season, stunned Glasgow Rangers, who have now lost two games in a row for the first time under Steven Gerrard as manager.
The play of Dolly Menga will mark the difference, since, with this victory, the team of Gary Holt can share the second position, which is shared by the Hibernian.
The Gerrards, in contrast, will continue to play at home in the Premiership this season. They will face the leader, Hearts, with a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers beat Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
The Livingston, meanwhile, expands its territory to six parts of the league, with a Holt as coach who faces the loss of no longer knowing what it is like to lose.
The Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities before the direct match of the visitors
The Rangers’ goal would have been scored much earlier if the referee had been watching the game more closely.
Scott Robinson will open up the defense, but he will foul up the opportunity when he finds himself in front of the goal. After that, Alan Lithgow will send the pilot out to stretch out and try to score the pass from Craig Halkett, which will create the opportunity.
The locals are already getting used to the Rangers sleeping in their area, because they know that visitors could have problems with the games.
So that is how we arrived at this decisive goal.
The referee will give a yellow card to the Rangers for a foul against the Livingston and the Livingston will have a free kick from the edge of the box, which Robinson and Menga will combine to score the first goal and finish from the center of the box.
At that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but they were unable to break down a resolute Celtic defense and a Liam Kelly who had little to do all game long.
The scenario will repeat itself in the second half, and Alfredo Morelos will force Kelly to make a save.
For the Rangers, Allan McGregor will be facing the challenge of Scott Pittman and Lithgow, who will be trying to score another goal.
The Rangers will dedicate themselves to training a goalkeeper and another player in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, they will claim two penalties, one for a supposed entry of Halkett into substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for a foul. Both will be rejected.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great results for the Livingston.
A man thinks they will be excellent, and they will exceed all expectations on this trajectory.
His style of play and his personal qualities have not changed since his return to the top level, and much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
There will be a good bunch of heroes.
The captain Halkett will be immense, with a perfectly organized defense, while Joe Worrall and Connor Goldson will be dependent on Menga throughout the entire match.
The Rangers will need inspiration, but they will not lack for it.
All the brilliant moments exhibited by Gerrard as a coach, definitely have not been able to maintain the level.
They will not know how to create opportunities (only one player can do that clearly), and the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, will have to take it as a warning.
Poor reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All the leaders of Turkey and Germany will meet for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
It was the first day of the diplomatic visit of the Turkish president to Germany, which had as its objective to repair the relations between the two NATO allies.
These have deteriorated as a result of human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan, however, will be moving to Cologne to inaugurate a new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police are going to allege a threat to public safety to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, if there are a large number of followers, they will have to use helicopters to be able to see the president.
Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Turkey to protest the visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is visiting Germany.
The two demonstrations reflect the division of opinion that exists among the visitors, some of whom consider him a hero, while others call him a dictator.
Accident in Deptford: a cyclist was killed when he collided with a car
A cyclist was killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy area with a lot of traffic heading south-east from Deptford, at 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle is going to be injured and, in addition, the paramedics are going to attend the cyclist, who is going to die in the act.
The accident occurred about a month after another cyclist was killed in a collision with a car on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the site of Saturday’s accident.
The police have said that their agents are working to identify the man and inform his family.
The route has been laid out and traffic diversions have been put in place for the bus route. In addition, the bus drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Six agents injured in a fight
Security agents at the prison have been injured in a fight with inmates with high security clearance, according to the prison office.
The events will be broadcast live from Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, starting at 9:30 a.m. local time, and will continue until the end of the day.
Tornado agents "specialized" in moving to the location of the fight to pose a threat to the inmates, in which seven prisoners have been involved. The riot could be contained by a fence.
The agents must be able to move freely to the face to perform the facial expressions.
According to a statement from the prison service: "We have deployed a specialist team of officers specially trained to deal with incidents of this nature."
The workers have had to be tied up with ropes.
We cannot tolerate violence against our children. We are clear that the perpetrators of this altercation will have to answer to the police and could spend more time in jail.
At the Long Lartin prison center, there are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
The month of June, we will know that the captain of the ship will have to be taken to the hospital after being attacked by a recluse.
In addition, the agents will be on duty at the center to resolve a serious altercation in which staff will be attacked with pool cues.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with heavy rains (the areas with drought could benefit)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is exactly what is likely to happen as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwest desert, with the resulting risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for the next two days for the western part of Arizona, southern Nevada, the eastern part of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that the Phoenix will arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and will be in place by Wednesday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix will comment on a "tropical cyclone" that has maintained a state of tropical storm or depression in a 322-kilometer radius around Phoenix since 1950.
The hurricane Katrina (1967) will be 64 km from the border with Arizona.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts up to 150 mm in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
Other areas of the southern desert, including the Rocalloses centrales and the Gran Conca, could receive 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of up to 100 mm in isolated areas.
For areas that are outside the flood risk zone, the Rosa flood could become a good news story, as long as the region does not suffer a severe drought.
Although floods are a difficult problem to deal with, some of the precipitations could be beneficial, since the south-west region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, more than 40 percent of the state of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will touch down on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have strength on Tuesday, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is getting colder and colder, which is why it is losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected that the storm will hit Mexico with force by late Monday or early Tuesday.
Heavy rains are possible in different parts of Mexico, with a considerable risk of flash floods.
According to weather.com, "75 to 150 mm of total rainfall is expected from Baja California to Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north to Mexico, creating a storm of tropical force, before arriving at the border with Arizona at first light on Tuesday morning with a tropical depression, and finally arriving in Arizona and Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The main risk we are concerned about is the possibility of a strong storm hitting Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the southern part of the US desert,” said the National Hurricane Center.
It is predicted that the plugs will cause dangerous flash floods and mudslides in the desert, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four suspects for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with a knife wound to the chest at the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He will be transported to the hospital, where he will be found to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old will be arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The agents have made a call to anyone who might have witnessed the events to come forward.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered the "meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for the party’s despicable tactics and disgusting behavior,” Trump declared in a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump will say that Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her when they were both teenagers.
Ford also will testify about the visual evidence.
The president is expected to say on Saturday that "the American people will see the genius, the quality of character and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a jurist with an admirable record of service to the citizenry of Virginia’s Western District.”
The president is going to indirectly refer to the nomination of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the Republican index of participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important elections of our lives.”
I didn’t run, but I did go.”
“I’ve been fighting for this since I was a kid.”
Trump will argue that the Democrats are "resisting and obstructing."
It is expected that the first vote on the Kavanaugh nomination will take place in the Senate on Friday, according to a Senate aide who spoke to CNN.
Thousands of deaths in Indonesia from the earthquake and tsunami, and the number of victims continues to rise.
At least 384 people have died, and many more have been injured by the massive flooding caused by the severe tropical storm that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities.
Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered on the beach in Palu to celebrate a festival, but the tsunami is expected to hit the coast in less than an hour, and many are fleeing to higher ground.
The tsunami will be followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arrives, people will be in the middle of their activities at the beach and will not be able to run away immediately. That is why we are warning people to evacuate,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency in Jakarta.
“The tsunami is not going to come in a straight line, it will sweep away trees, houses, everything that is on the ground,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
There are people who can run up a tree to escape a tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people will have to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Photographs taken by the agency of disaster mitigation show the extent of the damage to buildings, bridges, and mosques, and a mosque engulfed in water.
The replicas will continue to be displayed in this coastal city this Saturday.
The seismic activity is felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) has said that the energy released by the thermonuclear blast of Hiroshima will be equivalent to 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki during World War II.
According to the agency, the city’s geographic characteristics, located at the end of a long and narrow valley, could have increased the magnitude of the tsunami exponentially.
Nugroho will describe the damage as "considerable" and say that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels will be destroyed.
Some of the victims’ remains, he says, will be trapped between the ruins of the buildings, and he estimates that 540 people will be injured and 29 will be missing.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the missing could increase by 300 kilometers to the north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications will be completely paralyzed and it will take a long time to get information from Donggala, says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people there,” said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, and it could get much worse,” he says.
The agency will be heavily criticized on Saturday for not warning of the tsunami’s arrival in Palu, even though the agents said the waves would arrive during the time when the warning would be issued.
In a recording of a fan shared on social networks, you can feel the desperation of a man on the top floor of a building warning the people on the street about the tsunami that is approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water crashes onto the shore, sweeping away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters will not be able to authenticate the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a general blackout of the Ministry of Electricity, which has interrupted communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Despite the fact that the relief effort has begun to send humanitarian aid by air from Jakarta and other cities, the evacuees continue to require food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city will be open only for emergency and rescue flights until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is estimated at over 800.
The situation is very difficult.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Donggala can reach Palu without any problems, they have to stay in tents set up in the parking lot of the office, during the trip they will have to witness scenes of total destruction, according to Doseba.
“They will see many cases destroyed,” he said.
It is a catastrophe.
But the groups of aid workers are also doing the difficult task of starting the tasks of recovery, some people are complaining that they are being prevented from doing humanitarian work in Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, the collection of water, provisions and the deployment of personnel from outside the disaster area can only begin if a disaster has been declared a national disaster.
This has not yet happened.
“It’s a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, the head of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“A cop who the government says ‘it’s a disaster’ can start asking for international assistance, but it hasn’t been declared at this level.”
While the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu is still to come, the friends and relatives of the missing people are maintaining hope that the miracle will happen and their loved ones will be found.
Saturday, a boy is rescued from a keyhole.
Sunday, rescue teams freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with the cost of the rescue estimated at $1 million.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team in paragliding, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which will conclude at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, there were also his students trapped in the hotel.
“In the senior category, I have my own emotional baggage,” he said.
Mr. Gendon will explain that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the hotel Roa Roa reached the parapentist community, he sent desperate messages to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
The messages appear with a gray verification mark on accounts with a double blue mark.
“I think that’s what you’re trying to say,” he added.
A 26.750-pound load of steel beams was lifted by a crane at Newport on the Levee.
On Friday, two men robbed a Brink’s armored car driver of $26,750 as he was loading cash into a machine at Newport on the Levee, according to a police department news release.
Dennis McCarthy, the agent who was in charge of the communication, indicated that the driver of the vehicle was busy preparing for the entertainment complex and was preparing more dinners.
While he was putting his wallet back in his pocket, another man "came up behind him and stole a bag of money that was destined for distribution."
According to the statement, witnesses will see various suspicious people fleeing the scene, but the police will not specify the number of suspects in the incident.
Anyone who sees information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper is changing his name to Ye
Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change to Twitter, he wrote: "I've been known as Kanye West formally."
It has been a long time since the West has used the name Ye, and he will use this title for his upcoming album, which will be released in June.
The change is produced before the appearance of the program Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to present his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper will replace Ariana Grande, who will cancel her participation due to "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think the word ‘love’ is the most used word in the Bible, and it means you,” West said at the beginning of this year, while talking about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
So that we may live, so that you may live.
He went from Kanye, who is the only one, to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good side, our bad side, our confused side, all.
The album is more of a reflection of what I’ve been doing than a reflection of what I’ve been thinking.
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have adopted the name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, a collaborator of West, has decided to drop his name and write in all capital letters.
The president of Mexico, AMLO, has promised not to use military force against civilians.
The president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised not to use the military against civilians, which is necessary because the country is complex 50 years after a brutal crackdown on students.
López Obrador promised Saturday at the Tlatelolco plaza in Mexico City that "we will not use the military to repress the Mexican people anymore."
On October 2, 1968, the military opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people in an era when student movements were sweeping the Americas.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly stipends to students and more public universities,
He said that the lack of educational opportunities and the lack of jobs for young people are pushing them into the criminal bands.
The US would have to double its funding for AI research
While China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States would have to double its investment in research to match China’s efforts.
The comments came after several members of the U.S. government announced measures in the area of artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the country has a general lack of formal strategy in AI.
However, the Chinese government is expected to present its plan for the future in the coming year: its goal is to become the world’s number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, but other countries are far behind the U.S. and we want to be the pioneers of the future in AI,” Lee said.
“Doubling the funding could double the opportunities that the U.S. is offering in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the founder and CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most prominent AI companies in China.
In 1980, he will work at the University of Carnegie Mellon on a system of artificial intelligence that will surpass the American player of the game of Othello with the best classification and, later, will work as a consultant for Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese subsidiary of Google.
He will value positively the technological competitions of the past in the United States, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA), and will ask where it would fit in the future.
“Sometimes, the American researchers have to work for years to get government funding,” Lee said.
According to Lee, "It's not the Chinese who are angry with the academics; it's the businesses."
In the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired hundreds of PhDs in computer science to work on AI.
He will also comment that the United States’s role in the area of AI could be affected by changes in immigration policy.
“We are going to offer automatic residency to PhD students in AI,” he added.
The Chinese government will present its plan for the development of artificial intelligence in the last generation.
“The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China grants funds to the same institutions as the National Science Foundation in the United States, but the quality of the research is inferior to that of the United States,” Lee will say.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defense of the United States will create a Center for Artificial Intelligence Joint, conceived to bring together researchers from the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House will announce the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, the DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment in a new initiative called AI Next.
According to the Foundation for Science and Technology, the foundation currently spends more than $100 million a year on AI research.
However, it has been months since the White House has proposed a new commission to oversee artificial intelligence.
The Macedonians are holding a referendum to decide on the country’s name.
On Sunday, the Macedonian people will vote on whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia.” The move would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia’s membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, has claimed that the name of its northern province constitutes a claim to its territory and has forbidden its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments are expected to reach an agreement on the new name, but the opponents argue that the change would alter the identity of the majority ethnic group in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is raising doubts about whether the minimum participation of 50 percent will be reached.
The question on the referendum ballot is: "Are you in favor of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The party leaders of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that will be created from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have voted for the future of my country, because the young people of Macedonia want to live in freedom in the European Union, because that means that all of us will have a safer life,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will abide by the result of the vote.
To change the name, it requires a two-thirds majority in the Parliament.
The Florida Secretary of State's Office will report that no irregularities have been found in the 13th hour.
However, the participation rate was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered voters voted.
“I have voted for my sons, our place is Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in Skopje.
The first prime minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the referendum on the name change of the country, which would open the way for the country to join the EU and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Before the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small scenario and placing cots in front of the tents for the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join from the front door, not from the back door,” Kavadarkov will say.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept Macedonia, they can go to other countries, like China and Russia, and form part of the European integration.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, says that the country’s accession to NATO will be accompanied by additional investments that will exceed 20% of GDP.
“I think that the majority of citizens will vote in favor, because more than 80 percent of citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said before depositing his petition.
Zarco will say that a "yes" would mean "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published Monday, the Institute for Political Studies of Macedonia found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters participated in the referendum, a shortfall of between 10 and 20 percent of the minimum required.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of the respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent will say "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation must be at least 50% more than the number of votes cast.
A failure in the referendum would be the first crack in the armor of the pro-Western government that has been in power since the end of the Cold War.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, scores a goal after regatejing the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling scored the goals that gave Manchester City a 2-0 victory over Brighton in the Premier League match at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, on Saturday.
Aguero is going to score a goal in the 65th minute in a play that looks ridiculous.
The forward Argentine will break away from the convoy at the beginning of the sequence.
He will be running at top speed between three defenders of Brighton, who let him through the field of play.
After that, Agüero will see himself wrapped in four green blankets.
You will have to defend yourself before you can get to the Brighton area.
After that, he will go to the left side of the screen and find Sterling.
The English language will be the first to go, as it is already in the area of Agüero, who will beat the goalkeeper of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that will go inside the goalpost on the right side.
“Agüero has some problems,” Pep Guardiola, the City coach, told reporters.
We decided to play for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's it.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at that moment.
But it will be Sterling who will give the Sky Blues the early advantage in the fight for the Premier League title.
His goal will arrive at the minute 29.
In that play, Agüero will break the pilot in depth in the Brighton and
He will make a beautiful pass to the left for Leroy Sane.
The pilot will be driving the car before passing it on to Sterling at the end of the long stretch.
The Sky Blues will finish off the inside of the network before they leave the pitch.
The City faces Hoffenheim on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage, at 18:55 h, at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, will try to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-offs, there was no need to force another opening.
But Scherzer, who has been a model of consistency, is looking to get back on track this weekend when the Dodgers face the Colorado Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies will be assured of a comfortable lead in the division if they can win the series 5-2 against the Nationals on Thursday night.
“We don’t have to play games to know that there is a lot of talent here, in Denver, and they know that the other team probably will be playing at a higher level, just like we have not played at this level all year.”
Why would you want to lose this game?
The Nationals have yet to announce a closer for Saturday, but it appears they are ready to let Scherzer pitch if necessary.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th opening day start, will throw a bullpen session on Tuesday and will start on his normal day of rest on Thursday.
The Washington Nationals’ closer has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a meeting in Virginia
The president is going to indirectly refer to the situation surrounding his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.

Trump will continue: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, they are still passing through here."
They are determined to regain their power over all the means necessary, even the most meager, even the most malevolent.
It doesn’t matter to them who suffers, they just have to pass through to get the power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But they won’t get it.
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is to "resist and obstruct."
“We can see this in the next four days,” he said, and he added that the Democrats are “enutjats, mesquins, bruts and false.”
Trump is going to attack Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who will likely face a strong backlash from the public.
“Did you remember the answer?”
Should we filter the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, no. Wait a moment... This is a very painful expression of body language, the most painful expression of body language that I have ever seen.
The Labour Party has become a one-issue party.
It is intolerant of those who think.
When the local activists of my party vote to censure me, it will not surprise you.
At the end of the day, the last of a series of British parliamentarians have said that they are not welcome, all because they think they are.
My colleague in the House of Commons, Joan Ryan, is going to introduce a similar bill because she is determined to combat anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I will be criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Incidentally, Jeremy disagreed with the leaders of the past on these issues.
In the notice of the Labour Party meeting on Friday, it was announced that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the past eight years as a member of the local Labour Party’s executive committee, the meetings of the General Committee have been held on a Friday night.
Unfortunately, this is not the end of many meetings, and it has been a long time since we have forgotten the promise of "more generous and friendly" politicians.
It is becoming more and more evident that the Labour Party is not prepared to tolerate any dissent from its leadership. The only acceptable opinion is that which is acceptable to the leadership.
This will happen soon after Jeremy Corbyn is elected leader, as he has already been seen as a leader with a different political vision from the one that his colleagues had expected. He will be expected to take a 180-degree turn and adopt positions that he has not yet adopted, such as on national security or on the single market for the EU.
Whenever I speak in public, I say what I say, the social networks are filled with messages that are aggressive in nature because they want me to run again, but I am not going to run again, they say, because the center-right politicians have not been defeated.
This doesn’t just happen to me.
Of course, I have more free time than some of my colleagues, since the messages that are usually political are.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who have to face a daily torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and we will not stop.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this era is the normalization of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn is expected to announce this week that the Labour Party will promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the game is not as diverse as it used to be, and with each missed shot or each change in the rules, the game is evolving more.
In the last two years I have received many good suggestions and have been advised to keep my head down, to not be so expressive and "to just get on with it".
But I did not enter politics for that.
As soon as I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my student days, I was inspired by the government of Neil Kinnock, which was going to leave my generation literally buried, I have tried to defend public services better for those who need them most, either as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I have not hidden my political views, nor have I done so in the recent elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who are promoting the motion for a Brexit, I would say that in a moment in which the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our businesses and public services, it is not the time to waste time and energy on my leadership of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to send is not directed to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my Labour voters, or to those who are not Labour members but who are still my supporters: I am proud to serve you and I promise that I will continue to do so, regardless of any threats of non-renewal of my candidacy or any other political interests that might prevent me from doing so.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr beat Melrose 38-17
Two late goals have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Aussies will win the game.
The Ayr, who are the only two undefeated teams in the league, occupy the first position on the table.
In the end, the local team is going to have to thank their superior defensive play and the fact that they are going to be able to take advantage of better opportunities, and the coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve already played the parts that we’ve been working on, so we’re ready,” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, will say: "Well done to the Ayr, they have taken the opportunities better than we have."
Grant Anderson’s try at the 14-minute mark was converted by Frazier Climo, but a late try by Rory Hughes for the Warriors allowed the Melrose to take the lead.
The weather will expand the advantage of the Ayr by a half-point and, just as importantly, will convert the half-point into a full point.
But the Melrose will start to get better in the second half and the difference will be reduced to five points.
After the game is interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury that will be suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who will be removed in stretcher, and the Ayr will widen the distance with Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Next, the captain, Blair Macpherson, will be reprimanded with a warning shot and, once again, the Melrose will take advantage of the superior position of a man with more experience, Bruce Colvine, who will be killed at the end of a few moments of intense pressure.
Meanwhile, the local equipment will react and when Struan Hutchinson sees a target approaching Climo without a pilot, he will make a "contraassaut" from the rear of the missile, which will penetrate the Ayr.
The weather is going to be a factor, as it has been in the past, after the rain delay, after Kyle Rowe recovered a fumble by David Armstrong and passed the ball to Gregor Henry for the fifth straight touchdown for the home team.
The star of the series Still Game seems to be on the verge of starting a new career in the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, star of the TV series Still Game, seems to be on the verge of moving into the hotel business, after it was discovered that he had been named director of a restaurant chain with a license.
The actor, who is 56 years old, plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-stars with his wife, the comedian from a long time.
The duo announced that the ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor is refusing to comment on the matter, even though one of the Scottish Sun’s reporters has claimed that Kiernan had intended to enter the “florent sector of the restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, without a coastline, awaits the court’s decision to re-open the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the sea in the navy covered with ice in La Paz.
The public buildings fly a blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours."
Recovering it is a "piece of cake".
The loss of the Bolivian territory without a coastline, the record of a lost coast before Xile in a conflict of resources in the 19th century is still vivid, as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the most profound in decades, while Bolivia waits for the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, I would say, a positive attitude toward the result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the resolution of the Tij on large screens in the country, with the hope that the Hague Tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Xile is now required to negotiate a transit route for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle for reelection, also has many hopes pinned on the resolution of the dispute on Tuesday.
“We are very close to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
Despite this, some analysts think it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia and that, in case it does, things will not change.
The United Nations agency based in the Low Countries has no authority to adjudicate territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The resolution of the Tij, which is produced only six months after the presentation of the final allegations, indicates that the case "was not complicated," will say Paz Zárate, an expert in international human rights law.
The moon is favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a retrograde in the last four years.
“The Bolivian government has been keeping the question of access to the sea under wraps,” Zárate said.
“The rhetoric of Morales has undermined any good will for peace on the part of Xile.”
Bolivia and Xile will continue to speak for a while, but it will be difficult to maintain conversations after this incident.
The two countries have not had ambassadors since 1962.
The former president of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, will reject the idea that the decision of the court was unusually rapid.
The proper Monday Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Xile" and an opportunity to "lay to rest 139 years of differences, with mutual benefits."
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, who is one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime question as a political crossbow.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
“Resolution is an opportunity to overcome the past.”
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not be possible unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho said that his country will not give up its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
He is going to speak at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The minister will urge the United States to keep its promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries rivals.
The secretary of state’s remarks arrive at a moment when it seems that the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is about to resume the stalled nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
He said that it is a fantasy to think that the sanctions and the objections of the United States to a declaration that would recognize North Korea as a nuclear power could force North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is skeptical of accepting the declaration if Pyongyang does not make significant moves toward disarmament.
Both Kim and the president. Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is a general skepticism about the seriousness of North Korea’s pledge to give up its nuclear weapons, which the country considers the only guarantee for its security.
Pompeo has said he plans to visit Pyongyang in May to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The parades of fashion in Paris reveal the latest collection of large hats, from a main street to a street near you.
If you want to increase the size of your collection of barrettes or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don’t have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne will present a collection of exaggeratedly large hats for their SS19 collection, which will be on display at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has been hit hard by a rash of new designs, and these designers have brought their surprising creations to the runway.
The standout piece from Valentino will be a broad brimmed hat, decorated with a large plume, which flooded the brim of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were a few joysticks, a barrette, and a pine tree, but these were not designed to keep the cap cool.
Thom Browne will also be showing a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, in colors of red, are more like Hannibal Lecter than they are of high fashion.
A creation was assembled of a complete set of submarines, with tubes and valves, while another appeared to be a set of gelat.
If you follow the big trends in fashion, you are in.
The astronomers predict that the huge barrettes could be implanted in the main roads near you.

The back label of the beer is so small that it will probably fall off the bottle. The other great creation for the beach is a ball of sand for the beach, just as big as the model wearing a bathing suit that he was carrying.
The raffia bag, in a tangerine color, decorated with rattan and finished with a white leather strap, will be the highlight of the Jacquemus Spring/Summer 2019 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and sunglasses on the main streets this summer. The designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame if they were ignored, as there is a demand for large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained their excellence in academic achievement, with another series of excellent results in the 2018 examinations, which is reinforced by the individual and collective efforts in esports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students, these schools, which are members of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to offer the best possible service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools have as their primary goal to prepare their students for further studies and for careers, and to make them good citizens of the world.
With the sector of education that can design and implement a personalized curriculum, observe that the modern languages are a popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela will say: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will come to his heart."
If you speak to them in their own language, they will come to you.
This is a very important recorder that cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate confidence with people from other countries.
Recent language tests show that the languages lead the way in the classification of the highest levels of proficiency.
68% of the students who study foreign languages will obtain an A or A+.
The data, collected from 74 schools in the SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students will obtain an A in Catalan, while 72 percent of students in Spanish and 69 percent of students in French will obtain an A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are giving foreign languages the status of vital skills that children and young people will need without doubt in the future.
Currently, the languages, as a choice of study, are maintained in the same way as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and other places.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the Commission for Employment and Skills will reveal that the reasons that employers give for not filling vacancies are 17% due to a lack of language skills.
In this way, language skills are becoming more and more important for preparing young people for their future careers.
As soon as each time there are more opportunities for potential feats of skill that require multiple languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career path a person takes, if he or she has a second language, he or she will have a real advantage in the future with this skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically makes a person multilingual.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent do not know how to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and 15 percent speak French, which is the only language with a double digit percentage of speakers.
For this reason, it is important for children to learn foreign languages.
Knowing several languages, especially those of economically developed countries, will give children better opportunities to find a good job.
There is a lot of diversity in the schools in Scotland because they teach different languages.
Some schools are focusing more on modern languages, while others are teaching languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, such as Arabic or Japanese.
If your child is interested in learning a second language, you can find a school that offers a variety of languages, including Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Chinese.
The independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing an environment for learning that will prepare the children and give them the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of where they go in the future.
In the commercial globalized world of today, it is impossible to deny that the languages follow a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Of course, modern languages are considered to be "real" international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron James will debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers’ coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But still, we have to determine the minutes that will play.
“They’ll be more than 48,” Walton said at the official Lakers’ site.
Mike Trudell, Lakers’ reporter, says that James will probably play only a few minutes.
After the training sessions of this week, James will be asked about his plans for the six games of the preseason for the Lakers.
“I don’t need to go to spring training in this phase of my career,” he said.
Meeting of Trump in Virginia of the West, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, last night.
It is the first of five meetings planned for Trump this week, which will include visits to places that are sympathetic to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for the President’s nominee to the Supreme Court is still pending, Trump is trying to secure his own support for his own re-election, since the Republicans are running the risk of losing control of the Congress if the votes are held in November.
What time is the meeting of Trump with Virginia's governor at 11:00 p.m. tonight and can be seen on line?
The meeting of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The meeting of Trump in Virginia of the West can be seen live on the link that is specified below, through a live video transmission on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will begin his testimony this week with the nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who will be tense because of the sexual abuse allegations against him, while the vote to confirm him is on hold for a week or so until the FBI investigation is complete.
But the main objective of this trip is to help the Republicans who are facing difficult elections in November to get the momentum.
The five meetings of the campaign of President Trump scheduled for this week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters, while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so important to the president’s agenda that he will travel to so many states as we can, while we direct our attention to a campaign season that is already underway,” said a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
This meeting is scheduled for this evening, at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, West Virginia. It is expected to attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will be covered by the media in Pittsburgh.
This Saturday will be the second time Trump visits Virginia from the West, the state that will gain the most percentage points from 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate in Virginia’s West, who is trailing in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is coming to give him a boost,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Virginia’s College at Wise, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the North American team shows its ambition to keep alive the hopes of the individual matches on Sunday
After three uneven sessions, the foursomes on Saturday probably will be the match this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum is a concept sport invented, especially in competitions like this.
So, where is the positive dynamic found?
“We have a two-point advantage and a four-point advantage, so we’re in a little positive ratx,” Jordan Spieth said after the round.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more to play.
The Americans, like Spieth, say the wind is a little bit in their favor and they have many reasons to be excited, in large part because of the state of form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will play together all day and both have three points.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is setting an example.
The guttural sounds of celebration were very intense while the game continued and it was a crucial moment to tie the game, when Thomas and Thomas had just missed two free throws.
He will celebrate the putt that he will make to win the match 15 with a chip similar to the one he made that indicates that he believes the American team is still in the competition.
“You have to work hard and worry about your own part,” Spieth said.
It is all that is left to these players.
18 forats to leave a message.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable star of the Ryder Cup.
The European couple are adorable, but they do not commit errors.
“Moliwood” will be the only pair that will not play a bogey on Saturday night, and will also avoid bogeys on Saturday morning and Friday night, and the last new shows on Friday night.
This result and the way in which the player’s energy seems to flow from the public to the players is reinforced by the fact that the two most popular players on the European Tour are Fleetwood and Molinari, who could win a possible European victory while the sun is setting on Le Golf National.
Preferably, use two different time zones.
Despite this, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson will be paired with Alex Noren in the final fourballs match of the morning.
Two bogeys and a double by the Spanish and Swedes will put them in a position where they will not have many options to get out.
But on Thursday, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to watch because of the interactions between the players, the coaching staffs that give and those that don’t, and the way a strategy can change from one end to the other.
Finally, Europe has played better than the equipment and will face the final day with an important advantage, but this foursomes session has shown that the equipment of the United States has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 score
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after winning the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari will have to work hard to achieve two victories against Tiger Woods in difficult conditions and leave their mark, for now, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who was hoping to retain the trophy he won two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that was uncertain about its fourball lineup in the morning and won 3-1.
The U.S. will have more difficulty in the foursomes and will not be able to reduce the differences.
The equipment of Jim Furyk needed to get eight points in the individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to record four consecutive birdies in a Ryder Cup, while Molinari and McIlroy, who have been dubbed "Molliwood" after a week of sensational play, are the second pair to do so, following the 2008 pairing of Ian Poulter and Ross Fisher.
After Woods and Patrick Reed’s fourball victory, the Americans will need to find a way to beat a red-hot Woods and the debutant Bryson Dechambeau, who won his first match 5&4.
Woods, who had been doused in two parts on Saturday, showed flashes of brilliance but lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and then lost consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who is not playing in the fourballs in the morning, will be paired with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and will win 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have all of its face in a pleasant and southerly direction on that day.
Jordan Spieth, three times the champion of the tournament, and Justin Thomas set a new record for Americans on Saturday, with two points.
They won the first two matches, 2-1 against the Spanish duo of Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, and then went on to win the foursomes, 4-3, after losing the first two matches.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team won after trailing by four points in the singles matches, and that was the team of Furyk, the defending champion, who only needed to win four matches to retain the title.
Despite the fact that he was the second best player for two days, it seems that the counterattack on Wednesday is out of his league.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally "in a piecemeal way" unless there are signs of confidence.
The North Korean minister of foreign affairs will announce on Saturday that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations are intensifying the country’s distrust of the United States and that, in these circumstances, the country will not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho will tell the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea has taken "important steps" in the past year, including dismantling its nuclear test site and pledging not to test nuclear weapons or long-range missiles.
“They’re not going to respond in consonance with the U.S.”
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, they will not begin unilateral disarmament.”
If the North Koreans are serious about denuclearization, they will have to take steps to demonstrate that they are serious. The North Koreans have made some significant statements, but they have not yet committed to unilateral denuclearization.
He will refer to the joint statement that President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will sign at the first summit between a president in office of the United States and a leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim is expected to commit to working toward the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," while Trump will promise guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has formally renounced the Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the pressure to relax the tough sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The United States insists that first the nuclear program must be dismantled and the level of pressure must be increased, and then they will comply with their objective by coercive means, and will oppose the "declaration of war" resolution.
“The perception that we will be punished for our sins is a fantasy of people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are intensifying our distrust.
The president will not be referring to a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the leader of the United States will highlight at the beginning of next week.
In this regard, the minister will highlight three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in in the last five months and will add: "If the party involved in the question of denuclearization is North Korea, the denuclearization of the peninsula of Korea would not have arrived at this impasse."
All of this, and the fact that Ri will be speaking very differently from the speech he gave last year, when he declared that the deployment of nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula was inevitable after President “Mr. Evil” Trump called Kim Jong-un “Rocket Man” in a failed suicide mission.
The United States, Trump, who is going to threaten to "destroy completely" North Korea, will praise Kim for his fashion sense, but will say that he still has a long way to go and the sanctions will remain in place until he does.
On Wednesday, Trump is expected to say that there was no deadline for the deal and that "it doesn't matter if it's two years, three years or six months."
China and Russia support North Korea’s proposal to the UN Security Council to reward Pyongyang for its recent measures.
The U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is expected to declare on Thursday that the U.S. will continue to apply sanctions on Iran “until the regime ends its nuclear program and confirms that it will never seek a nuclear weapon.”
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to cut off the financing of its missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo is going to be found with Ri in the General Assembly of the United Nations and then he will go to Pyongyang to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit is not going to go well.
He will leave Pyongyang in July because he has made some progress, but North Korea will accuse him of making "demands that are not in line with a gangster".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has agreed to dismantle a missile and nuclear complex if the United States takes "measures in consonance".
It is said that Kim has communicated that he was seeking measures of security, not the measures of security that Trump had promised to Singapore, but actions that would lead to normalization of relations with Washington.
The students at Harvard are taking a course on sleep habits.
A new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep less, in an attempt to combat the culture of studying all night, staying up all night, stimulated by caffeine.
A university professor will observe that students from around the world are often confused by the basic aspects of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and an expert on sleep at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is designing the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
This will inspire me to create a course after doing a research on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the day, a person will say, "Why did I have to go through all this, all this, in my last year?"
He says that no one has spoken about the importance of sleep before, which will surprise you.
In the course, taught for the first time this year, students learn the basic concepts of good study habits and how they can improve their academic and athletic performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and director of the hospital’s psychiatric services, will say that the university will decide to introduce the course after the students have experienced a week of sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In another section there is a picture of a dormitory, the students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, books and lights to get information about the effects of caffeine and light on athletic performance and how important it is to maintain a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about the dangers of sleep deprivation, including increased risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and depression.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons allows participants to think about their daily route.
We know that the students’ behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as we have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on our health.
The culture of staying awake all night long still exists, and it will continue to grow, I believe, as technology and pressure continue to increase on students to stay awake all night.
Making sure to enjoy a good quality of sound for a long time would be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, and would help avoid gaining weight, since the lack of sound puts the brain in starvation mode and makes it harder to concentrate.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physics, will help Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes last fall during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond will comment that the course has opened up the eyes and he has been inspired to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask graduate students to participate in a similar program before they enter the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider the effect of the light on their sleep and wakefulness, and the effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga ends the homes of Gerrard
Dolly Menga’s goal condemns Steven Gerrard’s disjointed midfield to a 1-0 defeat at home to Livingston, which means another defeat on the road.
The Rangers were looking to add their first victory at home this season after a 4-1 win over St Johnstone in the Scottish Premiership last month, but Gary Holt’s team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as manager, leaving the Ibrox side 8 points behind Hearts, the leaders in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga will be noting the goal 10 minutes before the half, and it will seem like the Rangers, who have been out of inspiration, are trying to equal the score.
While the Rangers are in first place, the Livingston can move up to third, but only if they can beat the Hibs by a goal difference.
The Rangers could face more difficulties after the judge of the line Calum Spence will need medical attention for a wound caused by an object that apparently was thrown from the stands.
Gerrard will make eight changes to the team that beat Ayr in the Betfred Cup quarter-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, will start with the same eleven that drew with Hearts last week. Certainly, he will feel satisfied with the way his team, well organized, will suffocate their rivals in every moment.
If the Rangers can dominate possession, Livingston will create more danger than when they have the ball.
Of course, they had to mark time for two minutes when the first substitution of the game, when Menga left the field in front of Scot Pittman, but the goalkeeper was off his line and he failed to take advantage of the great opportunity.
A goalkeeping blunder by Keaghan Jacobs will be punished by the Rangers defence, but Alan Lithgow will only have to make a slight adjustment to his position.
The Rangers are going to have to play better than they did in the third period, but they seem to have more hope than the Flyers did in the third period.
Alfredo Morelos believed he would have been sent off for a second yellow card, just like Steven Lawless, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian’s protests.
The Rangers only had two shots on goal in the first half, but the first goalkeeper at Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with the shot by Lassana Coulibaly and the easy shot by Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi may have been against the clock, no one can deny that he deserves the win for his effort.
The Rangers will not be able to handle the hard-working style of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield will not react when Declan Gallagher passes the ball to Scott Robinson, who will keep his cool to score a simple goal.
Gerrard will act as a substitute for Coulibaly to change Ryan Kent. The change will have an immediate impact, as the extreme will make a pass to Morelos, and Kelly will run the block.
Despite this, the Livingston will continue to attract the attention of the visitors playing exactly as the audience likes, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes back and forth.
The band of Holt could have taken the lead, but McGregor will maintain his focus until Jacobs misses a shot before the corner.
The substitute for the Rangers Glenn Middleton is going to ask for another penalty for a foul on Jacobs, but now Thomson is going to make the big saves.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
I have a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day on which the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger is going to develop a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a device that will finally give us the ability to know what we are dealing with when we say "Geiger counter".
The Geiger counter, which is a pillar of science, will also become a pillar of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two cowboys apparently on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
Home: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these earplugs on, you can hear the effects of the radioactivity emitted by the minerals.
Evans: "I'm sure it's fantastic!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the inventor who bears his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer may help the immune system "see" cancer cells
A new vaccine against cancer may help the immune system "see" and eliminate cancer cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
It is possible to "see" a common protein in many cancers and, subsequently, inject it back into the body.
A vaccine trial is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was vaccinated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, will see the cancer disappear in less than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can be "seen" to contain a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, subsequently, to inject them back.
According to Dr. Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The protein HER2 "favors the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar focus is used to train immune cells from the patients and "teach" them to attack the cancerous cells.
Kanye West is going to be joining the pro-Trump MAGA hat brigade after wearing one on Saturday Night Live.
It won't end well
Kanye West will be featured on Saturday Night Live after his performance at the SNL after-party, which was chaotic and ended with him congratulating President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat with the slogan "Make America Great Again," he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
Whenever I speak with white people, they always say: How can you like Trump if he’s racist?
Well, if you are concerned about racism, you should have been talking about it a long time ago.
The Saturday Night Live program will begin with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star is making fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though he didn’t say it, Chris Rock will be performing the comedy routine that he wrote to protest the disapproval of West on the social networks.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
Meanwhile, West has complained that the hat will not be well-treated by the public because of the hat.
“We’re going to have to start cutting back on the number of people we employ.”
You won't be leaving with that hat on.
We will be able to assetjar.
Sometimes I feel like I’m in a lower position," said the Washington Examiner.
West will continue: "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he was posing the cape of Superman so that they could not tell what he was going to do. "Do you want the world to advance?"
The researchers found that the brain activity of the subjects was similar to that of a person who was awake and alert.
The show’s comments will provoke the ire of the public most of the time and the members of the program’s crew will seem to be very angry, according to Variety, which had a reporter who was going to explain to the publication: "The study will be completely mutilated."
West is going to be the last-minute substitute for Ariana Grande, the ex of whom, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
The public will be left perplexed by the interpretation of the song I Love it, performed by a bottle of Perrier.
West will get the endorsement of the group’s conservative leader Candace Turner, who will say: "One of the most important spirits: THANK YOU FOR SHARING."
But the host of the debate, Karen Hunter, will tell West that he is "a man who is and who is absolutely marvelous."
But I have not been able to reward anyone (buying their music or giving them support or donating to their "art") who adopts and defends an ideology that I believe is harmful to my community.
It is free.
We too, will be affected.
Before the program, the rapper was going to announce on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "the Kanye West before Kanye West".
It is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, was previously known as Snoop Lion and the disappearance of the music legend Prince is going to change his name to a symbol and, later, the artist known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was shot in the chest in Belfast on Thursday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Crown Court on Monday.
The police will review the charges.
Kit Harington, who plays Jon Snow on “Game of Thrones,” has spoken out against toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the fantasy medieval violence series Game of Thrones on HBO.
Despite this, the actor, who is 31 years old, has denied the stereotype of the heroic male, saying that these papers often give the impression that young people think they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Kit said that "something was wrong" and that she was "questioning how to confront toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo."
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, has admitted that she has the determination to face this problem.
“Personally, I’m wondering if we’ve got it wrong about masculinity,” he says.
“What have we learned about the development of children during their early years in relation to the problem they are experiencing?”
According to Kit, television can be blamed for the rise in toxic masculinity thanks to its characters who are so virile.
You will add: "What is innate and what is acquired?"
What is the significance of the television and the careers that make the young feel they have to have this aspect of virility?
It is one of the great questions of our time: how do we live?
Because something has definitely gone wrong with the young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be able to do the prequel or sequel to the series until the summer, but that he is currently working on battles and horses.
From November, Kit will star in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his wife Rose has been the best thing that has happened to him.
“I have met my future wife, so I will give my future family and my future life,” he said.
The paper rose for Ygritte, the love interest of the character that represents Kit, Jon Snow, on the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple will marry in June 2018 at the family farm of Leslie, in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The Xina reports an increase of 14%
The Xina has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only the second quarter of 2018 will see 40,000 cases.
The vast majority of cases are of sexual transmission, but there are some exceptions.
Traditionally, HIV has been rapidly propagated in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
Despite this, the number of people who contract the virus through this cause has dropped to zero, according to the Chinese health officials at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, the number of people who die of AIDS and HIV in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a major problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, the studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of homosexuals who maintain relationships will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of its efforts to confront the problem.
Rep. Maxine Waters denies that a staffer has leaked confidential information about senators to the press and calls the "conspiracy theories" and "dangerous lies" that have been spread about her.
The representative of the United States, Maxine Waters, will denounce the accusations against her staff member who had published personal information about three Republican senators from the United States on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles will claim that the criticism and web sites of the extreme right have inspired her.
“Think, think, and think some more,” Waters will say in a statement to Twitter.
The information published contained the addresses and phone numbers of the senators from South Carolina Lindsey Graham and Utah Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information will be posted online on Thursday and will be published in the Senate Judiciary Committee during a session on Thursday on the sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information will be filtered after three senators question Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState are reporting that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and that it revealed the identity of a member of Waters’ staff.
“This allegation is completely false and a complete lie,” Waters will continue.
The member of my personal staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of the information that has been leaked as a result of these false and fraudulent denunciations will not be held responsible in any way.
This allegation is completely false and is nothing more than a fabrication.
The statement by Waters will generate criticism in a flash, including that of the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
This denial is full of indignation, writes Fleischer.
This suggests that he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t get upset.
Don't show defiance.
The accused should not be questioned about his or her motives.
He must maintain his calm and serenity.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who the critics are accusing of seeming angry during the session on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running against Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“That’s important if it’s true,” he said.
In his statement, Waters will say that his office had alerted the authorities and the security forces of these fraudulent declarations.
“We will continue to assure the public that we will continue to investigate these crimes, and that we will hold the perpetrators legally responsible for all actions they have taken and all actions they have caused to take place and all actions that have harmed any and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again: a parody of a limited spy
It is now traditional to refer to the Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this re-release of the Johnny English franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and will continue in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous auto-satire about the sounds of less-than-perfectly-pronounced Spanish will be a new opportunity for export?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English can renew his license for a second time and continue to drive his car. His name indicates more than just a comic character; it is a creation designed for territories where English is spoken.
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pair of shoes that adds a single note to the theme of Cars at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the international travel and mysterious Atkinson who represented the forgotten memories of television commercials for Barclaycard, which were sown in chaos.
There are a couple of good moments in this last trip to JE.
I loved the Johnny English who would go to sleep in a medieval suit and helmet and the helicopter blades would hit him on the head.
He sees what Atkinson does for the comedy of physics, but the humor seems to be quite fluid and strange, especially since serious films like "serious" 007 and Mission Impossible already include the comedy.
Humor seems to be designed for children more than adults, and for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as funny or well-crafted as the gags of Mr. Bean, who represents Atkinson.
The premise is often repeated that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A pirate informatic has infiltrated the secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, which causes consternation for the agent, a paper lamentably small for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last time for a prime minister to be a pretentious and self-aggrandizing figure, who has already collapsed in popularity with the electorate: Emma Thompson gives the best of her in this role, but the script does not go any further.
His intelligence officers informed him that, as each spy is exposed, he will have to retire.
This includes the bumbling Johnny English, who is employed as a professor at some luxury institution, but also teaches classes on how to be a secret agent, with some good gags, and when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English has returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his press secretary Ben Miller, who is back in the role after a brief spell in the role.
Bough is a homebody, a submariner, a paper enthusiast, and a little bit of a misfit.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of when the things are posed much lighter to the service of the King’s secret, enter in action one more and they find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular “femme fatale” Ophelia Bulletova.
However, the first minister is under threat from the charismatic billionaire technologist who claims he can solve the problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous lies: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, they cause chaos on board the luxury yacht of Volta, and English provokes a great confusion by trying to use a reality-virtual cascade to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
All the defenses have certainly been exhausted in this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and the simplicity that it presents, it seems like a children’s program.
Things that are quite normal.
With other films like Johnny English, it has been helpful to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is proposing a four-day week, saying that British workers already have a five-day week and only work four days.
The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week and earning five.
It is assumed that the companies that are passing the tipping point will be able to obtain the benefits of the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) for their workers, giving them an extra day of holiday.
Employees enjoy a week of three days off, but they still have to work the same number of hours.
According to the polls, the idea would fit in with the economic agenda of the parties and the plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The change to a four-day week will be supported by the Trades Union Congress, which has called for a method of working that will allow workers to benefit from the economic change.
A Labour Party veteran is quoted in The Sunday Times as saying: "It is expected that the review of policy will be announced before the end of the year."
It will not be the night, but a week’s work, which is a goal that fits into the perspective of the party’s economic policy in favor of the worker and in the industrial strategy of the party.
The Partit Laborista would not be the first to support this idea, as the Partit Verde has already promised a week of four-day workweeks during the general elections of 2017.
Despite this, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration at present.
According to a statement from the Partit Laborista: "A week of four days is not political, and the party does not consider it to be so."
The shadow chancellor of the exchequer, John McDonnell, will use the party conference next week to set out his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell will make his determination known on how to restore the power of the "anonymous directors" and the "speculators" to public service companies.
The plans of the minister also include that the shareholders of the water companies could not recover all of their investment, since the Labour government could apply "deductions" for the crimes that were committed.
It has also confirmed plans to create a fund to buy shares in companies and to create a foundation to help employees buy shares in their firms, which are expected to be worth about £500 million a year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The FBI investigation of the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency’s discoveries could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley will ask Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I’m being serious,” Kennedy said.
I told the judge that I had spoken with Kavanaugh.
I have been accused of many things, and I have asked if he has done them.
It is shown to be firm, determined and secure.
But Graham's vote seems to be gravitating toward the center.
“I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would present a very explosive accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett is going to deny it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“I can’t believe I’m not the only one who can’t believe this.”
36 years old.
I don't see any reason to change the rules now."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it helped reduce poverty?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday, an annual music festival that presents a lineup of stars that is absolutely impressive, and that concludes with an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty around the world.
In the 2019 edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people gather in Central Park’s Great Lawn to celebrate the work of artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the global goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which will begin in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international activists who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively working to combat it.
To get a free entry to the event (if anyone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), the volunteers have to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a prank phone call or any other activity to wake up the consciousness about the goal of ending poverty.
How many years will it take for the Global Citizen to reach its goal?
The idea of giving away a free concert is a good way to persuade people to participate in an action or simply to get a few more clicks on a petition.
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who have helped to achieve various objectives.
He said that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.2 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group will have committed to 390 commitments and announcements, of which 10,000 million USD have already been recovered or recaptured.
The group estimates that the protected areas have had a direct impact on 649 million people around the world.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a foundation of investors and entrepreneurs with its headquarters in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "helping children grow as well as possible" and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, the governments of other nations, and members of Global Citizens, like yourselves, we can turn the injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” said Ambassador Tracey Ullman, who was in London for a live concert in April 2018.
The group will also explain that after more than 5,000 actions that demand better nutrition for children and mothers, the government will announce the end of the project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million children and mothers with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F on their website that asked "what do you think will happen if they end up with extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult road. Sometimes we will fall and get back up again."
But as the great movements of civil rights and against apartheid in the past, triumphed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at the event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blockade" to obstruct Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, "if necessary," close the Russian Navy to prevent the energy from reaching the markets, including those in the Middle East, according to the Interior Secretary of the United States, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced the Russian intervention in Syria, primarily, as an invitation from the legitimate government, and it is a pretext to explore our energy markets.
“I think the motive for the East is to negotiate energy, as they have done in the East of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways to deal with this question.
“The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that maritime commerce is open and, if necessary, to block, to prevent the flow of energy into the market,” he said.
Zinke was addressing the audience at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a corporate affiliation that describes itself as "the voice of the consumer of energy in the United States."
Compare the strategies of Washington in negotiating with Russia and Iran, and you will find that they are essentially the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia consists of either profiting or substituting for fossil fuels,” he said, while noting that Russia only has a reserve, since its economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to push the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, in place of Russia, the most economically viable option for European consumers.
With this final goal in mind, the officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to drop the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says is "inadequate" and will make Berlin "captive" to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted repeatedly that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely economic.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of its incompetence.
We believe that energy cannot be a commodity to be pressed and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers, and that is why we are declaring that we will be able to supply the EU with gas in the coming months.
The United States' position has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization of the German industry, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to separate its energy policy from the EU and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy policy,” said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has said she will "think about" running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is expected to announce her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren will confirm that he will consider running for president.
“It’s time for the women to take over Washington and fix the fracture in the government,” said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.
“After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president very seriously.”
Warren will intervene during the municipal meeting and will say that "Trump was leading the country in the wrong direction".
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Thursday, Warren will say: "It's clear that the FBI investigation before the election was a witch hunt."
A new poll shows that a majority of Warren’s supporters believe she won’t run in 2020.
A majority of 55 percent of likely Massachusetts voters said they would not vote for Senator Kerry if he were not on the ballot.
About 30 percent of the population supports the candidacy.
The poll will reveal a wider support for the candidacy of former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other Democratic candidates who are likely to be considered for the 2020 nomination include Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden will say he will reveal his decision officially to the president, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites the affected by TEPT Track Palin at the Trump meeting
Track Palin (26) will spend a year in Iraq after enlisting in the Army on September 11, 2007
On Monday night, police arrested a man and charged him with domestic violence.
“With the one who is passing away, I can understand other families who are going through the ramifications of TEPT and some of the emotional scars that return when our soldiers return,” he will explain to the public at a meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin will name the elephant "the elephant in the room" and will say the following to her son and other veterans of war: "Make it a little different, make it a little tougher, make it a little more respectful of the sacrifices that your fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the military, have made for this country."
The van will be stopped Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and the driver will be charged with domestic violence and weapons possession, according to Dan Bennett, the police chief of Wasilla.
18 states and the District of Columbia have pledged support for a new policy on asylum
The District of Columbia and the State of Columbia have joined the legal challenge to a new policy of the United States that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia will file an amicus brief on Friday in support of a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border.
The full name of the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal government on behalf of Grace vs Sessions is expected to be revealed in August.
He said that the band members and the band’s fans were going to attack her, but the U.S. officials are going to deny her request for asylum on July 20.
The van will be stopping in Texas.
The advocates for the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there is a great number of applicants for asylum in the United States, as countries that face general problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new policy of the US government revokes a decision of 2014 by the Board of Appeals of Immigration that allowed undocumented immigrants to seek asylum from domestic violence.
The District of Columbia’s top prosecutor, Karl Racine, is expected to announce Thursday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
The federal laws require that asylum claims be adjudicated according to the facts and circumstances of the case, and this prohibition violates the principle of non-refoulement.
The advocates also argue that the policy that denies entry to immigrants is bad for the economy of the United States, since it is more likely that it will cause entrepreneurs to leave and "create jobs that are needed".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions will order immigration judges to deny asylum to domestic violence victims and members of gangs.
“The asylum is available for those who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
The asylum has the pretentious goal of solving all problems, not just the most serious ones, but also those that people face every day.
Efforts to rescue survivors in Palu are being hampered by the sheer number of people who have been lost.
For the survivors, the situation is getting more desperate by the minute.
“The environment is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, 35, as she calmly watched her son with a fever in a hospital in the city of Palu that had been destroyed by the earthquake.
Every minute, an ambulance carries someone.
There is no potable water.
People have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to salvage what they can.
There are hundreds of thousands of people, and the hospitals, are full of sick people.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his leg, have been discharged from the military hospital in Palu, as the patients are being discharged because of the strong aftershocks that are continuing.
The police said the man had been shot in the head and chest, and that the woman had been shot in the head and chest.
“There was no time to save us.”
He was trapped in the ruins of the house, grew", he told the Associated Press, and added that his family had witnessed a wedding in the village.
“I felt my wife crying and asking for help, but I didn’t feel her again.”
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well.
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses the Chinese government of "propaganda announcements".
One week later, a Chinese government publication published a full-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the advantages of doing business between the United States and China.
President Donald Trump is scheduled to address the Des Moines Register on Wednesday, the newspaper with the most circulation in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the November U.S. elections, which China denies.
The accusation by Trump that Beijing was interfering in the US elections will mark a new phase in the US campaign to intensify pressure on China.
It is normal for the governments of foreign countries to insert advertisements in the press to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and that has put pressure on the trade agreements between the two countries.
The tariffs imposed by the United States on Chinese goods are intended to punish the exporters of states, such as Iowa, that support the Republican Party of Donald Trump, according to experts in China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, said Beijing had harmed American farmers, ranchers and businesses.
China, Branstad is going to write an article for The Des Moines Register about the propaganda ads in our free press.
In order to promote his propaganda, the governor uses the respected tradition of free speech and the press in the United States to insert an advertisement for payment in The Des Moines Register.
In China, where I have been for the past two weeks, I have seen very few signs of the differences that are often talked about in the West. The Chinese people I have met are not concerned about the trajectory of the Chinese economy, as long as the Party is in power.
One of the most prominent scientists in China declined to publish the article, but he did not name the publication.
The Republicans were the voters of women before the midterm elections with the disaster of Kavanaugh, warn the analysts
With many of the leading Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that the response will be negative, especially among women, who are expected to turn out in greater numbers in the midterm elections.
The emotions that surround this case are extremely high and most Republicans have already shown that they want to move forward with a vote.
These things can’t be explained," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, who is writing an article that will be published Saturday.
Reeher will say that he doubts that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to allow the FBI to complete its investigation will be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened today, nor will they forget what happens tomorrow,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the principal adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday, the Protestants cry "November is coming!" (November is coming!) while the Republicans are in the Senate while the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decide to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of the Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be missing from the graphic, explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“The people say that they have been here before; it’s true.”
But there could have been more, especially among voters in the suburbs and younger voters, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.
Before the public testimony of Ford, she had detailed her allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh to the FBI. Analysts suggested that the Republicans could produce a negative response if they pressed her.
“This is a political embolism for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the Senate or the final vote. It’s also about how the Republicans have managed this issue and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, the executive director of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC that helps elect Democrats.
However, the North Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford effect and those who believe in the Kavanaugh effect, with the balance of power tilting toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony is “indisputable” or “probably true,” while 35 percent believe Kavanaugh’s testimony is “indisputable” or “probably true.”
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had lied under oath, while 30 percent said they believed Ford.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the requests for intervention by Ford and, at a minimum, another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week under oath that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when they were both 17 years old.
Ramirez says the candidate for the Supreme Court will show his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the open source platform of code of Tim Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to sort through their data and share it with certain people.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that the hidden agenda of Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
“We have to do it,” says the emerging company.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid platform to allow users to create their own "personal data space" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional information.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They’re all available in a browser right now.
The fact that the data is stored in a personal data file is that the user decides who can access the information.
The company calls it "empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company’s European director, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills to make the platform Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a platform for security acquired by IBM, some contract developers working on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, developers from all over the world will be able to create their own applications using the decentralized infrastructure available at the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee will say that none of his team is talking about "Facebook and Google" about whether to introduce a "radical change" to all business models "during the night."
“We are not permitted to be here.”
Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee will transform the Internet when he founds the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The last two months, Berners-Lee has been a prominent voice in the debate over the neutrality of the Internet.
During the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“Incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee will say.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Church of the Holy Cross of the First World War
The only cleric of the Church of England to be awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War was posthumously honoured by his home town 100 years later.
The colonel and reverent Bernard Vann obtained the medal for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
Despite this, he will be awarded the Victoria Cross four days later and will not know that he had just won the highest military honor in Britain.
The two men will unveil a commemorative plaque on Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the astronauts, Michael Vann, will say that it was "magnificent" that the lens was presented exactly 100 years after the first flight of the Wright Brothers.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann was to lead his battalion through a thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery.
The runner will be running at full speed and, with the "maximum effort", will push the line ahead of him before launching himself over the hurdle with one leg and leaving three members of the team behind.
The colonel will be shot by a German machine gun on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) will say that the actions of his son and the rest of the crew are a feat that can never be equaled, which produces a feeling of humility.
The father and son, Dr. James Vann and James Vann Jr., will also be handing out a crown to the winner of the parade, directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann will say that he was honored to be part of the parade and will add that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by his willingness to support many people.
The MMA fans who are going to stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 will be able to see Peppa Pig in their own language
Imagine you stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and that you missed the most important event.
The sign of San Jose contained 13 lights, including six of the main target and had to be seen live all night on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing for their fight, the spectators of the United Kingdom will be left stunned when the programming changes to Peppa Pig.
Some people are disgusted by having to stay awake all night to see the fight.
A Twitter follower will describe the change in the drawings as "a man vomiting up a mouse".
The government regulations say that the 6:00 a.m. program is not appropriate, so they are going to change the programing to the children’s channel.
“Peppa the pig, yes.”
The president of the Bellator MMA, Scott Coker, will say that they will work to include the audience from the United Kingdom in the future.
“When I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
But we can’t get up until the morning of the next day, and we can’t get up until the morning of the next day.
But we are working on it.
I was wondering if you could tell me what happened when I changed channels. There were a lot of messages that came in and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to resolve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government problem.
I promise you that I won't do it again.
They will leave five lights on, instead of six normally. They will try to show it to the audience, but it will end.
It’s a bad situation.”
Tom Daley felt "inferior" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he has felt inferior to the rest of the world because of his sexual orientation, but that it will provide the motivation to win.
The 24-year-old athlete has declared that he will not stop until he has graduated from secondary school, which no one else has done.
On the BBC Radio 4 program Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne was talking about the rights of gays to marry, saying that it gives hope to other people.
He also said that the Olympics had regained importance.
The regular presenter of the long-running BBC radio show, Kirsty Young, has been off air for several months due to illness.
Daley, who will appear on the first episode of Laverne & Shirley, will say that he felt "less than" the other characters because "it wasn't acceptable socially for boys and girls to be together".
He said, "Today, these feelings of inferiority and difference have become real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph."
He wanted to prove that there was "something" there, you know, so he wouldn't have to admit that he was gay.
The two-time bronze medalist in the 2012 Olympics has become a prominent promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without having to hide his sexuality and wanted to give hope to others.
The triathlon of the world will explain how Lance Armstrong fell in love with a man, the American director Dustin Lance Black, who will meet him in 2013, "and will grab him by surprise".
Last year, Daley will marry the Oscar-winning actress, 20 years his senior, but he says that the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you are young, you can experience a wide range of emotions, from joy to sadness, and it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced the same things.
The couple will be married in June of this year, according to Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "his whole perspective" has changed.
“If I had asked you last year, you would have said that all you needed was to win an Olympic gold medal,” he said.
There are things more important than the Olympic medals.
My gold medal from the Olympics is named Robbie.
His son is saying that his father, Robert, who is going to die in 2011, at the age of 40, of a brain tumor.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked for was if he had the tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘no, you won’t be sitting in the first row,’ he said.
“While he was holding her, she stopped breathing and she was dead, that’s why I finally accepted that she was not invincible.”
The following year, Daley will compete in the 2012 Olympics and will win the bronze.
“I knew that was what I had been doing all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in the Olympics. There was no better feeling,” he will say.
It will also inspire the trio’s first song (Proud of Heather Small), which had accompanied the preparations for the Olympics and which still gives her goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A Mickelson will be playing in the Ryder Cup this Saturday
Phil Mickelson will try to break a record by playing in his 47th Ryder Cup match on Thursday, but he will have to change his physical state if he wants to avoid being a "lucky loser."
Mickelson, who will be playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, will be paired with Jim Furyk for the “fourballs” and “foursomes” on Saturday.
In place of being the center of the action, as has been the case in the United States, the referee for the five major championships will divide his time between officiating and working on his game at the club, with the hope of correcting what he does wrong.
He has not made the drivers more direct, nor has he been as solid at the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the rough punishes the wayward shots.
If Mickelson’s own trajectory is not particularly exciting, he will face the precise course of the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points ahead at the start of the 12 individual matches, start strongly, Mickelson’s match could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk is expressing confidence in this course, without being able to say much more.
“I’m going to hit a perfect shot, I’m going to hit a nice little bump and roll it up to the hole and I’m going to be ready to go,” Furyk said.
You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
It is a famous room and has contributed much to these devices and this week.
I probably wouldn’t have imagined playing two games.
I have imagined more, but I have also imagined that we are training and that we are advancing.
It will be like any other.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break the record of Nick Faldo for the most Ryder Cup matches played.
It could mean the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has not been equaled.
Mickelson has won 18 tournaments, 20 defeats and seven ties, all of which Furyk has said has added intangible benefits to the team.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, humorous, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion for the crew,” he explained.
“I think the younger players are enjoying this week, too, which is fun to see.”
It adds a lot more to the game.”
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can be exploited
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Ryder Cup will begin in 1997 at Valderrama, when Seve Ballesteros’s team had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they won by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
“We had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, but we lost at Valderrama, but we won at Valderrama, but we lost, but we won,” he said, after the image, after seeing the victory of the team of 2018 by 5-3 on Thursday and 10-6 on Friday, which leaves the score at Le Golf National.
The history has taught me and all the members of the crew that it is not yet over.
Now we have to go all the way.
You have to get out and do it.
This doesn't end until the points can't be marked.
We have a goal, to win the trophy, and we have to keep our concentration to do it.
I have already said this, in the center of the 12 players that we have, but also I have present who are our rivals: the best players in the world.
Impressed with the quality of his players’ performance on the golf course, Bjorn has said: “I won’t rush into it.”
Tomorrow will be different.
Today the individual performance will make the difference and will change everything.
It is fantastic to be with a company when you play golf, but the duels put your skills to the test to the maximum.
This is the message you must send to the players, try to get the best of them tomorrow.
At this moment, leave your company and he will also leave and find the best of himself.
In contrast to Bjorn, the captain’s rival, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will add three points.
Furyk knows all about the last day’s rallies, since he will be part of the Ryder Cup team before he finishes losing in the “Miracle at Medinah” that will win Europe.
“I remember every word,” said Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, after the last day.
“We have 12 important matches today, but we want to start with a good one, like the one we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, there is a lot of pressure on these central defenders.
We have prepared the alignment in accordance with the circumstances and the best way to make magic happen.
Thomas has the reptile instinct to try to start a comeback against Rory McIlroy in the first match of the day, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the European team in the first match of the day.
“I tried this order because I believe it covers all the possibilities,” said Bjorn on his selection for the individual events.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German frigate will be completed in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War era, but it will not be ready until the end of the year at the earliest, according to local sources.
The finalization of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the main ship of the new class Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed until the first quarter of 2019, according to the German newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military port official.
The ship will be launched in 2014, but the problems that have plagued the construction have caused the project to be delayed.
The four Baden-Württemberg class frigates that the German Navy will replace in 2007 will be the old Bremen class frigates.
It is believed that it will include a potent cannon, a combination of missiles and anti-missiles, as well as technology to detect and defeat stealth attacks, such as radar reduction, infrared sensors and acoustic signatures.
Other characteristics include longer periods of maintenance: it may be possible to use the new parts for two years without passing through customs.
However, these delays continue to imply that the vanguard aircraft, which is expected to be able to project power to Germany as a forceful power, will be obsolete before they are even in operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 is already news of the past, when the German Navy will return the ship to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a vessel to the builder without a scratch.
Few details of the motion of the craft have been released, but the German media have cited various "material and technical defects" of the vehicle that would make it unusable in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, since approximately 120 mariners, the majority of the crew needed for the old frigates of class Bremen, or operate in vessels of class Baden-Württemberg.
In addition, the weight of the ship is also excessive, which means that it will be able to carry less and limit its ability to carry future improvements.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", weighing 7,000 tons, will be twice as heavy as the German ships used during World War II.
The problem with the defective materials, the cost of the project, which also includes the training of the crew, is beginning to show a problem.
It is believed that the company has raised $3.1 billion (3.6 billion dollars) from an initial $2.2 billion (2.6 billion dollars) press release.
The new frigates have become a major issue, if you consider the recent warnings that indicate that Germany’s military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament’s defense committee, has acknowledged that the German navy is “without vessels that can be used.”
The official said the situation has worsened because they will no longer be able to use the old aircraft, but they will not be able to provide any new ones.
He lamented that the Baden-Württemberg class cannot join the Navy.
The National Spying Foundation spies on the secret lives of rats
A new study at a farm in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to discover how the red squirrels use the landscape to feed themselves.
The new discoveries are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation efforts.
The study of the scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland will continue to focus on the more common and less rare, as well as the more northern and aquatic species in the Jardí Botànic d'Inverewe, located in Wester Ross.
They will be placing special recording devices in key locations on the property to monitor the activities of the rats during the season.
Volunteers and staff of the National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by experts will determine the frequency of the sounds made by the rats and what each species does.
With this information, we will be able to create a map and a report of the habitat to create a detailed image of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation officer for the Scottish Wildlife Trust, expects the results to show which habitats are most important for the species and how they use each one.
This information will help determine the advantages of the management of the habitat, such as the creation of parks, and improving the maintenance of the forests for the benefit of other species and other associated species.
The population of rats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration of buildings threaten the bats, as they can cause the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and solar panels also pose a risk, just like the paper wasps and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In reality, the rats are not sleeping.
In addition, owls are more nocturnal than other birds, so they are more likely to be active at night when they are hunting for prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of localization to locate insects and obstacles that might interfere with their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taking the situation very seriously.
The experts have the proper training to conduct inspections, sonar surveys, and, on occasion, rescues.
The organization has created the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to the red squirrel, which is the only native land mammal in the country.
The farm administrator, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Threave, we have a great area for the rats,” he says.
We have ancient buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still have a lot to learn about the rats, and other properties will help us to understand better what they need to survive.
It is important to verify if there have been any ratpenats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as it is possible that the possible destruction of a newborn star could kill more than 400 females and young people, which could mean the extinction of an entire local population.
The rats are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, molest or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish conservation officer, has urged the public to go a step further to help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about the rats and, in the case of some of our species, we have no data on their population."
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the accusations of rape against him are "false news" and has said that people "want to be famous" thanks to his name.
The lawyers will demand that the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the accusations, retract them.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping a woman from the United States, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room of a hotel in Las Vegas in the year 2009.
Presumably, you will pay $375,000 for the incident not to be made public, as the information published on Thursday by Der Spiegel.
In a video on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, will say that the allegations were "false news".
No, no, no, no, no.
The one who said that today, false news”, said the fifth time gold medalist to the camera.
“I must have been famous in my time.”
It is normal.
I want to use my name to become famous, but that is part of my job.
A happy man and everything is in order,” he added, “I’m sleeping.
The lawyers of Ronaldo are preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have qualified as "unacceptable information about private life", in agreement with Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said the player is seeking compensation for "moral damages" equivalent to the gravity of the offense, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident is expected to take place in June 2009 at the suite of the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the hotel room of the player, where, presumably, Ronaldo raped Mayorga anally, according to the reports filed with the Clark County District Attorney’s office.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo is going to be fined after the incident and will tell him that it was a "99% good thing", except for a "1%".
The documents suggest that Ronaldo will confirm that the two had sexual relations, but they were consensual.
Mayorga also says she will go to the police and have her injuries photographed at the hospital, but she will accept a settlement outside the courts because she "didn't want to be humiliated publicly."
The woman, 34 years old, says she wants to annul the agreement, since she is still traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United in the summer, but he has now signed for Juventus, the Italian giants, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will "always" lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom will always be a great power, if it loses its status as the world’s leading manufacturer after the Brexit, according to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
He added that it was "disconcerting" that Toyota had told the BBC that, if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would have to temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory in Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Auris and Avensis models for Toyota, will produce 150,000 cars this year, of which 90 percent will be exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal, it will be a disaster for our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, director of operations at Toyota Burnaston.
The exit of the EU without an agreement on how to trade with the rest of the EU has awakened the interest of other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after the Brexit vote.
The main concerns are related to the fact that the manufacturers consider risks in the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyota production line is real, with fish arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, it is possible that there could be delays at the border, which the sector considers could cause disruptions and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the plant in Derbyshire, according to the company, and production would have to be shut down as a result.
Clark says that Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “calibrated precisely to avoid those border controls”.
“We have to reach an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that allows us to enjoy the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said.
“The Toyota study is not the only one to show that the ability to continue with a single-cable system is essential for the future of the industry.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long the plant will be shut down, but it has said that the costs will be reduced and that the plant could lose competitiveness.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the plant for 24 years and is the union coordinator there, said the workers were very worried: "From experience, if they lose these jobs, they won't get them back."
A government spokesman has said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could end up "reopening" the Russia investigation.
The expected meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be delayed a week while the fight over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court continues at the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, the connections between Russia and the Trump campaign, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump fires or does not fire the special prosecutor, he has fed the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein is discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But the rumors that he was about to resign were rampant on Monday.
He also announced that he will be meeting with Trump, who was in New York at the time.
Trump has said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but he is postponing the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Kavanaugh and one of the women who is going to accuse him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump is going to order the FBI to investigate the Kavanaugh allegations for a week, which will end up delaying the vote in the Senate.
The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, will appear on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he will respond as follows: "We haven't set a date yet, but it could be this week, or it could be another week or two for all the assumptions."
But we can see it now. I always like to keep up with the news.
Some journalists could refute this assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace will ask why.
Sanders will respond that the lack of press conferences was not because he did not like the "bluster" of the press, but that he will say, "I will not deny that we are fanfarers."
Then, it is suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president has more sessions of questions and answers than the previous president,” he said, before adding, without citing any sources: “We have consulted these data.”
Sanders said the press briefings would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me."
We have tried to do this in the past, but we have not been able to do it until now. We will replace the informational sessions with a conversation with the President of the United States.
Trump responds to questions when he is at the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on official visits.
The press releases from individual companies are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, in some moments, he seems to be estranged from the press.
The Secretary of Health for Scotland wrote to the workers of the Scottish National Health Service about the fears of the Brexit.
The Secretary of Health for Scotland has written to the staff of the European Union working in Scotland to express gratitude for their work and to say that Scotland will continue to work with the EU after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, member of the Scottish Parliament, will send a letter to the UK government within six months of the UK leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has already promised to cover the cost of applications for residency for EU citizens working in public services.
On his map, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and it seems likely that a decision will be reached this late.
However, the British government has also begun preparations in case of a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that these are convulsive times for all of you.
I would like to reiterate that I appreciate the contributions of all members of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The companies of the EU, and more so, contribute a valuable experience and resources that will strengthen and improve the service of the health care system, while benefiting patients and communities.
By the way, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers’ starting quarterback, was taken to the hospital after suffering a head injury in the team’s 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt on Saturday, according to Mike Organ, of the Tennessean.
The Tennessee State University coach, Rod Reed, has told the press that the injury will be ready for the middle of the season.
“He’s going to come to the line and he’s going to fall over,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff will give oxygen to Abercrombie before placing him in a litter and waiting for him to recover enough to be moved.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from the hospital.
Harris has added that "we still don't have information about the type or the amount of the damage" and Tennessee State is investigating how much damage the injury will produce.
It is the first season of Abercrombie, of course, after having been founded in Illinois.
The team had completed five games before losing their sixth on Saturday, a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK under the Conservative Party’s plans.
This will neutralize the exit of Corbyn for young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will be borne by those people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The company hopes to raise up to $120 million annually to help the homeless.
It is expected that the cost of stamps will rise for overseas buyers, and that these stamps will be used to help people without a home, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the exit of Jeremy Corbyn by attracting younger voters with promises of providing more affordable housing.
The increase in the tax rate will be paid by those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; these dinners will be used to combat tax evasion by the government.
The overcharge, which will be added to the postage rate in the next few years, will include the highest levels introduced two years ago in second-class residences and speculation in real estate, which could be as high as 3%.
The company expects to earn $120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new construction in London is owned by non-British residents, which means that the prices are rising and it is becoming more difficult for new buyers to get into the market.
Many areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" with the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure will come into effect next week, after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp duty for first-time buyers to help them get on the property ladder.
He will accuse the big construction companies of keeping the prices of the properties high and not using them, and he will ask May to annul the quotes for affordable prices so as to correct the "immobilier disaster" in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including controls on the rental market and the finalization of the “without-culpability” procedure.
We will also give more power to the municipalities to build new buildings.
He said, "Last year I said that I would devote my term to restoring the British sleep: life must get better for the next generation."
I want to correct the shortfall in our real estate market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to all who wish to live, work and create a life here.
It is not correct that it is easier for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for businesses with their headquarters abroad, to buy property in comparison with British residents who work.
For many people, the dream of owning a house is still far away and the indignity of not having a house yet is even more real.
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to coach Scotland"
The Sunderland manager, Jack Ross, has said his "maximum ambition" is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot has accepted the job of manager of the north-east club, which currently occupies third place in the League One, three points behind the leader.
You will arrive at the Stadium of Light this summer after the St Mirren were promoted to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.”
He said: "I'm going to have to call on my support and that's going to be a big help."
“But I grew up playing a lot of football at Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it’s always a thing that takes me back in time.”
This opportunity will only come if I have the time to train at clubs, but I don’t.
The predecessors of Ross in the coaching of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The manager of the Alloa Athletic says he is not feeling the pressure of being the next in a list of names consecrated in a team as big as this, after having turned down previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, my criterion for measuring my success will be whether I can get this team back to the Premier League.”
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its location is the Premier League.
“It’s not easy to get here, but I only considered coming here if I could get back.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as technical director at Hearts.
It will help the Alloa avoid relegation and transform the St Mirren into a championship-winning team for the season after.
Ross says he feels more comfortable in the United States than he did during his playing days in Scotland, with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“This is a decisive moment,” he said about accepting the offer to become the All Blacks coach.
“We always thought that training was the best way to get better, but playing is better.”
I was able to get some sleep, and I was able to enjoy some good moments during the night.
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you have to overcome each week.
I still feel the stress and pressure of the job, but I feel good about what I do.
I have always wanted to train and I have been doing it for a long time, but it is only now that I feel comfortable doing it.

The perfect time to have a pint is 5:30 on a Saturday, according to a study.
The heat wave has hit bars in the UK, but it has also put more pressure on restaurants.
The bars and restaurants have seen a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but the consumption in restaurants has fallen by 4.8%, according to the statistics.
Peter Martin, of the financial advisory CGA, said the following: "The extra hours of sunlight and the participation of England in the World Cup, which has extended more than expected, have meant that July has followed a pattern similar to that of June, with a 2.8% increase in bars, except for restaurants, which have suffered more.
The reduction of 1.8% in restaurant consumption in June has been felt in July.
The bars and taverns, which are the main consumers of beer, have obtained the best results, while the restaurants have had a low consumption.
Restaurants that offer meals have also suffered, but not as dramatically as restaurants.
It seems that the people only wanted to get out.
The bars and taverns that we have consulted, the sales of castles have increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sales of food have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of the hotel and restaurant analysts at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April."
The impact of large social or sporting events and the continuing influence of the world’s largest sporting event are the main factors driving the growth of the market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to have problems, but a 4.8% decline in sales would be particularly damaging, more than the continuing pressure on costs.
This summer has been so long and hot that it could not have arrived at a better time for the markets that serve food and the weather will tell us if the temperatures will be more moderate than we have had in August.
The total sales of bars and restaurants, including the new ones, have increased by 2.7% in July, which indicates the increase in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the restaurant, bar and tavern sector in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data from 47 operators, with a combined turnover of more than £9 million and is the reference point for the sector.
One in every five children has secret social networks that threaten the pairs
One in every five children, some as young as 11, have secret accounts on social networks that threaten their peers and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has indicated an increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has created fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of the students say they have a "main" account that they show to their peers.
One in every five children, some as young as 11, believe that social networks are a threat to adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has indicated a rapid increase in the number of false accounts on Instagram, a reference to the photo-sharing app.
The news has created fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of the students say they have a "main" account that shows their friends, while also having a "private" account.
A woman who discovers the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter will see a message from another girl who is asking "Please, help me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Heads’ Committee of Independent Schools (HMC), revealed that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, of which 80 percent have admitted to having private accounts.
The captain of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, has said the following: "It is very worrying that many teenagers are tempted to create spaces in cyberspace with their peers and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "face of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been named the new executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation at the annual general meeting.
Doyle is the athlete of the track and field and the president of Scotland Ian Beattie will describe the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his international experience in the last decade.
“The Eilidh has the respect of the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world and we are sure that the athletics of Scotland will benefit from her appointment to the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle has said the following: "I have many ambitions to act as a role model for the athletes and I hope to be able to help Scotland in the Olympics."
The United States, which won $1.5 billion in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, will be without its most decorated athlete, who won four gold medals and is now a commentator for the BBC, after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
I just wrote this on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago."
He couldn't walk.
The doctors say that only time will tell if I can recover or not.
I was exhausted, but I recovered, and now I can walk and do agility exercises!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!
A billboard ad comparing the oceans to cows has divided opinion on the Internet
A company of milk-tire-tossers has divided the opinion of the Internet with an ad that compares the milk-filled tires to cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent shot that can be carried out from the moon," the consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a music video for a joke about the freedom that the new moon shot gives the oceans.
Four real mares are in a large barn, eating hay and drinking water at the rhythm of a song that includes the lyrics: "Yes, I love my mare, but I won't see her again." and "If you haven't given her a name, she's not yours, she's just a mare."
The tornado continues: "Boom, boom, feed the fish, boom, boom, drown the flies."
The announcement, posted on the Facebook page of the company, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has broken a barrier of reactions from those who have seen it, with many saying it shows the horrors of the meat industry.
“It is a bad decision to use cows to advertise a product.”
We are embarrassed and ashamed to have to produce milk, and we are separated from our children for a few days after giving birth. One person wrote, "I am embarrassed and ashamed to have to produce milk, and I am separated from my children for a few days after giving birth."
The Elvie is discreetly hidden in a lactation support (Elvie/Mother)
Another person is going to comment on this: "Completely understandable after the accident and the drowning."
But why not use them to announce a sale on fish that would still have their fins?
Another user will add: "It's an ad out of place."
Other people are defending the announcement; one woman admits that she found the song "entertaining."
I think that’s a great idea.
In purchasing a bottle of milk, you have already given up breastfeeding.
To blow up the balloon feels exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit of a joke, but it is true.
It’s a great product,” writes a user.
Another person will comment on the following: "It's a funny ad aimed at people who are bored at work or at the bathroom and feel like they're cows.
It is not a commercial announcement that the dairy industry is in trouble.
At the end of the video, the dancers show that they have been dancing all along with the ball hidden in their hands.
The concept that is being promoted is based on the perception that many people feel like they are cows when they use the toilet.
The Elvie is completely silent, it has no cable or tube and fits discreetly in a lactation support, giving women more freedom and mobility during the day, even while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, co-founder and developer of Mother, has said: "The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that it deserves a campaign that is bold and provocative."
In tracing the parallels between dreams and waking states, we wanted to show how the tirallet and the reptes work, and how they can be used to demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that the new tirallet offers.
This is not the first time Elvie has been featured in the news.
During London Fashion Week, two boys are going to appear on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Thousands of children, silently transported to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children crossing the border illegally has increased even though the monthly entries through the border have remained stable, in part because of the tough rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration.
Traditionally, most sponsors were immigrants who had to prove their ability to support the child if they wanted to stay in the country if they decided to adopt a child.
The risk has increased in June, when the federal authorities are expected to announce that the possible sponsors and the rest of the adults who have adopted children will be able to send digital files, which will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, will testify before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have sought to bring unaccompanied minors into the country.
The agency will confirm later that 70 percent of the arrests had no criminal records.
“About 80 percent of the people who have come to the United States illegally are from Mexico, and a great majority of them are criminals.”
For this reason, the police will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
To process the children more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that require that some have to present themselves at the border within a month after being reported missing, instead of 60 days, which was the standard previously.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, in lieu of physically present, to defend their case before a judge of immigration.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
With more time in foster care, the likelihood is that they will experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to run away, according to the workers and reports that have been provided in the last few months.
The advocates say that these concerns can intensify in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of its size, it will pass through all the signs that indicate that a child is suffering.
They have added that transferring children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends can cause them trauma that they will have to deal with for many years.
Syria is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw their forces.
Directing himself to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Muallem, will ask the refugees to return home, despite the war in the country that has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as vice prime minister, has said that foreign forces are operating illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will deal with it accordingly".
“They must be removed immediately and without conditions,” he said.
Secretary of State John Kerry has insisted that the "war on terror" is essentially over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of refugees.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged all of Syrian territory of all terrorist groups and foreign interference."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise the Kurdish and Arab forces that are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 war cemeteries on its soil.
On the assumption of the refugees, Muallem said the conditions were good for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for "irrational" policies that force them to remain in the camps.
“We have been calling on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are trying to make an assumption that would be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement.
The diplomats of the United Nations have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in Idlib province, the last rebel bastion, has favored the opportunity to continue with political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces with the help of Russia.
Taleb also noted that the agreement has “clear terms” and expressed the hope that the military action will help defeat the jihadists, who include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, which is affiliated with Al-Qaeda. “They will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, sent by the UN, is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee to draft a new constitution and to begin to shape a path to a post-war constitution and to prepare for elections.
Muallem will present the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, the task of which will be to review the "articles of the current constitution" and warn of possible interference.
Why Trump will win again
According to this logic, Trump would win the election in 2020 if, as many liberals probably expect, the Electoral College votes for him.
It would be, no doubt, the most dramatic ending in the history of the presidency.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
From 2014, the number of viewers in the prime time audience has more than doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has a 2.4 million audience in the prime time hours, from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has led the cable news ratings with an average of 3.5 million viewers in the prime time hours.
“The people have seen it coming,” says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president when a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.

Remember a trip to Boston in a taxi before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver will tell him to vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asks.
“I’ll tell you why I was crying,” Scovell said.
There is a point of entertainment in the chaos.
By contrast, the difference between the programs on television could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if the families of immigrants can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the privileged can afford.
All of this and more is discussed in the book “Fear: Trump in the White House” by Bob Woodward, who has been called “the most important reporter in Washington” by the Washington Post.

The dinners outside the House of Representatives are inundating the elections of the mid-term Congress to the House of Representatives more closely aligned
It is not surprising that there has been a flood of diners in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has forced two members to compete for the same seat.
This reassignment of the district of Pittsburgh to a Democratic representative, Conor Lamb, who will take the place of a Republican who resigned in the spring of last year.
The Republican incumbent, Keith Rothfus, is facing a Democratic challenger, Rick Saccone, who represents the 17th district, which is in conflict with the newly drawn 12th district.
The maps are going to be redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania rules that the district lines drawn by the Republican governor are unconstitutional in favor of the Democrats.
The race for the 17th district has triggered a financial war between the major financial backers of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Pennsylvania will be known as the "Lamb State" after the special election held in March to fill the 18th Congressional District seat.
The Republicans have occupied the White House for more than a decade and President Donald Trump will win the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States has imposed sanctions on the Salvadoran government for its support of the Contras, but will lift them
The diplomats will observe that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized the People’s Republic of China, with little response from Washington.
Trump will have a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and the hotel was owned by his associates until they were forced out of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department will decide to withdraw the diplomatic caps of the United States from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the department, said this month.
However, the United States will not be able to sanction El Salvador until 2017, when it will receive $140 million in aid from the United States, according to estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic growth.
The proposed sanctions, which include restrictions on financial aid and visa restrictions, would be harmful to the country and would increase the number of deaths by assassination and terrorism.
With the postponement of the internal meetings, officials from both countries will be able to postpone a meeting of high level focused on security and economic prosperity, continuing with a similar meeting held last year and which will see the United States moving forward to prevent illegal immigration to the United States.
But by September, officials of high rank in the administration will clarify that they want the meeting to go ahead, and that it will end with the Salvadoran government being sanctioned.
Vice President Mike Pence has been selected to lead the meeting, scheduled for October, as a signal of the importance the administration places on the issue, according to the diplomats.

A White House spokesman said Bolton will not comment on the details of the debate that will be held by the three officials, which will include two diplomats, to discuss internal deliberations.
An external analyst will corroborate the statements.
Study history
The proper explanation for this phenomenon could be the information from the special counsel Robert Mueller about possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which is supported by many public records.
As Mueller also investigates whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on the 2016 elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump could be held accountable by the organization, just as he is preparing to do before the voters, and, finally, before a jury of his peers.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or of any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions that have to be made by both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long this situation will last.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to make a coup against Hitler, only if the western bloc had resisted and had given support to the Czechs and Slovaks.
You will fail and you will lose the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that will follow.
The course of history fluctuates on points of inflexion like this and accelerates or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing various points of inflexion currently.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who oversees Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water since the day before yesterday when this newspaper will report that, in the near future, he will suggest secretly recording the president and will speculate that it was not appropriate for the car.
Rosenstein says the Times story is not accurate.
“If the new investigation the FBI has requested on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it confirms the allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, what will you do?
We will vote for a majority in the House of Representatives to make Trump responsible.
If these predictions are not fulfilled, democracy will begin to run out of steam.
But I think they won’t break, because I’ve already learned the language in Prague.
My mother was a young Slovakian deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that would occupy the house of the ambassador.

Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers beat the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians would put them in a good position to qualify for the group stage of the Europa League.
A knee injury to Graham Dorrans will prevent him from playing the first 20 minutes of the season until the Rangers can tie the game 2-2 against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to get big results.
“This is a good opportunity for us, because Vila-real is a good team,” said the player, who is 31 years old.
“We’re going to play the game and we’re going to try to get a good result and come out with a point.”
Perhaps we could have something more at the end, but generally, probably empathy will be the result.
They will be better in the first part, but they will be better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it is another big night in Europe.
We hope to stay in the game for the next three points, but it will be a difficult game because we need to win the last game, but I am sure that we will give our best and we will get a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The equipment is good and the noise is down, the training is good.
I hope they can give it all, leave it all on the field and get out of here.
Women lose their hearing before men because of the retirement age.
All participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke with their family about their wishes.
Most of the respondents to the survey said they had spoken to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent of the respondents say they have spoken to their children.
“People want to be cared for, but they don’t want to talk about it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Let's start here.
Talk to your parents and your brothers and sisters: you can’t prepare your family for the future if you don’t communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to decide on and complete the required assessments, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining your cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: he or she can also help you determine the best way to pay for these expenses.
Your options for financing your treatment over the long term may include a policy of long-term care insurance, a hybrid policy of life insurance and long-term care insurance, or a policy you purchase on your own with the resources you have.
Prepare your legal documents: measure the length of your battles.
To help you find a representative, you can call the 24-hour toll-free number on the back of your ID card. This representative can help you find a doctor and make sure your needs are met.
Consider also the possibility of contracting a notarial power of attorney for your financial affairs.
Select a person of trust to make financial decisions for you in case of incapacity.
Don’t worry about the small details: Imagine that your family member has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Be specific about these details in a written statement.
The finances are not the only factor that should be considered, but also with which doctors should be consulted, according to Martin.

The police have been called to a number of incidents involving a shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot in the leg by a shotgun while returning home after leaving the bar.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was found in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, where he had been shot in the abdomen and chest.
The officials have described the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 in the morning (British summer time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see her attacker.
His life is not in danger from the police, but they have made a call for witnesses.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the city of Palu in Indonesia on Thursday, according to authorities. They expect the death toll to rise.
As the communications are down, the units of assistance have been unable to obtain information from the regency of Donggala, a region closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the extreme western edge of the narrow coastal plain of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km along the north-west coast of the island of Celebes.
The region, a lower administrative division than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The mining of nickel is also important to the province, but is concentrated, primarily, in Morowali, on the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered numerous tsunamis in the last 100 years, in accordance with the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the western coast of Donggala, killing more people.
Indonesia is located at the center of the Pacific Ocean and is prone to earthquakes with certain frequency.
Following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: On December 26, a large earthquake off the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, will trigger a tsunami that will affect 14 countries and kill 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, most of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes will affect the western coast of Sumatra in the last week of March and the first week of April.
Millions of people will die on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake in the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people will die.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra will trigger a tsunami that will destroy dozens of villages and kill hundreds of people.
In 2016, a severe heat wave will affect the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and will cause destruction and panic, as the population will remember the devastation of the heat wave and the 2004 tsunami.
This time, no tsunami is expected, but more than 100 people will die because of the buildings that will collapse.
In 2018, there will be a series of large earthquakes in the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia that will kill more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The thermal will destroy thousands of buildings and leave thousands of tourists stranded temporarily.
The son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, will be arrested for domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a public report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance tries to trick the police to report a crime, they will stretch the phone line.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Detention Center, and is being held without bail on a $5000 bond, according to KTUU.
He will be tried in court on Saturday, when he will be asked "not guilty, with security" when he is asked how he is declaring.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could be in jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $25,000.
He is also accused of a Class B felony, which could result in a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of plagiarism.
In December 2017, Todd Palin will be accused of assaulting his father.
Sarah Palin, the mayor of Wasilla, will be charged with notifying the police of the presumed attack.
Currently, the case is before the court of veterans in Alaska.
In 2016, he will be charged with domestic violence, interference with the reporting of a domestic violence incident, and possession of a firearm while under the influence of alcohol.
His wife is going to say that she had slapped him across the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin will be criticized by veterans for associating the violent behavior of her son with a post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died since a landslide triggered by a volcanic eruption on the Indonesian island of Celebes on Thursday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake has caused a tsunami and has destroyed millions of dollars.
The electricity and communications systems will not function and we expect the number of deaths to increase over the next few days.
The eruption occurred on the coast of Central Celebes, in the north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
The social networks circulate videos of the impact.
Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered on the beach in the city of Palu to watch the tsunami arrive.
Federal fiscal authorities are seeking a death penalty for a suspect in the terrorist attack on New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York that killed eight people: a death penalty that has not been applied to the state since 1953.
The suspect, 30 years old, is believed to have used a Home Depot truck to carry out the attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing eight people and injuring 11 others.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must show that Saipov intended to kill the eight victims "intentionally" and that he intended to cause "serious" bodily harm, in accordance with the law of the state of New York.
Both crimes could carry a death sentence, according to the court document.
Two weeks after the attack, a grand jury in federal court will indict Saipov on 22 counts, including 11 counts of murder in the commission of a terrorist act, which federal prosecutors can use in cases of organized crime, in addition to a count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The IRS officials say the attack will require "significant planning and premeditation" and will describe the way Saipov acted as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
“The suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, has caused injuries, deaths and other losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to the complaint.”
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last execution in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg died of electrocution on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents from the court, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, will not show any signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police will explain that they will support the investigators who say they felt good about what they had done.
According to the complaint, Saipov will explain to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his cell phone.
The police also want to see ISIS flags in the room of the hospital where the man is being treated.
He has been found not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represented Saipov, will say that they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
“Consider that the decision to seek the death penalty, in lieu of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma for all those involved in these events,” Patton will say.
The defense team for Saipov had previously asked the prosecutors to not seek the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party in the UK Parliament says Nigel Farage will be asked to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage is promising to mobilize "the popular tropes" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the UKIP has said that politicians must "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of the members of the UK parliament suggested that he would lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone will tell the people of Birmingham that the UK would already be out of the EU if Nigel Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenge facing the Prime Minister at this hour as she seeks to reconcile the deeply divided ranks of her party has been highlighted by the Conservatives who have staged a second protest against the Brexit in London.
The prime minister is fighting to keep her promise to the Conservative party to deliver Brexit by the end of March 2019.
The airlines insist that they will reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative responses and pressure from the Euro-skeptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
The Lord Bone will tell the meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to implement the Chequers agreement.
The Lord Farage has suggested that he would have been made a member of the House of Lords and that he would have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If I had been asleep, I would have been out of here.
The member of parliament for Wellingborough will say: "I will defend Brexit, but we must honour the Chequers agreement."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he adds: "We will not fight world wars to be slaves."
We want to make our own laws for our own country.
The Lord Bone will dismiss the suggestions that the public has already canvassed the idea that the British people have voted for: "The idea that the British people have canvassed is completely false."
The conservative Andrea Jenkyns will also be present at the march and will say: "Only the prime minister can save us".
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular with our party and our activists, who are the people who support the party and advise us on how to run the country.
They abandoned the Chequers compromise and began to follow.
In a letter to Mrs. May, he will add: "The prime ministers maintain their feina when they maintain their promises."
The Lord Farage is going to say that the politicians of the meeting have to feel the pressure if they want to bring the decision taken in the referendum of 2016.
“This is a question of trust between us (the people) and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to scare people into voting to stay in the EU. We are here to tell them that we will not allow them to do that.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I will tell you what I think the political class will do. They will betray Brexit."
We are mobilizing the popular tropes of this country that will give us the victory over Brexit and we will not rest until we become a United Kingdom independent, autonomous and proud.
However, the party leaders will meet for two hours before the Birmingham meeting.
A small number of activists will wave banners against the conservatives after the launch of the group this week.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis is going to resign from the party because of the security problems that the party is facing.
These are the people who tell us that they can provide us with the systems and technology to allow us to have a free trade agreement with Canada plus more, with the border without friction, with free trade with Ireland, without borders.
It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a Brexit "soft" exit, it will have to be hard.
Warren has said she will consider running for president
The US Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said she would consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat will speak at an open meeting of the western part of the state.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican candidate for governor of Massachusetts, who was Trump’s running mate in the 2016 election.
There have been speculations about the possibility of removing Trump from office in 2020.
The event on Saturday night of the 36th annual Holyoke St. Patrick’s Day Parade will be the city’s 36th annual parade, which will be held in the open format that Trump will assume when he takes office.
A staff member asked if she had planned to run for president.
Warren will respond that it is time for Washington to repair the government that does not work, and that includes a woman in the cabinet.
A person arrested for the murder of three LSU students
The Baton Rouge Police Department will announce Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at the press conference at 11:00.
They will release a video of the shooting on Friday and ask for help in identifying the shooter.
At 20 years old, he will be shot and killed in the morning of Friday at the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims is going to break a record that, finally, will kill him,” said the police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday on the 247sports website.
Wayde is going to try to defend his friend and will run the Simpson.
Simpson will be questioned and admit he was at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and he shot Wayde Sims.

The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the title of the world after the orders of the team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas is going to be ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it will be clear that the orders from the Mercedes team have a big impact on the race.
From the pole position, Bottas will have a good start and almost exhausts Hamilton while defending his position at the first two turns and inviting Vettel to attack his position.
Vettel will enter the pits before Hamilton and leave him to run the rest of the race with the traffic behind him, which would have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes will have to stop at the pits and come out behind Vettel, but Hamilton will advance after the pit stop and take the inside line that will put him in position to take the outside line after the next corner.
Max Verstappen will start from the last row of the grid and finish in the first row of the race on his 21st birthday.
Next, he will continue in good position and will keep his tires for the rest of the race, passing Kimi Raikkonen and moving up to fourth position.
Finally, he will enter the boxes at number 44, but he will not be able to increase his pace for the next eight laps and Raikkonen will be in fourth position.
It is a difficult day, because Valtteri has done a fantastic job all week and will be a true gentleman when you tell him that you left him behind.
The crew has done a fantastic job keeping the ship on course.
His body language will be terrible
President Donald Trump is going to rip into Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting to insist that she not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a meeting in Virginia, the president is not going to talk directly about the testimony of Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he will comment that the testimony of the person who was scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee showed that the person was "sad, cruel and mendacious".
“One thing that could pass and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate right now, when you see anger, when you see pain, when you see cruelty and lying.”
When you read the emails and the filters and they say "No, I haven't been here."
I have not been there.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you filtering?
Heard your response... Do you want to filter the document?
No, no.
I didn't filter it.
Yes, I'll wait a minute.
You can filter... No, no you can filter that out." He imitated the senator.
Feinstein will review the letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and will release it in September, but Feinstein will deny that the leak came from her office.
“I did not doubt Dr. Ford’s testimony, I did not try to filter her history,” Feinstein will tell the committee, according to The Hill.
“I will ask for confidentiality and I will maintain confidentiality, as I have asked.”
But the President’s denial is not going to please the President, who is going to comment at the meeting on Saturday night: "I know what you’re saying. Your body language is terrible.
Maybe it won’t happen, but it will be the best language I’ve ever seen.
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct with three women, the president will suggest that the Democrats are using the allegations for their own political purposes.
They are determined to regain the power of the means necessary.
The President said, "I don't care about the cruelty, I don't care about who is suffering, I care about who is in power and who is in control."
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer will score two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars will be looking to repair the defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday when they host the Elite League champions on Saturday.
The Giants will have an advantage of two goals thanks to the goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie have been able to level the playing field, but Dwyer will restore the advantage to the Giants.
Francois Bouchard will equal the Dundee. After two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen, the victory was assured.
It was the third loss of the season for the home team under Adam Keefe, who won 2-1 over Belfast on Friday.
This will be the fourth game between the two teams and the Giants have won the first three.
The first goal will come from the left side of the field at 3:35, from a pass by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with the help of David Rutherford, Beauvillier will double his advantage.
During this initial period of agitation, Sullivan will move the equipment back to the house at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt scores the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer will guarantee the Giants an advantage in the first break when he scores the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local equipment will be reassembled and, once again, Bouchard will contribute to his team’s score with a goal at the 27:37 mark.
Nielsen and Charles Corcoran have joined forces to help Dundee gain an advantage for the first time in the second half of the game and guarantee the victory of their team with the fifth goal at the end of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are at home, in Milton Keynes, and have their next game on Friday.
A controller saved hundreds of passengers from a plane that was about to crash into a mountain.
A controller in Indonesia became a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more have disappeared after a large earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Thursday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas have been produced in the area and many people have been trapped in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his friends escaped to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the tremulous tower of control at the Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
The aircraft will be moved to its parking spot to ensure that the Batik 6321 flight, which was on the runway at the time, can take off safely.
After that, he came out of the tower of control of the airport when he thought he was sinking.
You will die later at the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, will say that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
We need to prepare a helicopter to fly from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, I lost my flight to Palu before the helicopter arrived.
That's a good point.
However, the authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach into the thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Buton is limited.
“We expect the number of deaths to increase because there are still many people under the rubble and we still haven’t been able to reach many of them,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster agency.
The survivors of the tsunami, with a height of six to seven meters, will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying supplies and relief workers.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, will explain to Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries a corpse."
The drinkable water is scarce.
All the minicats have been shot.
Jan Gelfand, director of the Red Cross in Indonesia, will explain to CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find."
That’s a tragedy, but it could get worse.
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, will arrive in Palu on Sunday and will tell the military forces: "We need you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
Are you ready? CNN will be reporting live from the White House.
Indonesia will suffer another major earthquake this year, and it is expected to kill more than 550 people.
Air Niugini has reported that a passenger has disappeared after the plane crash in Micronesia.
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean off the Micronesian island of Guam said that the plane had disappeared, but that the 47 passengers and the crew had been evacuated safely.
Air Niugini will say in a statement that, from Saturday afternoon, they have not been able to find a passenger.
The airline is working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find it.
The airline will not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local vessels will help rescue other passengers and the crew when the plane goes down in the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities will be able to confirm on Friday that people have been transferred to a hospital.
The airline will tell you that there were six passengers on board and that all are in good condition.
Even though the cause of the accident is not known, the sequence of events is known.
The FAA and the US Navy have both stated that the plane will not be able to land on the water because the runway will be too short.
Some witnesses think the plane is going to crash into the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes will explain that the plane was going very low.
“This is going to be extremely important,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes will say that the passengers were able to walk on the water to the life rafts until the plane sank.
He said that the flight attendants will be panicking and will start screaming, and that he will be shot in the head.
The US Navy will say that the sailors who were working on the ship were also helping in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport the injured people to shore before the ship sank.
The Aviation Safety Network reports that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG airlines, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night that is going to burn a woman alive
The prosecutor will conclude the case on Saturday in the review of a Mississippi judge who sentenced a man to death for burning a woman alive in 2014.
The Justice Department’s analyst Paul Rowlett will testify for hours as an expert witness in the analysis of intelligence.
The jury will hear testimony about the use of the cell phone records to build the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett will say that he will be able to show that Chambers was with Tellis the night he died, which contradicts earlier statements by Chambers.
When the data shows that the victim’s mobile phone was with Chambers at the time when he said he was with Michael Sanford, the police will talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford will deny and testify that he was not in the city on that day.
When the IRS agents ask if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck with Sanford that night, Sanford will say he lied, because his truck was in Nashville.
Another incoherence is that Tellis will claim that he knew Chambers for two months before he died.
The telephone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett will say that, shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis will delete the messages, tricks, and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
“He’s going to be taken out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense will begin its final arguments on Monday.
The judge will say that he expected the jury to reach a verdict on the same day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A trio of hip-hop artists complete the music of their messages with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
The High Breed, of Bristol, assures that hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political and social problems.
Let’s bring back the old school hip-hop.
Some artists, like The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A New York woman is suing a hotel for $1 million after she was refused a room because she was black.
A New York woman has filed a discrimination complaint against a hotel after she received a message from a guest complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies being racist and compare the demand to a "shakedown".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her consternation at seeing that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived to work for the first time in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON”, she wrote to her husband in a text message.
But, in order to send it to his wife, Maurice sends it to her twice.
After having a bad dream, a "discomforting" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman is going to ask the "discomforting" Mrs. Maurice if she had a bad dream, and if she did, she will ask her to leave.
The lady Maurice will pay the full amount for her day of work and, after that, she will send the Uber home.
Yes, Maurice claims that he should be compensated for the inconvenience and demands a compensation of, approximately, $350 per day for the work he has done for six months for a contract that he had not signed.
“I want to show them that they can’t do things like that,” he said on Friday, “It’s discrimination.”
The couple has responded to the allegations that they are racist by saying that they are the most reasonable, since they cannot trust her after what she has done.
My wife is going to send me something I don’t want to hear.
It is not racist.
No I am not a racist," said Joel Plasco, the captain, to the Post.
But, wouldn’t you leave your children in the care of someone who has been convicted of child abuse, even if it was an accident?
A baby?
The "v" sound is a voiced bilabial fricative, which is a consonant sound produced by forcing air through the lips and vibrating the vocal cords.
Plasco, who has compared the demand with an "extortion", will say that she has two months to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you chasing something like that?”
It is not a very nice attitude," the investor banker added.
The case is still not resolved and the public opinion has already condemned the plaintiff to the social networks and condemned his behavior and his logic.
The editors of Paddington are concerned that the readers will not identify with a talking bear, in agreement with a new letter.
The daughter of James Bond, Karen Jankel, who will be born shortly after the book is published, will say in relation to the letter: "It is difficult to place oneself in the place of someone for the first time before the book is published."
It is very gratifying, and we are very grateful to those who have contributed to the great escape of Paddington.
He will explain that his father, who had been working as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children’s book about a little bird, was optimistic about the future of the book. He will also say that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books will be "agreed", after his father’s death last year.
Paddington is a very important member of his family and he is very proud of him. He finally got the recognition he deserved.
He was a quiet man; he wasn’t a presumptuous one.
But, as Paddington was so real to him, it will be practically the same as when your father advises you to do something: you will be proud of yourself, even if it is not a good idea.
He considered it so.
All that was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized the worth of Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
When they land, they will be taken to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors will work to save their lives.
“I didn’t think I could do it, but I did,” said the woman’s mother.
I was having a nightmare about Nad and she told me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
I did it.
I told him: "Tashi, I love you so much."
I will be flying with you.
I'm going with you.
The medications that they have been taking to keep their heart beating have been consumed and are now leaving their system.
He had died before it was scheduled and so it went out.
Only a matter of time, I knew he was coming.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was in a situation surrounded by family and friends.
I have to keep my good form.
Finally, the lady Ednan-Laperouse, who is still grieving for the loss of her daughter, is boarding the plane with the rest of the passengers, distraught by the experience she has just been through.
“No one knew,” he said.
He had the cap on and the tears wouldn’t stop.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad the air-conditioning repairman.
The sensation that I needed from my love and my understanding.
I know that I want to go."
Women are targets for preventing suicides at a bridge
Two people who have lost loved ones are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been targeted by phone calls and messages with inspirational quotes and phone numbers to call for help.
The son of the lady Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
“I don’t want to feel like I’m not feeling anything, or like I’m feeling too much,” he said.
The lady Davis, 45 years old, with residence in Lydney, will say that her son was a promising young man with a contagious sense of humor.
Everyone knows the feeling of waking up in the middle of the night.
They always said that his dreams could light up any room.
He will abandon his work before he dies because he is in a "very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, would later find out that he had his own life.
Mrs. Davis will say: "I am constantly worried that there will be a collateral effect."
The lady Davis is going to create the targets because the people will know that there are people to whom they can turn, that they can talk to, and that they can always count on if they are in need.
Don’t be shy: you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies’s friend for many years, will lose Mark, her husband, shortly after the death of her husband.
“I’m not saying it was good or that I was depressed,” he said.
Two days before Christmas, you will notice a change in attitude.
The children will be able to open their presents on Christmas Day, but they will not look at the others or the gifts.
It is said that her death caused a great trauma for them, but that they have to work: "Open a wound in the family."
They are destroyed.
But we must continue and play.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins an investigation.
“I thought if we could get something like that (a study with a limited scope and a limited time), we could achieve a certain unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday. He also said that he feared that the committee would be destroyed by the related death of the party leaders.
Why didn’t the president want the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh and the Republicans?
His reticence to see you is understandable.
Only five weeks remain before the November 6 elections. If, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, they will be weakened at the time of trying to get the President to resign.
George W. Bush has been caught using the phone to trick the senators and pressure them to confirm Kavanaugh, who worked for the White House under Bush. He also knows Ashley, his wife, through Bush, who was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, now, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Even if the Senate does not confirm Kavanaugh, he could still be confirmed by a simple majority of 51 votes, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The name of desertors from North Korea "means" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un took power, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said that 1,127 people deserted last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
The senior Park will say that the strict controls on the border between North Korea and China and the increase in the cost of doing business for traffickers of people have been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Most desertors from the North are offered the nationality of South Korea.
North Korean officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through Xina, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Xina considers desertors to be illegal immigrants, in place of refugees, and sometimes they are forced to return.
The relations between the North and the South, which technically are still at war, have improved considerably in the last few months.
At the beginning of next month, the leaders of the two countries will meet in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on denuclearization.
This will happen after the historic June 12 meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they will agree to work toward a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, the minister of external affairs of North Korea, blamed the lack of progress on the sanctions of the United States.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first,” said the senator Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi said that Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical figure" and is not qualified to work at the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi will say that the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical figure" and that his temperament makes him unfit to work on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi will make these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was a ‘historical figure,’ as Pelosi said in relation to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.”
Kavanaugh, emotional, will deny the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes crying and sometimes speechless while talking about his family and his years at Yale.
He will also condemn explicitly the Democratic committee and will say that the accusations against him are a "grotesque and coordinated assassination attempt by a liberal establishment" because Hillary Clinton is going to lose the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi will say that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he could not work at the Supreme Court because he showed his prejudices against Democrats.
“I think that the Clinton campaign has been very effective in trying to disqualify him,” he said.
Pelosi is expected to show some reticence when asked if she would try to block the confirmation of Kavanaugh, if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats advise the House to impeach him.
This is what I can say: if I did not tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, I would not be capable of being on the Supreme Court, and I would not be capable of being on the court either.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi is going to add that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make regarding the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In his own words, he will avoid questions about whether he will overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not a moment for a person with a history of mental illness and with a history of mental illness to enter the courtroom and expect us to be impressed,” Pelosi said.
Women have to exercise their power.
It is a justifiable diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and no tears without weeping.
“We need to be reminded more often than every four years,” said Ms. Steinem, who is 45 years older.
“Do you think it will be common? And you?”
It will continue... "It will help a lot of women who were executives in some place that I will say that they also cried when they were angry, but that they developed a tactic that consisted of, when they were angry and started to cry, to tell the person they were talking to: "Maybe you think I am sad because I am crying.
I am angry.
After that, I continued.
It seems brilliant.
The tears are permitted as a release for rage in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of a dream is when I was working in an office with a majority of men. I was so angry that I was crying uncontrollably, and I was going to punch the woman who had always terrified me, the director of the company. I was going to punch her so hard that I would knock her down the stairs.
“I don’t want to see them crying,” he said.
They don’t know you’re furious.
Think that you are sad and they will be happy.
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when the senator Hart was discovered to be having an extramarital affair on the Monkey Business, and the senator’s wife, Mrs. Schroeder, was very frustrated, she thought that there was no reason to run for president, and she decided to run herself.
“It’s not a well-considered decision,” he said, “but I’m 30 years too late.”
“We already had other candidates for the job and the last thing we needed was another one.”
Someone will say "Blancaneu and the little ones"
With the campaign running late, she will have to work hard to raise the $2 million she needs to get back on the race.
It was a lost battle.
She discovers that some of her supporters, who donate $1,000 to her campaign, are only willing to donate $250 to him.
“Do you think I’m crazy?” he asked.
When she announced that she would not be running for president, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who have helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of recapturing diners and orienting voters, in place of delegates, and the rage, and sexism) that she will be without words.
“I could have had a nervous breakdown,” recalled Mrs. Schroeder, referring to the reaction of the press.
“I could have thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.”
I remember thinking: What will they put on my tombstone?
“Are you crying?”
The trade war between the US and China could benefit Beijing.
The initial salvos of the trade war between the U.S. and China will be deafening and, as long as the war doesn’t end quickly, a distance between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, will issue his first warning to China at the beginning of this year, when he imposes tariffs on the country’s main exports, including solar panels, aluminum and steel.
The most significant climb will occur this week, with products valued at $200 billion. These products will be subject to a 20 percent tariff.
Beijing has responded to the same way every time and has recently offered to buy $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has promised to replicate the U.S. and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be able to be surpassed in the near future.
It is important for Washington to show that it is willing to back up its demands, but to do so publicly before the Chinese would be a major mistake for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
All of this, and the experts say, if Beijing plays its cards right, the trade war with the U.S. could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision by Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would start a cascade in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the testimony of witnesses has suggested,” says Abigail Grace, an associate fellow at the Center for New American Security, a Washington-based think tank.
Syria is "prepared" to receive the refugees, according to the Minister of External Affairs
Syria says it is ready to receive the refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war that has lasted more than five years.
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem will say that the conditions in the country are improving.
“The situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists have destroyed to restore normalcy.
It is very complicated to return voluntarily to the country where they have fled because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their economic situation and their ability to support themselves.
The EU estimates that more than 550,000 Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also millions of people who come to the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Moualem will say that the regime is doing everything possible to rebuild the country devastated.
But I will not accept conditional aid or the aid of the countries that are financing the insurgency.
The European team has selected Paris as the site for the Ryder Cup.
The European team has won the Ryder Cup for the first time in 25 years, defeating the American team 16.5 to 11.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and will not host the Ryder Cup again until 1993.
The European team will try to regain the Ryder Cup when Thomas Bjorn’s team arrives at 14.5 points, the number needed to win the Ryder Cup.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who will play the majority of the tournament, will hit the tee shot on the par-3 16th hole, which will give him the victory.
The Italian golfer Francesco Molinari will shine in all his matches and will convert into one of the four players who have won 5-0-0 in the current format of the tournament since 1979.
Jordan Spieth will be paired with Denmark’s Thorbjorn Olesen, who qualified for the European team with a 5&4 victory over Spain’s Rafa Cabrera Bello.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, will lose 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter, of England, who could have played in his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, is going to become the major winner in the tournament with 25.5 points.
I can't help but cry, but I can't help it.
It has been a very hard year.
Thanks, Thomas, for trying to help me.
I am so happy to have won the cup.
The equipment is the most important... I am very happy to have been able to help.
Pass the torch to your compatriot John Ram, who will defeat the legend of the American Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles competition on Sunday.
“I am incredibly proud to have helped Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him,” said Rahm, who is 23 years old.
Woods will lose the four matches he had against France and has a record of 13-3-3 in the Ryder Cup.
One of the most amazing statistics about Jack Nicklaus is that he has won 14 major championships and only one of them was won after he turned 40.
The U.S. team will play the entire week to try to win the Ryder Cup, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who will play in the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup playoffs.
The captain of the North American team, Jim Furyk, will speak after the frustrating loss of his team: "I am proud of these players, they fought hard."
This morning we have had a moment to press the European soccer team.
We have been attacked.
Thomas took the barrette.
It is a great capacity.
His 12 players have played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I estimate that these 12 players and I are proud to have been the captain.
There is no barret.
They have beaten us."
Reduction of the red tide: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota

The proliferation of the red tide has spread approximately 200 miles from the northern tip of Pinellas County to the southern tip of Lee County.
There are some areas as close as 16 kilometers from the coast of Hillsborough County, but in most places, the situation is worse than it was last week.
The red tide has also been observed in the county of Pasco.
The concentrations of fine particles have been reported in the Tampa Bay area during the past week, with concentrations of fine particles at low levels along the coast of Pinellas County, concentrations of fine particles at high levels along the coast of Hillsborough County, concentrations of fine particles at low levels in Manatee County, concentrations of fine particles at high levels in Charlotte County, concentrations of fine particles at low levels at the coast or at a distance from the coast of Lee County, and concentrations of fine particles at low levels in Collier County.
Continuous respiratory irritations are being reported in the states of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
