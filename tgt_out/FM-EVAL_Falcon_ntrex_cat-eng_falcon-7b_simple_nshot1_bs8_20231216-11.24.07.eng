Members of the Galician Assembly are worried because "they are being identified as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly have expressed their consternation at the proposal to modify the title of the member for Welsh Parliament.
This controversy has arisen from the desire to change the name of the assembly hall.
The members of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure could become a source of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party has said that his party is worried about the fact that MWP is "linked to Twp or Pwp".
For the readers who don't follow the rules: In English, two p's means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of Plaid Cymru's Assembly group has commented that the party "hasn't got the best of hands" and has proposed various alternatives.
For his part, a conservative member of the group has said that his group is "open", but he will also comment that there is a big difference between the terms "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, we can say that the letter “w” in gal·lès is pronounced like the letter “u” in English from Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly charged with drafting the legal text to introduce the changes: "The final decision on the qualification of the members will be made by the assembly members themselves."
The law of 2017 of the government of Galicia gives the power to the Assembly of Galicia to change its name.
The month of June, the committee will publish the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with a wide support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to Parliament of Galicia.
The title of the members of the assembly, even if the committee is going to decide for “Members of the parliament” or “WPM”, the option of “MWP” is the one that is going to give a wider support to the public consultation.
It seems that the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the intention to achieve a consensus could mean that the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, will present the legal opinion on the changes in question.
The reform of the law will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualifying members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will vote on the final decision on the name during the debate on the legislation.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country.
The citizens of Catalonia will vote on Sunday if they want to change the name of their country to “Republic of Macedonia of the North”.
The consultation of the people is going to decide on a matter that has been going on for decades, with Greece, which already has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time that the name of its capital represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed the intentions of this country to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, has said he will ignore the referendum on the name change.
Those who are in favour, like the Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply the price to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem.
“Historically, the people here have always said that there was a bar and a church in each village,” says Mr. Adams.
“Today, it’s not who finishes first, but who finishes second.”
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars is possible to understand.
“The people have a different way of socializing today,” he says.
“The bars have already become a nuisance to the people who live nearby. They are always there.”
The person who takes the most time to get to the restaurants, worries that the dinners that are sold from the sale of tickets will not last as long as the leaders "and that they will have to wait an hour to leave."
The churches, could be replaced, by apartment blocks and condominiums, with the type of people who will not be of help to the temples that remain in the barri.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and that is why the city council will accelerate the process of demolishing all the churches, as it is highly unlikely that the majority of the people who move to these buildings are members of these churches.”
Two of the three white churches were built before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in the Fields in 1962.
The white Methodist congregation that was originally there has been there for the last 30 years.
A black congregation that has been there for a long time is going to buy the building.
St. Martin's will pass to a congregation of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who will lead a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, one of the main commercial streets of Harlem, which is resisting to contract or promote black people.
The 1939, an accidental fire will cause great damage to the building, and the reverend Johnson's parishioners will make plans to rebuild it, but when they try to get the money, they will be disappointed.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of the late Reverend Johnson and successor to the St. Martin's Church, will describe the bells with pride as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who will sound the carillon in July will describe it in a different way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, will also observe that the first hole of the world is going to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who is going to have to carry the ball to the green of the Riverside Church for the first time in 18 years.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's will not be replaced.
The one who has played at St. Martin's during the last two months, on the contrary, has been the complications of architectural history and the contracts of the architects and some of them were carried by the lay leaders of the church and the diocese.
The parish council, the parish priest, the head of the parish, will write to the diocese in July to express their concern that the diocese "pretends to transmit the costs" to the parish council, but that this last will not be involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the diocese will send.
Some faithful have complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A bullfighter was killed by a 13-year-old boy while looking for stray cattle in California.
A bull will attack and kill a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while searching for a lost calf in California, the first day of the season for bullfighting, according to authorities.
The attack will take place just before 7am near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel, a meteorologist at KSWB-TV in San Diego, he was driving to work with some friends on Saturday morning when he felt the effects of a new demand for help. The group arrived at the location and found a group of people trying to help the man out of the water.
He will think that he has caught a lobster, but then he will say "I have caught a lobster!"
He had all his collarbone stripped off, and he's going to see us when he gets here.
“Because everyone is coming out of the water, I shouted: 'There is a bull in the water!'”, said Hammel.
The child will be transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and he will be in a very bad state.
We don't know which bull is the one responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, the paramedic Larry Giles said that he had detected a bull in the area for the past few weeks, but that he had decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles will add that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the thorax.
The authorities will close the beaches from Ponto Beach to Swami's from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. for 48 hours due to the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles will point out that there are more than 135 species of bull in the area, but that the majority of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, to the market of the products of beauty of the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's has decided to run the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products in the style of the big department stores.
These great passes are only part of the considerable investment in the beauty products market in the United Kingdom, a market that is worth £2.8 billion and which continues to grow while the fashion and beauty sectors are doing well, and which will be able to prove it by opening more shops in the country this year.
The investment in beauty products is the result of the desire of the super-markets to take advantage of the space available to them to offer their services which were previously destined for television, radio and other products of the like.
Sainsbury's says it will double its beauty offer by adding 3,000 different products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also have more space for brands that look like the ones you can find in Boots.
The company of supermercats is also found in the phase of re-launching of its product range of make-up Boutique so that the majority of the products are suitable for vegans, a feature that is increasingly demanded by consumers.
The chain of The Fragrance Shop, which is opening two new shops in Sainsbury's, will open its first shop in Croydon next week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The Internet and the change in habits have made it possible for people to buy smaller quantities of food every day in smaller supermarkets, which has made it possible for the big supermarkets to find other ways of convincing people to buy.
According to Mike Coupe, the head of Sainsbury's, the supermarkets will be assembling more and more stores in bigger and bigger spaces in order to compete with the discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced points of sale of Argos in many of its supermarkets, as well as Habitat stores, which will acquire both chains in full, the latter of which, he says, has helped to boost sales of white goods and increase the durability of purchases.
The original intention of the chain of supermercats to launch their departments of beauty and pharmacy will result in a failure.
Sainsbury's is going to carry out a joint operation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but it will end up in a hurry in not being able to agree on how to divide the benefits of the chain of pharmacies in the supermarkets.
This new strategy has been in place for three years after the sale of 281 Sainsbury's pharmacies to LloydsPharmacy, for £125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have a very important paper in the global market, as it will expand its range of luxury brands for the skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have changed the appearance of our products of beauty to improve the environment for our customers."
We have changed the working formats to be of great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any need; on the other hand, the environment and the location of the store are factors that make it one of the most attractive destinations for beauty products and cosmetics.
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby was paid £11 million for a TV show.
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby was paid £11 million to endorse a fashion line for Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote himself to the joint venture with the company Truly.
The negotiation between these two characters had reached the point where they were comparing the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, who is 37 years old, is going to use Instagram to announce her marriage.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' Den Peter Jones furious by pulling out of the final minute of the deal with a lifestyle brand to concentrate on her own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also report big benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was furious when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the agreements with the presenter, for a value of 1.5 million pounds, implied that he would no longer have time to devote to the joint products of the brand and accessories Truly.
The negotiations had reached a point where the company was trying to double the fortune of Willoughby, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, is not playing golf, he will be using Instagram to announce his marriage to Jones, who will be flying a private jet to one of his vacation homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to a source: "It was Holly's main priority on Sunday."
He was destined to be your future husband and I would have seen him for the first time in 20 or 30 years.
His decision to play on will leave no room for doubt in the minds of all the players.
No one could believe that the one who was going to pass the day before, was so close to the hole...
There is a shop next to Marlow's central station where you can buy anything.
According to the experts, the star of the This Morning show, one of the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions of pounds due to the important investment in products, from coixins and mirrors to roba and roba, and the possibility of delays in the launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been keeping a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for two years.
Willoughby will found a new tournament with Capp and Jones, both 52 years old, in April.
The two of them are always together during the holidays. In addition, Jones has a 40% share in the production company of Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the new ambassador of Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.
A proper font for Jones to comment on is that "They will not make any comment on their negotiations."
Hard accusations... "I'll fall in love with you later"
I'm making fun of the possible criticisms that some people would make about this comment, and because I think that the president's opinion is very positive and optimistic.
Why has Trump given up so much?
Trump will say, "I'm going to make a fool of this guy who thinks he's a news presenter."
“He hasn’t given up.”
You will notice that Kim had an interest in celebrating a second meeting after the first meeting held in Singapore in June was declared a great success in the denuclearization of North Korea.
The negotiations on nuclear disarmament are at a standstill.
More than three months after the historic summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho will comment on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not want a "response in kind" from the United States to its recent initiatives for denuclearization.
The US continues to apply sanctions with the objective of maintaining pressure.
Trump's view of the world, in change, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
We declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people have lost their lives.
I am maintaining this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: the tests with missiles, help for the hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
I will defend your usual focus on the relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but when you have 10,000 people trying to get into this place, you need a lot of cops, and we have about 200 of them.”
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths caused by a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it will tell the non-governmental organizations in other countries that they were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok will have to be relocated, the government will not declare a national disaster, but will ask for international aid to be able to help the victims.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, so the situation is very urgent,” says Mrs. Sumbung.
If Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not sure that foreign people can work on the land.
Mr. Sutopo, head of the National Disaster Management Agency, will comment that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if it is possible or not for international agencies to provide assistance.
The constant earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the country is unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Even though the Aceh have built refuges in case of tsunami, they are not frequent in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami sirens in Palu, even though there was an alert in force, is likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the enormous number of islands in Indonesia is, in the best of cases, like a reptile.
The natural disasters make it more difficult to organize the logistics.
A rescue ship that was trying to reach Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is now heading to Palu; it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
The president Joko Widodo had the best plan for the country's infrastructure, and he invested a lot of money in roads and railways.
The governor of Joko's government is facing the election this year, with the deficit of the economy.
Joko also faces the pressure of the permanent tensions between the country's two main political parties, the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1000 deaths and a million displaced people are the result of the battles that take place on the streets between Christian and Muslim bands with arrows, crossbows and other blood-smeared weapons.

“I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play as far forward as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible, as I did.”
“I saw Kanté coming, I saw him coming and I didn’t think about it, I just focused on hitting the ball.”
Chelsea won 1-0 after scoring a goal in the 25th minute thanks to their Belgian star Eden Hazard.

The statue of Cromwell in the British Parliament has been vandalized again, this time by someone who has written "rewrite history" on it.
His disappearance would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England by the puritan fanatics.
The Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "bogeria" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would become one of the main objects.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars will not be ordered or ended by Cromwell.
Perhaps they will sacrifice the Cromwell incorrectly for the actions of their previous life that they will do during the last century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of the historiography of a figure that many people think deserves to be commemorated.
Goldsmith will tell The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many to be the greatest parliamentarian of the 19th century, and a defender of the parliament before the external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
If this is a complete representation of the Roman theme, it is a historically accurate one.
The one who is sure of himself is that the conflict of means of the 17th century will determine the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents this division.
The Lord Protector's congratulations are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A pig has killed a farmer who was out for a walk.
A pig will be attacked and killed by a wild boar in a market in the south-west of Xina, according to local reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a deep cut in his arm and covered in blood, like a pig at the market in Liupanshui, the provincial capital of Guizhou.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a shed in Xining, Qinghai province.
The man who had been to Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs, had left the town on Wednesday.
The next morning, the player will find a door or a window open that leads to a pigsty.
According to him, there was a pig with a big mouth at the corner.
The forensic examination will confirm that the 250 kg man had killed the golfer, according to the information.
“My caddy had the shortest caddies and the most blood-filled caddies,” said Wu, whose caddy is named “Wu,” according to the news from the evening of Guiyang.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 in the morning on Thursday to feed the pigs.
The player's score will be found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the property of Yuan or of his son.
One of the market's managers will comment on the news of the evening that the pig will be shot and killed to avoid further attacks, while the police gather the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the people responsible for the market are negotiating a settlement for Yuan's death.
There have been many cases of pigs attacking humans.
The 2016, a pig is going to attack a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and the man will be left with serious injuries.
A few days ago, a pig weighing 300 kg was stolen from a farmer. His wife was so frightened that she could only scare the animal away with the help of her husband.
After a farmer in Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba is going to tell the CBC news that pigs are normally not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They like to play.
They are just children, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't go out with the idea of doing wrong.
Only give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the south-west of the US.
According to the predictions, Rosa is weakening as he advances northward along the coast of Mexico.
The Rosa will carry heavy rains throughout the north of Mexico and the south-west of the USA during the next days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, which is a category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 am on Monday, local time in the US, and is located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that the Rosa will be displaced north on Sunday.
However, the depression is expected to continue moving eastward across the Pacific Ocean, and it is forecast to approach the coast of the United States by the middle of the week. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will begin to interact with a strong tropical storm, and it will leave a strong tropical heat plume in its wake as it moves northward and eastward.
The Rosa will leave on Monday if it rains in some parts of Mexico.
The humidity will increase, and the depression will approach, generating torrential rains over the entire south-west during the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rainfall will cause flash floods, flows of runoff and the possibility of soil erosion.
The strong tropical heat will cause heavy precipitation rates of 50 to 75 mm per hour in various parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Expect 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the south-west, especially in Arizona.
There is the possibility that the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous because of the rapid dispersion of the tropical storms.
It is completely unadvisable to enter the desert before the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable. In addition, the storms could carry rocks and clouds to specific points.
The depression that is approaching will bring torrential rains to the coast of southern California.
It is possible that the precipitation totals over 50 mm, which could cause minor flows and minor roads to be flooded.
It is the first precipitation of the season in the region.
The players will begin arriving in Phoenix, Arizona, on Thursday night, before the rain has subsided, before dawn on Monday.
The torrential rains that are forecast for tomorrow will continue throughout the rest of the week.
There will be some important oscillations in temperature in the US in October, as the Arctic is cooling, and the tropics are getting colder.
This phenomenon can cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The region of the center of the United States is a clear example of drastic differences in temperature on the same day.
There have been differences in temperature of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the hot days of summer, the persistent heat will try to expand further.
It is expected that the month of October will start with high temperatures in the center and east of the United States, with temperatures of 27 degrees from the southern plains to the north-east.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Wednesday, which would be 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures will be above the average for the first half of October in the United States.
More than 20 million people will see Brett Kavanaugh's declaration.
More than 20 million spectators will be able to see the passionate testimony of the candidate for a member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who will accuse him of sexual abuse, which is expected to take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The witness will be broadcast on six different television channels.
However, the political impasse continued, with the usual programming on Fridays interrupted by the events of the last minute: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to complete its investigation of the allegations during the past week.
Ford will explain to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh was going to try to rape her and that he was going to try to steal her underwear at a party at the institute.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, will say that he was absolutely convinced that this would not pass.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million spectators will have seen this testimony on Friday.
The company counted the number of viewers of the cable channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The audience figures for the hearing are not available immediately for other channels that will be broadcasting the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen has problems calculating the number of people who want to see him from his office.
It is a competition similar to a playoff game in American football or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the leaders of opinion on this channel have clearly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, it will be the channel with the most audience, with a share of 5.69 million viewers during the testimony of the whole day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC will be second with 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS will get 3.1 million, the NBC 2.94 million, the MSNBC 2.89 million and the CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest is maintained after the testimony.
Flake will be the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the Republican moderates issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on camera by the CNN and CBS studios in the morning of Friday while trying to get into an elevator to go to a meeting with Kavanaugh.
Flake will be forced to spend several minutes with his eyes closed while being interviewed live on CNN.
“Here, you’re ahead of me,” she’ll say.
“Do you think that the truth is in the country?”
You think you have power, but there are so many things you don't have!
Flake will say that the office has sent a message and, before the elevator doors close, will say that he has more to say to the committee.
At 5pm, all the cable channels and the internet are broadcasting live the moment the Senate Judiciary Committee votes on whether to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Flake will say, in the meantime, that only the FBI will investigate the allegations against the nominee for the week that is coming, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake will be convinced by the conversations he will have with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake will take his decision.
The third option, which had influence, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not vote for Kavanaugh without the support of the Democrats.
The president Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The first British Prime Minister, Theresa May, accuses the critics of playing politics in relation to the Brexit.

Sims had 20 years of experience.
He was 1.98 m tall, and played basketball in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU Tigers.
You will have a 5.6 point lead and 2.6 rebounds per game to start the season.
The morning of Thursday, the coach of the LSU basketball team Will Wade will say that the team is "broken" and that the death of Wayde will be "a very strong blow".
“These things are the ones that make you suffer in every moment,” Wade will say.
A volcano will spew ash into the city of Mexico.
The ashes of the volcano Popocatepetl have arrived in the barrels of the south of Mexico City.
The Mexican National Center for Disaster Prevention will warn the Mexicans on Saturday that the volcano is still active after detecting increased activity and emissions of gas and ash over a 24-hour period.
The centre was supervising various cracks and tremors that had recently occurred.
Images of the social networks are appreciated on the fine layer of ash on the roofs of the cars in the streets of Mexico City, like in Xochimilco.
Geophysical data have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the capital, when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
The "Don Goyo" Volcano, has been active since 1994.
The police confronts separatists Catalans before the anniversary of the referendum on independence.
People who were demonstrating for independence in Barcelona on Saturday were confronted by the police and thousands of people joined the counter-demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the Catalan referendum that will take place in Catalonia on the 11th of September.
A group of independentists, who are protesting against the police, have started to paint the road signs and to fill them with black paint, which will cause the appearance of black clouds on the roads normally used by tourists.
The next day, the police will produce bats with which to beat the protesters.
For several hours, independentist groups have been shouting “No to forgive, no to forget” to the faces of unionist demonstrators who are shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people have been arrested for throwing stones during the protests, according to local sources.
The tensions have not decreased in this region of mental attitude independentist one year after the October 1st referendum considered illegal by Madrid but also dut to be carried out by the separatists Catalans.
The voters will vote to decide on independence for a large majority, but the participation index will be low, as the opponents of secession will boycott the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the regional elections, which led to violent confrontations.
The independentist groups will camp out all night on Thursday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration will take place at the same time, but the demonstrators will be forced to take a different route.
Narcís Termes, an electrician of 68 years and one of the participants in the independence demonstration with his wife, will say that he no longer has any hopes about the possibilities that Catalonia has to become independent.
“Last year was one of the best moments.”
I'm going to see my friends crying with joy because they can now vote, but we're stuck here.
Despite winning a vital victory, they still fell short of the majority needed to declare independence. The Catalan parties have suffered for months to maintain their independence, and many of their leaders have been in exile or under arrest. They are still waiting for their papers to be served, and for the court to declare them guilty of rebellion.
Joan Puig, a mechanic of 42 years, records the demonstration of support for the police with his mobile phone, and says that the conflict has revived the political leaders of both bands.
“The tension doesn’t increase, but rather decreases,” he says.
The next Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new leaders of Catalonia, will announce that he will participate in the European elections next year.
“To present oneself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the retrograde values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government.”
Londonderry: Homes are being built after investing in a house with a garden.
Three homes of 33, 34 and 39 years have been destroyed after repeated attacks on a house in Londonderry.
The incident will take place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. local time.
The inspector Bob Blemmings said that they will cause damage to the doors and the same building.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has shot a ball at the goal.
A goal by Menga gives Livingston the victory over Rangers by 1-0.
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingston will decide the victory.
Livingston, who had been playing in the second division, will surprise Glasgow Rangers, who have lost their last two games under Steven Gerrard, who is the second coach to lose two games in a row in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's shot will make the difference, as this victory will put Gary Holt's team in second place, sharing the position with Hibs.
Gerrard, in change, will continue to play without leaving home this season. On Sunday, they will face the leader, Hearts, who separate them by eight points.
But before that, Rangers beat Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, has won all but one of his last six matches, with Kenny Miller replacing him as coach. He has been unable to win a league match since the Scot took over.
The Livingston doesn't take advantage of the opportunities offered by the visiting team.
The Rangers's team would have had to score before the goal, as the Holt team would have caused all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson is going to open the path between the defense, but he will not be able to take advantage of the opportunity when he finds himself in front of the goal. After that, Alan Lithgow will send the ball out to stretch himself in order to try to score the pass from Craig Halkett, which will create the opportunity.
As local residents already know that the Rangers can easily defend their area, so they don't have to worry about the visitors' games.
This is how we will decide the winner.
The referee will give a foul against the interests of Rangers and Livingston will open the scoring with a goal from the left, on Declan Gallagher and Robinson will combine to score the first and finish from the center of the area.
At that moment, Rangers had dominated possession, but they were unable to break down a resolute defence and a Liam Kelly who had little to do all game.
The scenario will repeat itself in the second half, and Alfredo Morelos will force Kelly to make a merit.
For the Rangers, Allan McGregor will be on the bench, and Scott Pittman and Lithgow will be on the bench.
The Rangers are going to dedicate a player and another pilot to the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, they are going to claim two penalties, one for a supposed entry of Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for a foul. Both are going to be rejected.
Livingston “phenomenal”: analysis
Alasdair Lamont from the BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks they will be excellent, and they follow through on all their expectations in this ascendent trajectory.
His style of play and his personal qualities have not changed since he returned to the top flight, and much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team from the moment he arrived.
We're going to have a good team.
The captain Halkett will be immense at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall will have to be on guard throughout the game.
The Rangers will have to work hard to get the inspiration they need.
In the brilliant moments that Gerrard has shown as a coach, it is clear that he has not been able to maintain the level.
We don't know how to create chances (only one player has managed to do so clearly), and the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, would have to take it as a warning.
A rough reception for Erdogan in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany will meet for breakfast on Saturday (29 September) in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of the Turkish president to Germany, who had the objective of repairing the relations between the two NATO allies.
These have deteriorated because of the rights of humans, the freedom of the press and the entry of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan, who has been following, will move to Colonia to inaugurate a new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police will be alleging a breach of public order to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, if there are a large number of followers, they will have to close the roads to be able to see their president.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters against Erdogan, many Kurds, also feel the need to condemn the political decisions of Erdogan as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him.
These two demonstrations reflect the division of opinion that exists among the visitors, considered a hero by some German Turks and a dictator by others.
Accident in Deptford: a cyclist killed by a car
A cyclist has died after colliding with a car in London.
The accident happened near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy area with lots of traffic, at 10:15am.
The driver of the vehicle is going to have to wait and see if the paramedics can save the cyclist, who is going to die in the act.
The accident happened about 16 days after another cyclist was killed in a collision with a car on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the site of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police have said that their agents are working to identify the man and inform his family of the facts.
The route has been laid and diversions have been put in place for the bus routes. In addition, the drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Six agents injured in an altercation
Security agents at the prison have been injured in a fight with inmates of high security, according to the office of the prison.
The executions will be carried out at the prison of Long Lartin, Worcestershire, at 9:30 am on Sunday, local time, and will continue.
The "tornado" agents, specially trained to move around the area to find the fugitives, have been seen in the area where seven prisoners have been released. The operation could have been contained by a cordon.
The agents have to be shot in the face to get the clues.
According to a statement from the prison service: "We have special training for prisoners who are trained to solve incidents like the one that is still ongoing at Long Martin, which is still ongoing.
The player has to be fit with strong legs.
We will not tolerate violence against our people. The people responsible for this altercation will have to answer to the police and could spend more time in jail.
At the centre for long-term prisoners in Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, we will know who the captain of the police force will be after he has been attacked by a recluse.
In October of last year, the agents of the anti-avalanche unit were present at the scene of a serious incident in which the staff of the centre was attacked with pool cues.
The Hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with heavy rains (the areas with heavy rainfall could benefit)
It is not usual that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of the week when the remnants of the hurricane Rosa pass through the south-west desert, with the consequent risk of flash floods.
The national weather service has issued warnings for flash floods in the Phoenix area, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City for Monday and Tuesday.
We are expecting that the Rose will arrive directly to Phoenix on Monday and that he will take the lead on Tuesday night.
The national meteorological service of Phoenix will comment on a storm that only two tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or depression in a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
The hurricane Katrina (1967) will be 64 km from the border with Arizona.
The most recent models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts of 150 mm in Mogollon, Arizona.
Other areas of the desert of the south-east, enclosed by the Rocalloses central and the Gran Conca, could register between 25 and 50 mm, with the possibility of snowfalls of up to 100 mm.
For the areas that are outside the risk of flooding, the Rosa flood could become a very good news, as the region is suffering a strong drought.
Although the rains are a source of great concern, some precipitations could be very beneficial, since the south-west region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the servey of control of the US, more than 40% of the state of Arizona has a minimum of extreme weather, the second highest category.
But first, Rosa will play on the Baja California peninsula, in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have force on Sunday morning, with winds of 137 km/h, and was found at 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is getting stronger and colder at the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected that the player will play the course with force of a tropical storm in the late afternoon or evening of Monday.
The precipitations in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of floods.
According to weather.com, "75 to 150 mm of total rainfall is expected from Baja California to the north-east of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north to Mexico, where a tropical storm will be brewing, before arriving at the Arizona border at first light on Tuesday with the storm in full force. Finally, the state of Arizona will be reached by Tuesday night.
“The main risk we are expecting from Rosa or from the one who remains is strong precipitations in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the desert of the south-west of the US”, according to the national centre of hurricanes.
It is expected that the plugs will cause dangerous flash floods and flash floods in the desert, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four suspects for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with serious injuries in Somerset.
The teenager will be found with serious injuries in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, at 4:00pm on Saturday, local time.
He will be transferred to the hospital, where they will find him "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old will be charged with the murder of a 17-year-old in Radstock, Somerset.
The agents have made a call to anyone who can help to identify the person who took the pictures with the mobile phone.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for the party’s despicable and disgusting tactics,” Trump declared in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump will say that Kavanaugh has “shown the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh will declare before the Congress tomorrow, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford in a very emotional and forceful manner, that he has sexually abused her many years ago, when they were both adolescents.
Ford also will declare under oath about the contents of his affidavit.
The president is going to say on Saturday that "the American people will see the genius, the quality of humanity and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the brightest moments in the history of the legal world, a jurist with an admirable career of service to the citizenry of Virginia’s Western District.”
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the participation index of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“We are at the most important elections of our lives.”
I didn't run, but in reality I did.
“For that I’m going to fight for all our great candidates.”
Trump will argue that the Democrats are trying to "resist and obstruct."
It is expected that the first vote on the Kavanaugh nomination will take place in the Senate on Friday, according to a Senate aide who spoke to CNN.
Thousands of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims continues to rise.
With a minimum of 384 people dead, and many more injured, the authorities have said that the landslides caused by the severe flooding and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi have affected the whole of the island.
Hundreds of people have gathered on the beach to celebrate a festival with the aim of breaking the world record for the longest beach volley ball game, which will be played at the beach in Palu, a town on the coast, 100 metres from the shore, and will cover a distance of 100 metres. The game will be played by two teams of 10 players, and the ball must be kept in the air for at least 10 seconds.
The tsunami will follow a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat was imminent, the people were still on the beach and not running away. They were victims of the disaster,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency in Jakarta.
“The tsunami is not going to come in a few minutes, it will sweep away trees, trunks, houses, it will destroy everything that was on the ground,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
There are people who can survive a tsunami by climbing a tree.
16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 different shelters in Palu.
Photographs of aerial views published by the agency for disaster mitigation show the quantity of buildings and bridges destroyed, bridges turned over and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replays will continue to be shown from this coastal city this Saturday.
The series of tremors will be felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) will say in a statement that the energy released by the thermonuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, will be equivalent to 200 megatons of the energy released by the bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow valley, could have increased exponentially the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho will describe the days as "considerable" and will say that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels will be demolished.
Some of the victims' clothes, which were trapped between the ruins of the buildings, were found. 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the injured could increase the coast to 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "will be completely paralyzed and there will be no way to get information" from Donggala, says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people there,” said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy that could end badly,” he says.
The agency will be heavily criticized on Saturday for not informing of the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, and that the agents will say that the warnings will be issued during the time when the tsunami will arrive.
In a recording of an aficionado who shares the social networks, it is possible to feel like a man on the top floor of a building desperate for warning to the people of the street about the tsunami that is approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water sweeps away the shore, carrying away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters will not be able to authenticate the recording immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami have caused a general blackout of the electricity ministry, which has interrupted communications with Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the aid has begun to be sent by air from Jakarta and other cities, the evacuees are still in need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city will be open only for emergency and rescue flights until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
The tsunami death toll in Indonesia is estimated at over 800.
The situation is very difficult.
Although workers of World Vision are able to reach Palu without any problems, they are staying in tents installed in the office yard, during the trip they will have to witness scenes of total destruction, according to Doseba.
“They will see many destroyed houses,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
But that the groups of aid are going to make the terrible gesture of starting the tasks of assistance, some people are going to complain that humanitarian workers are going to be prevented from going to Palu.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, the collection of water, the provision of food and the deployment of foreign personnel can only begin if a disaster has occurred in the area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, captain of the Indonesian women’s national team.
“A cop who the government says ‘it’s a disaster’, can start to ask for international help, but it hasn’t been declared at this level.”
While the second night after the earthquake and tsunami, the friends and relatives of the missing people are keeping the hope that the miracle will happen and their loved ones will be found alive.
Saturday, a boy is trapped in a keyhole.
On Sunday, the rescue teams will free a woman who has been trapped under the rubble for two days with the cost of her life.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parapent team, had trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which will conclude at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, there were his students.
“In the senior category, I have my own emotional baggage,” he said.
Mr. Gendon will explain that, in the hours following the news that the hotel Roa Roa had collapsed between the parapentist community, he had sent desperate messages to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the festival on the beach.
The messages appear with a gray mark on accounts with a double blue mark.
“I think that’s what you’re trying to say,” he added.
Two thieves were shot and killed during the robbery of a security guard at a mall in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday, two men stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was working at a cash machine at Newport on the Levee. The men were caught on camera.
The agent Dennis McCarthy will indicate to the press that the driver of the vehicle was driving the automatic gate at the entertainment complex and was preparing to distribute more meals.
While the other man is taking a dump, another man "is going to take care of the job for Brink's" and he's going to steal a bag of money destined for distribution.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw various suspicious people fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects in the incident.
Anyone who sees any information about these people should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper is changing his name to Ye
Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "I've known Kanye West for a long time."
West, who is 41 years old, has been using the nickname Ye for the past 8 years, and he will use it as the title of his 8th album, which will be released in June.
The change is produced before the appearance of the artist on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper will be replaced by Ariana Grande, who will cancel her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think that’s the most important word in the Bible, and it means you,” West said at the beginning of this year, while talking about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
So that's how you do it.
He passed away from Kanye, who wanted to be simply Ye, which is a reflex of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, all.
The album is more a reflection of what is happening around us.»
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have adopted the name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, an anti-collaborator of West, has changed his name to all capital letters and without spaces.
The president of Mexico, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians.
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised not to use the military against civilians, as long as the country is in a state of emergency for the 50th anniversary of a brutal crackdown on students.
López Obrador will promise on Saturday at the Tlatelolco plaza that "we will not use the military force to repress the Mexican people anymore."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people in an era when student movements were active in Latin America.
López Obrador, who has promised to give support to young Mexicans by providing monthly stipends to students and to build more public universities,
He has declared that the lack of educational opportunities and the lack of opportunities for young people to get a job make them turn to crime.
The US is doubling the funds destined to AI.
While the Xina is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US would have to double the amount of money they spend on research in this area.
The comments come after several members of the US government have announced measures in the field of AI, despite the fact that the country has a general lack of formal strategy in AI.
However, Xina will present her new project next year: her goal is to become the number one in the world in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the pressupost dedicated to AI research would be a good start, but other countries are already far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the AI revolution,” Lee said.
“Doubling the funding could double the opportunities that the US is offering in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the founder and CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In 1980, he will work at Carnegie Mellon University on a system of artificial intelligence that will surpass the American player of Othello with the best classification and, later, will work as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
He will value positively the technological competitions of the North American government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA), and will ask where the next one will be held in order to identify the proper visionaries.
“Sometimes, the American investigators have to work hard to get public funding,” Lee will say.
According to Lee, "It's not Xina who gets angry with the leaders; it's the companies."
In the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired hundreds of university graduates to work on artificial intelligence.
He will comment that the US's attitude towards the EU in the area of AI could also be influenced by changes in immigration policy.
“We will automatically offer residency permits to PhD students in AI,” he said.
The council of the Xina will present its plan for the development of artificial intelligence on the 17th of July.
The National Foundation for Scientific Research of the Xina grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way as the Foundation for Scientific Research and other public organizations in the US do to researchers from the US, but the quality of the work is inferior to that of the Xina.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defense of the United States is going to create a Center for Artificial Intelligence Joint, conceived to bring together collaborators from the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House is going to announce the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, the DARPA has announced a $2,000 million investment in a new initiative called AI Next.
The Foundation for the Natural Sciences, which now spends more than 100 million dollars a year on research in artificial intelligence.
However, it has been months since the US government has not applied the measure in relation to the legislation that was supposed to create a National Commission for Artificial Intelligence Security.
The Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide on the name of the country.
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will vote on a referendum to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's applications to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern region constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
June, the two governments will arrive at an agreement on the new name, but the nationalists argue that the change would alter the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is raising doubts as to whether the minimum participation of 50% will be reached.
The question asked on the referendum ballot is: "Are you in favor of the adhesion to NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
The prime minister of the country, Zoran Zaev, argues that it is worth paying the price to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that will create a new arc of instability in the Balkans, organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I voted for the future of the country, because the young people of Macedonia want to live in freedom in the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” says Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Even if it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it binding.
To change the name, it requires a two-thirds majority in the Parliament.
The Electoral Commission of the State will inform that no irregularities have been detected at the 13th hour.
Only 16% of the population participated in the election, compared to the 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, which were held in 2016, in which 66% of the people registered voted.
“I have voted for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in Skopje.
The Macedonian prime minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in favor of the referendum on the name change of the country, which would open the way to EU and NATO membership for Macedonia and Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of the tents for the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join through the back door, not through the back door,” he will say.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept Macedonia, they can go to other countries, like China and Russia, and form part of the European integration.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, has said that the country's accession to NATO will be accompanied by investments that are necessary for Macedonia, which has a tax rate of more than 20%.
“I think that the majority of citizens will vote in favor, because more than 80% of citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said before depositing his petition.
Zaragoza will show that a "yes" would mean "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies, between 30% and 43% of voters participated in the referendum, a shortfall of at least 10% below the minimum required.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV channel, 57% of the respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would declare that they would vote "yes".
Because the referendum is valid, the participation must be at least 50% more than the vote.
A failure in the referendum would mean the first crack in the wall for the pro-Western government of the Spanish state, which is going to take over the reins of power in the next few days.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, scores a goal after dribbling the whole defense of Brighton.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling scored the goals that gave Manchester City a 2-0 win over Brighton in the Premier League match at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) on Saturday.
Aguero is going to score a goal in the 65th minute in a play that will seem ridiculous.
The forward Argentinian player will run past the midfield player at the start of the sequence.
We'll be running at full speed between three defenders of Brighton, and the one who got the ball out of the pitch.
After that, Agüero will be surrounded by four green samarretes.
We'll have to defend a little more before we can get to the Brighton area.
After that, he will pass to his left, where Sterling will be.
The English player will be the first to hit the ball, from the tee, in the area, at Agüero, who with the right-footed shot will beat the Brighton goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that will go inside the area.
“Agüero has some problems,” Pep Guardiola, the City coach, told the journalists.
We have decided that you will play between 55 and 60 minutes.
This is the one who has passed.
We are lucky that we scored a goal at that moment.
But Sterling will give the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal will arrive at the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero will go deep into the Brighton's defense and
He will make a beautiful pass to the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sterling will drive the car before passing it to Sane at the end of the race.
The Sky Blues' striker will score the winning goal before the ball leaves the pitch.
The City faces Hoffenheim on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage, at 18:55 h, at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, will eliminate the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off, there was no need for any other opening.
But Scherzer, who is very competitive, is waiting to see if he can get out of the bullpen on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who have a lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to play in the playoffs.
The Rockies won the game 5-2 against the Nationals on Thursday night, but still need to win the series to get their first division title.
“We’ll play as little as possible, at least until we know the conditions here, in Denver, and they’ll know that the other team probably will play at a higher level, because no one has played at this level this year.”
Why would you want to lose this game?
The Nationals have already announced a reliever for Saturday, but it seems they are determined to let Scherzer pitch if he wants to.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening day start, will throw a bullpen session on Tuesday and would pitch on Thursday, his usual day of rest.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington has a record of 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump has a meeting with Virginia from the West.
The president is going to indirectly refer to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
All who have played are in the game in November.
Fold five times for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the great, great, great.. I don't want to present, but in reality I do want to present. For that reason, I'm going to fight with the fantastic candidates.
Trump will continue: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, they are still here."
They are determined to recover all the power they need, and they see the meanness of their character, their bad intentions.
It doesn't matter who wins or loses, but who has the power and control. That's what counts: power and control. But they won't give it to you.»
The mission of the Democrats is to resist and obstruct.
“You can see it in the next four days,” he said, and he will call the Democrats “enutjats, mesquins, bruts and false.”
Trump will attack Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic senator from California, who will be the most senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for having a very strong record of opposing his judicial nominees.
Did you remember the answer?
Should we filter the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, no. Wait a moment... This is a very painful expression of the body language, the most painful expression I have seen.
The Labour Party has become a party of the middle class.
It is intolerant to those who think.
When the activists of Momentum from my local party vote to censure me, it won't surprise me.
At the end of the day, and the last of a series of British parliamentarians who have said that we are not welcome, we are saying that we think they are wrong.
My colleague in the parliament, Joan Ryan, is going to introduce a bill similar to the one she has already introduced to combat anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I will be criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Incidentally, similar questions that Jeremy disagreed with the leaders of the past.
In the notice of the meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party on Friday it was announced that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the last eight years as a Labour councillor, the meetings of the General Committee have been held on a Friday night.
Unfortunately, this is not the way to many meetings, and it has been a long time since the promise of politicians "more generous and friendly" was forgotten, so that sometime it will exist.
Each time it is more evident that the divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is justified in function of whether it is acceptable for the direction of the party.
This will start soon after Jeremy has won the leadership, as he and his colleagues had been expecting that he would do, since they had thought that he would turn a 180-degree corner and take positions that he had not previously adopted, such as on national security or on the single market for the EU.
Whenever I speak in public, I say what I say, the social networks fill up with aggressive messages because they want me to renew my candidacy, they say that the politicians of the center have to be denounced, and they say that there wouldn't be a Labor Party.
This is not for me alone.
Of course, I have more experience than some of my colleagues, since I have missed more shots than they.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and we will not stop.
One of the most deceiving aspects of this era is to see how normalised the abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn will declare this week that the Labour Party will promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the game is not as diverse as it used to be, and with each change in the rules, the game is being renewed.
In the last two years I have received many good tips and I have been advised to keep the head down, which is not so easy.
But I didn't enter politics for that.
As soon as I joined the Labour Party, when I was 32 years old, in my student years, encouraged by the negligent government of Thatcher, which was going to leave my class literally buried, I tried to defend public services better for those who need them more, either as a local councillor or as a minister of the government.
I have not hidden my political views, nor have I done so in the last elections.
Nottingham East could not doubt our political positions and the points of disagreement with the current direction.
Those who are promoting the motion for a second referendum on Thursday, I would tell them that in a moment in which the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm our businesses and public services, not to mention the loss of time and energy that we would have to spend on this motion.
But, in reality, the message I want to transmit is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my Labour Party members, or to those who are not members of the Labour Party but who are my supporters: I am proud to serve you and I promise that I will not renew my candidacy or any other interest that may prevent me from doing so. According to my assessment, the interests of all of you will be served.
Chris Leslie is a member of the Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr beat the leaders
Two late goals distort the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr will win the game.
The Ayr, who are the only undefeated teams in the league, occupy the first position on the table.
In the end, the local team is going to be victorious thanks to their superior defensive play and the fact that they know how to take advantage of the opportunities better than the other team.
“The matches that we have played so far have put us to the test, and we have to be satisfied with that, so I am.”
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, will comment: "Well done to Ayr, they took their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's try at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead, but a try by Rory Hughes for the international Scot, allowed the Warriors to take the lead, and Jason Baggott's try was not converted.
The Ayr will widen the advantage with a sanction and, just after the half, will score a try and convert it to put the score at 17-5 in favor of the Ayr.
But the Melrose will start well and the second part will be very difficult for Patrick Anderson, who will score a try, reducing the difference to five points.
After the break, the game is going to be interrupted for a long time because of the difficult injury that is going to suffer Ruaridh Knott, who is going to be taken off in writing, and at the restart the Ayr will widen the distance with a assault of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Next, the substitute captain Blair Macpherson is cautioned with a yellow card and, once again, the Melrose team takes advantage of the superiority of a home player to convert a try by Bruce Colvine in the final minutes of the match.
The local team will react and when Struan Hutchinson sees Climo without a pilot, he will take a penalty shot from the back of the line, MacPherson will score a goal from behind the goal.
The weather is going to be a factor, as it has been since the start of the round, when Kyle Rowe hit a shot out of David Armstrong's reach and passed the ball to Gregor Henry to score the fifth shot of the local team.
The star of the series Still Game seems to be about to start a new career in the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, star of the TV series Still Game, seems to be about to move into the hotel business, after it was discovered that he has been named director of a restaurant with a license.
The actor, who is 56 years old, plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he wrote and co-produced with Greg Hemphill, his comedy partner for many years.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will refuse to make a comment on the respect, and one of the journalists from The Scottish Sun will point out that Kiernan had intended to enter the "florent sector of the restaurant business" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, without a coastline, waits for the court to reopen the route to the Pacific.
The sailors patrol the sea for the safety of the city of La Paz.
The public buildings are painted blue.
The bases of the Amazon and the Titicaca are all covered with the slogan: "The sea is ours."
Recovering it is a good idea.
The territory without a coastline of Bolivia, the record of a lost coast before Xile in a conflict of resources cruel in the 19th century is still vivid, as it is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the deepest in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, I must say, a positive attitude towards the result,
Many Bolivians will watch the resolution of the Tij on large screens in the country, with the hope that the Hague Tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia, which, after decades of negotiations, Xile is obliged to negotiate the exit of a sovereign passage to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle for reelection this Sunday, also has many hopes pinned on the resolution of the dispute.
“We are very close to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts think it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia and, in case it does, things will not change much.
The United Nations Organization, based on the principle of non-intervention, has no power to adjudicate territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The resolution of the Tij, which is produced only after the presentation of the final allegations, indicates that the case "was not complicated", will say Paz Zárate, specialist in international law.
I think we'll see a lot of Bolivian players in the next four years.
The Bolivian government has blocked the question of access to the sea.
“The rhetoric of Morales has destroyed any chance of a good will gesture by Xile,” he will suggest.
Bolivia and Xile will continue talking, but it will be difficult to keep the conversation going after this episode.
The two countries have not had ambassadors since 1962.
The former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia at La Haia, will reject the idea that the decision of the Court was exceptionally rapid.
Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Xile" and "a unique opportunity to put an end to 139 years of disputes, with mutual benefits", he said.
Morales also denied that Morales, who is one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the question of maritime sovereignty as a political crossbow.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
“The opportunity is to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it will not give up its nuclear weapons unless the United States gives up its nuclear weapons.
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation will not give up its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
He's going to talk about it next Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The US minister will urge the US to keep its promises made during a ceremony in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries.
The declarations of the two leaders arrive at a moment when it seems that the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, is about to resume the nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three months after the summit celebrated in Singapore with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
It is a dream to think that the sanctions will continue and that the objection of the US to a declaration that puts North Korea in a state of war will make North Korea surrender.
Washington doubts whether North Korea will accept the declaration if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament moves.
Kim Jong-un wants to celebrate a second summit with Donald Trump.
There is a general scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's willingness to renounce its nuclear arsenal, which it considers the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo has said he will visit Pyongyang in the coming month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The parades of Paris reveal the latest collection of hats of large dimensions, from a main street to a street near you.
If you want to increase the size of your collection of sunglasses or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers have presented a collection of extravagant hats for the SS19 season, which will be worn by the models at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has been flooded with pictures of people playing golf, and these designers have brought their surprising creations to the golf shop.
The piece that will stand out the most in Valentino's collection will be a barrette with an exaggerated barrette, with a wide wing, which will flood the cap of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were also a beer cooler and a barbecue, but these were not designed to keep the players warm.
Thom Browne will also present a selection of masks for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of different colors, look like Hannibal Lecter than they do not have high fashion.
A submarine was being assembled with a crew of submarinists, with tubes and lights, while another seemed to be a container of gelat.
If you follow the big trends of fashion, you are out of date.
The observers of styles predict that the huge bunkers could be implanted in the main roads near you.
The big clubs hit the ball with a lot of force, and the ball goes flying.
The tag on the back of the shirt is so small that it will fall off the bars of the social networks and will carry another great creation to the beach: a ball bag for the beach, just like the one he was wearing.
The bossa of ràfia, of color taronja fosc, decorated with serrells of ràfia and finished with a white leather, will be the piece that will stand out of the Jacquemus SS19 collection of La Riviera for the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and big sunglasses on the beach this summer. The designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame if they were ignored."
John Edward: The linguistic skills are essential for the citizens of the world.
Scottish independent schools maintain an excellence in academic achievement that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by the individual and collective efforts in esports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to offer the best possible service to their pupils and their parents.
The independent schools have as their objective to prepare their students for higher education and for the career they will choose, and for their place in the world.
With a curriculum that can be designed and implemented by teachers, it is clear that the modern languages are a subject that is very popular and much sought after by schools.
Nelson Mandela will say: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you speak to him in his language, that goes to his heart."
If you speak to him in his own language, he will come to you.
This is a very important recorder that cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate confidence with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the exams in Catalan, we can see that the languages lead the tables of classification with the highest qualifications to the independent schools.
The 68% of the students who study foreign languages will obtain an A.
The data, collected from 74 schools member of the SCIS, will show that 72% of the students will obtain a qualification A in Catalan, while 72% of the students of Spanish, French and German will obtain a qualification A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland are giving support to foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will need without doubt in the future.
Currently, the languages, as a choice of subject, are maintained in the same way as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the independent schools and other places.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the Commission for Employment and Competences of the United Kingdom will reveal that the reasons why employers are not able to fill vacancies are the lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, the linguistic competences are becoming more and more important for preparing the young people for their future careers.
There are more opportunities for practice than ever before, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race that a person wins, if he has a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically makes a person multilingual before the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% do not know how to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double digit percentage.
For this reason, it is important for children to learn languages.
Knowing several languages, especially those developed by economies, will give children better opportunities to find a good job.
Scotland has a diversity of schools because they teach in different languages.
Some schools focus more on modern languages, while others teach us languages that are considered to be more important for the future, such as Japanese or Mandarin.
If your child is interested in learning a second language, you can choose between a series of schools that offer foreign language classes with teachers who are specialists in this area.
The independent Scottish schools are dedicated to providing an environment for learning that will prepare the children and give them the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of where they go.
In the commercial world of the present era, it is impossible to deny that the languages follow a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Of course, the modern languages are considered to be "real" "competences communicative" internationally.
The independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron James will debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait for the fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
The coach of the Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play the first game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But still they have to determine the minutes he will play.
Walton will be the first to arrive at the Lakers' official location.
Mike Trudell, Lakers' reporter, says that James will probably play few minutes.
After the training sessions of this week, James will ask about the Lakers' schedule for the next six games.
“I don’t need to play any more matches in this phase of my career to be ready.”
Trump's visit to Virginia from the West Coast, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump began a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, last night.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for this week, which will include visits to friendly states, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for the candidate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court is pending, Trump is trying to get support for his own election to a second term, since the Republicans run the risk of losing control of the Congress if the votes are held in November.
At what time is the meeting of Trump and Virginia from the West tonight and can we see it on line?
The meeting of Donald Trump and Mike Pence in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. EDT on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The meeting of Donald Trump and Virginia West can be seen live on the link that is specified below, through live video streaming on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will address the hearing this week of the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who will be tense because of the sexual abuse allegations against him, while the vote to confirm him is being delayed, and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this meeting is to help the Republicans who are present to get the necessary votes in November.
The five meetings of the campaign of President Trump for the next week are directed to "encourage volunteers and sympathizers, while the Republicans try to protect their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so important for the President's agenda that he will travel to so many states, even though we have not yet started a campaign season that is very aggressive, according to a White House official who asked not to be identified, according to Reuters.
This evening's match, scheduled for this evening at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of the communication networks of Pittsburgh.
Saturday will be the second time that Trump visits Virginia from the West, and we will win by more than 40 points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good signal for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a push in the investigations,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Virginia’s College at Wise, told Reuters.
The American Ryder Cup team shows its ambition to keep alive the hopes of the individual matches on Sunday.
After three uneven sessions, the foursomes on Saturday will probably be the match that this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a sporting concept invented, especially in competitions like this.
So, what is the positive dynamic cost?
“We have a one shot lead with six to play, so we’re in a good position,” Jordan Spieth said after the round.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four putts for a stroke, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, like Spieth, say the wind is in their favor and they have many reasons to be motivated, in part because of the state of form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will play together all day and both have three points.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee all the way to the green and is setting an example.
The low, guttural sounds of celebration were getting louder as the player continued his second round, and when Thomas had just two putts to win the match.
You'll celebrate the putt that he'll make to win the match on the 15th hole with a shot similar to the one he hit on the 14th hole, which indicates that he thinks the American is still in the competition.
“You have to work hard and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
It's all the players who are left.
18 forats to leave the course.
The two players with the most strokes, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, are the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The European couple are adorable, but they make no errors.
Moliwood will be the only pair that will not make a bogey on Saturday, and will also avoid bogeys on Saturday and Friday mornings.
This result and the way in which the player's energy seems to flow from the public to the player is reaffirmed that it is the players who play on Sunday, and not the ones who play on Thursday, who are the most popular.
Preferably, the two holes should be different.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson are going to finish quickly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, who will play with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first two holes will put the Spanish and the Swedes in a position where they will not have any option but to withdraw.
But on Thursday, no one can help him get out of the bunker.
The fourballs and the foursomes are very interesting to watch because of the interactions between the teams, the clubs that give and the clubs that don't, and the way a strategy can change from one hole to the next.
The Europeans have played better than the equipment and they will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursomes session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe will win the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 score.
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after winning the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari will have to work hard to win two victories against Tiger Woods in difficult conditions and leave their mark, for now, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who was hoping to retain the trophy he won two years ago at Hazeltine, will dominate an American team that is not quite sure of itself in the morning fourballs and will win the series 3-1.
The US team has shown more resistance in the foursomes and will be able to reduce the differences.
The equipment of Jim Furyk needed to get eight pars in the 12 individual rounds to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to make four birdies in a row, while Molinari, who is known as "Molliwood" after a week of sensational play, is the only other player to have made four birdies in a row in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After the celebrations of the fourballs, Patrick Reed and Tiger Woods will be looking to continue their brilliant form to beat a struggling Woods and debutant American Bryson Dechambeau by five and four.
Woods, who had been drenched in two matches on Saturday, will show flashes of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and in consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who is not going to play in the fourballs in the morning, will play with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and will win by 2 and 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and third best players in the world, respectively.
The European Union has never had so much of a face in a day as pleasant and south-westerly in Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times champion of the tournament, and Justin Thomas set a new reference point for Americans, with two points.
To win a victory with determination over the Espanyol Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and, later, to win the foursomes with Poulter and Rory McIlroy, after having lost the first two matches.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team won after losing the first two matches. The team of Furyk, defending the title, only needs to tie to keep it.
However, after two days, it seems that the counterattack on Sunday is out of his reach.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally "in a capricious manner" if there are signs of confidence.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea will announce on Saturday to the United Nations that the sanctions are intensifying the country's distrust of the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country will not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho will tell the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea has taken "important measures of goodwill" during the past year, including dismantling its nuclear test site and its missile launch pad, and committing to no longer proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
“You’re not going to get a response from the U.S.,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, they will not begin unilateral disarmament in a way that is unilateral.”
If North Korea is going to take up the concerns of South Korea about the resistance of Washington to a phased approach to denuclearization "step by step," it will seem significant because it will not reject the unilateral denuclearization of the United States that it has already rejected in the past.
He will refer to the joint statement that Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump will sign at the first summit between a president of the United States and a leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim is expected to commit to working toward the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," while Trump will promise guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has formally offered to end the Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington also has to resist the pressure to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The United States insists that first the nuclear program must be produced and the level of pressure must be increased in order to achieve their objective in a coercive way, in addition to opposing the "declaration of war", and will ask Ri.
The perception that we will be sanctioned for our actions is a fantasy of the people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the sanctions are continuing to increase our distrust.
It is not going to refer to the plans to celebrate a second inauguration between Kim and Trump who the leader of the United States is going to highlight at the beginning of next week.
In this regard, the minister will highlight three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in in the last five months and will add: "If the party involved in the nuclear issue of North Korea is the Republic of Korea, the denuclearization of the peninsula will not have arrived at this stalemate."
However, the speech that Ri will make will be very different from the one he made last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that launching missiles at the territory of the United States was inevitable after Trump called Kim "Rocket Man" in a failed suicide mission.
Trump, who will be in office in a few days, will destroy completely North Korea, will praise Kim for his fashion sense, but will say that there is still a lot to do and the sanctions will have to be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump will say there were no termini for this and that "it doesn't matter if it's two years, three years or five months."
The Xina and Russia support the UN Security Council to reward Pyongyang for its measures.
The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, will declare on Thursday at the UN Security Council that: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until the complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut off the financing of its missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo is going to find Kim outside the UN General Assembly and then he will go to Pyongyang in the proper month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit is not going to go well.
He will leave Pyongyang in July if he has achieved some goals, but North Korea will accuse him of making "demands that are not in line with a gangster."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has agreed to dismantle a missile testing site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "measures in consonance."
Kim has said that she had communicated that the "measures in consonance" she was seeking were the measures of security that Trump had promised to Singapore, in addition to other actions to normalize relations with Washington.
The students of Harvard have a course on habits of rest.
A new course at Harvard University has allowed students to sleep less, in an attempt to combat the culture, each class lasting longer, encouraged by caffeine.
An academic will observe that the students of the university number u of the world are often careless about basic aspects of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, is designing the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He will be inspired to create a curriculum after having studied the impact of the lack of sound on learning.
At the end of the round, a tired man will say to himself: "Why did I have to do all this, in my last year?"
He said that no one had spoken about the importance of the sound, which will surprise you.
In the course, which is being taught for the first time this year, the students are explained the basic concepts on how to improve their academic and sporting performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and director of the psychiatric services at the University, will say that the University will decide to introduce the course after the students have suffered from a lack of sleep for a week.
The course, of one hour duration, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dormitory, the students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, books and lights to get information about the effects of caffeine and light on sports performance and the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, it is explained that the longer the deprivation of sound, the greater the risk of suffering from hearing loss, brain damage, depression and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons will help you think about your daily route.
We know that the students' behaviour will not change immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as we have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on our health.
The culture of pride in maintaining one's identity all night long still exists, and it will say, and it will add that modern technology and the pressure of the students are making the students who are deprived of sleep a problem that is getting worse every year.
To ensure that you enjoy a good quality of life for a long time, you will need to have a secret weapon, the "silent weapon" of the students, to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety, which will help you avoid taking on too much, as the lack of sound puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes it impossible to concentrate.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physics, will help Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond will say that the course has been opened and that he has been inspired to promote the course on the whole campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask the students of post-graduate studies to develop a similar program before they join the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler will recommend to students that they set an alarm clock when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with the home fans cheering Gerrard
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at home to Livingston, which means another soaking at the hands of the opposition.
Rangers were looking to add to their first victory of the season at home against St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted a second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as manager, leaving the club in 8th place, 8 points behind leaders Hearts.
Menga will score the goal in the 51st minute, and it will seem like the Rangers, who are lacking inspiration, are equal to the score.
While the Rangers are in the second place, the Livingston can take the third position, but the Hibs are ahead of them by goals.
The Rangers could face more difficulties after the break, as the linesman Calum Spence will need medical attention after being hit by an object thrown from the stands.
Gerrard will make eight changes to the team that beat Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, on the other hand, will start with the same eleven that drew with Hearts last week. He will certainly feel satisfied with the way his team, well organized, will suffocate their rivals in every moment.
If the Rangers dominate possession, the Livingston will create more danger when they have the ball.
Of course, they have to play for two minutes, when the first intervention of Menga leaves Scott Pittman ahead of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder will be deflected and will miss the great opportunity.
A powerful shot from Keaghan Jacobs will be enough to beat Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow's defence will only deflect the ball to the post.
The Rangers have the control, but it seems they have more hope than the players in their final game.
Alfredo Morelos thought he would have had a penalty at the 15th minute, as Steven Lawless and Steven Thomson were going head to head, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers will only have to defend two crosses at the first post, but the first post of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, will not have any problems with the cross of Coulibaly and the easy defender Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi match could have been against the clock, no one can deny that he deserves it only for his effort.
Once again, the Rangers can't compete with the hard work of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield will not react when Declan Gallagher passes the ball to Scott Robinson, who will keep his cool to score a simple goal.
Gerrard will make a substitution at the break, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The change will have an immediate impact, as the right-back will make a pass to Morelos, and Kelly will be able to run at the defence.
Although this is not the case, Livingston will continue to attract the attention of the visitors by playing exactly as they like, with long passes from Lithgow and Halkett.
The band of Holt could have won the title, but McGregor will keep fighting Jacobs until he gets a knockdown.
Glenn Middleton, Rangers' substitute, is going to ask for another penalty for a foul with Jacobs, but now Thomson is going to make the big saves.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
I am a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, which is 136 years old and counting... the day on which the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger is going to develop a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that will finally give us the means to know what we are dealing with.
The Geiger counter, which is a pillar of science in the field of radiation, will also become a pillar of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two cowboys apparently broken down:
Home: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find minerals containing radioactivity, like uranium.
When the ear is placed against the ear, it can hear the effects of the radioactivity emitted by the minerals.
Evans: "I'm sure it's great!"
Hans Geiger will die in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the inventor who bears his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer could help the immune system to "see" the cancer cells.
A new vaccine against cancer could help the immune system to see and eliminate cancer cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
It is possible to see a common protein in many cancers and, subsequently, to inject them.
A vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman vaccinated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, will see the disappearance of ovarian cancer, which lasts more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, subsequently, inject them back.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The protein HER2 “favours the growth of various types of cancer”, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar focus to that used to treat cancer patients and “train” their immune cells to attack the cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West is going to wear a MAGA hat on SNL after his performance.
It's not going to end well.
Kanye West will be featured on the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated President Trump, and said he would run for president in 2020.
After his third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat with the slogan "Make America Great Again", he will start to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
Whenever I talk to white people, I ask them: Can you imagine Trump being a racist?
Well, if you are worried about racism, you should have done it a long time ago, you know.
The Saturday Night Live program will start with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star is mocked by Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though he didn't say it, Chris Rock will be pushing the video of West's disapproval of the social networks.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
The public has complained that the players are not being treated well because of the hat that West is wearing.
They are going to attack us.
You don't wear that hat with that cap on.
To win.
I was told that I was in a lower position than I thought, according to the Washington Examiner.
West will continue: "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he puts on the Superman cape so that he can't be told what to do. "Do you want the world to advance?"
Proved to be a good judge of character.
His comments will provoke the ire of the public most of the time, and the members of the program's staff seem to be very angry, according to Variety, which had a reporter who was going to explain to the public: "The study will be completely mutilated."
West is going to carry Ariana Grande's ex, the rapper Mac Miller, who died a few days ago.
The public will be perplexed by the interpretation of the song I Love it, which was sung by a bottle of Perrier.
West will get the award for the conservative group's leader, Candace Turner, who will say: "One of the most valiant spirits: THANK YOU FOR SHINING A LIGHT ON THE MULTITUDE."
But the presenter of the debate program, Karen Hunter, will say that West was "the best who is and who is absolutely marvelous."
But he hasn't rewarded anyone (buying his music or stealing it or giving support to his "art") who adopts and defends an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
We also, will add.
Before the program, the rapper will announce on Twitter that he had already canvassed the name and that he was "the one who was known as Kanye West before."
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, before becoming Snoop Lion and the disappearance of the legend of music Prince, changed his name to a symbol and, later, the artist known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was shot in Belfast on Thursday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Crown Court on Monday.
The police will review the charges.
The star of the game, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for playing the character of Jon Snow in the fantasy medieval violent series of HBO Game of Thrones.
Despite this, the actor, who is 31 years old, has denied the stereotype of the heroic male, saying that these papers often give the impression that young people think they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Kit said that “something was not right” and that he was “questioning how to confront toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.”
Kit, who recently got married to the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that she has the determination to face this problem.
“Personally, I think that we have to ask ourselves what masculinity is,” he said.
“What have you learned from the men who have developed during their development in relation to the problem that they have experienced?”
According to Kit, television can be held responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its characters who are so virile.
What is innate and what is acquired?
What is the point of the television and the racing circuits that make the young people think that they have to have this facet of virility?
It is one of the great questions of our time: how do I get better?
Because something has gone wrong with the young people.
In the interview, he also admits that he would not play a pro-am or a pro-am-pro-am during the final round of the series, but that he is ready for battles and horses.
From November, Kit will be starring in the play True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor is going to reveal soon that knowing his girlfriend Rose is the best thing that has happened to him.
“I’ve met my future wife, so I’ll give her my future family and my life ahead.”
The paper rose is the love of the character that represents Kit, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple will marry in June 2018 at the family farm of Leslie, in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The Xina reports an increase of 14%
The Xina has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people who are HIV positive and with AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only the second quarter of 2018 will declare 40,000 cases.
The vast majority of cases are of sexual transmission, unlike what was happening previously.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly propagated in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
Although, the number of people who contract the HIV virus for this cause has reduced to zero, according to the statements of the Chinese health officials in a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality is decriminalized in Xina in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, the studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who maintain homosexual relationships will marry a woman.
Many of the injuries are caused by lack of precautions in sexual relations.
From 2003, the government of the Xina has promised universal access to medication for HIV as part of an effort to confront the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee of the Senate has leaked data on senators of the Republican Party and has dismantled "dangerous conspiracy theories" and "lies".
Representative of the United States Maxine Waters will denounce on Saturday the accusations according to which a member of her personal staff had published personal information of three Republican senators of the United States on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democratic candidate in Los Angeles will claim that the demands of the critics and the web sites of the extreme right have been met.
“I’m going to think, think and think some more,” Waters said in a statement to Twitter.
However, the information published contained the addresses and phone numbers of the senators from South Carolina Lindsey Graham and Utah Orrin Hatch.
The information will be published on the Senate Judiciary Committee's website on Thursday and will be available for a limited time.
The information will be filtered after three senators question Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState are reporting that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and revealed the identity of a member of Waters' staff.
This complaint is completely false and is a complete lie, Waters will continue.
The member of my personal, the identity, the personal data and the security of the person who has been the victim of these false and fraudulent denunciations, will not be responsible in any way for this information leak.
This complaint is completely false and is only an invention.
The statement by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer will generate criticism in a hurry, including that of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
This is a full of indignation letter, written by Fleischer.
This makes me think that he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of doing something they haven't done, they shouldn't get angry.
No one should show disrespect.
The accused should not be questioned about his motives.
He must keep his calm and his composure.
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who the critics are accusing of seeming angry during the session on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republican Party, is also present to challenge Waters in the midterm elections, and he will also express his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s important if you’re sure.”
According to Waters, his office had alerted the authorities and the security forces of these fraudulent declarations.
“We will ensure that the guilty are revealed, and that they will continue, and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions that they have committed and that they have caused damage to all and each of the members of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again: parody of a limited spy by Rowan Atkinson
It is a tradition to refer to the Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this re-release of the Johnny English franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and will continue in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous auto-satire about the lack of men’s toilets will be a new opportunity for export?
In any case, the incompetent driver of the black car and the face of rubber Johnny English can renew his license for a second time to drive it again. His name indicates more than that he is a comic creation designed for a territory of English-speaking countries.
It is obvious that it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare glamor, has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pair of shoes that adds a single note to the theme of Cars at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the international version and the mysterious Atkinson who represented the forgotten ads on Barclaycard TV, which were causing chaos.
There are two good moments in this last trip to JE.
I would have loved the Johnny English who would sleep in a medieval armour and the blades of the helicopter would cut him.
He wants the actor who played Atkinson in the comedy film, but the humor seems to be quite fluid and unnecessary, especially since serious films like 007 and Mission Impossible already include it.
The humour seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as funny or as well-written as the gags of Mr. Bean, who represents Atkinson.
The premise that is repeated often is that Great Britain is in serious problems.
A pirate informatic has infiltrated the network of British spies and revealed the identities of all the British agents on the ground, which causes consternation for the agent in charge, a paper sadly lacking in Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and over-rated figure, who has already suffered a total collapse of popularity in political terms: Emma Thompson gives the best of her in this role, but the script does not go any further.
His intelligence officers inform him that, if any of the spies is caught, he will not be able to retire.
This includes the maldestro Johnny English, who is employed as a professor in some luxury institution, but also teaches classes on how to be a spy, with some good gags, and when English offers an academy of espionage that seems like a rock school.
English has returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his pilot, Ben Miller, who is to represent him again.
Bough is a home boy, attached to a submarine, a paper enthusiast, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, who are the best at what they do, are called in to help Sa Majestat, the King, when the secret service is in trouble. They find themselves in the company of Olga Kurylenko, the spectacular “femme fatale” Ophelia Bulletova.
However, the prime minister is under threat from the charismatic billionaire technologist who claims he can solve the problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their ridiculous odyssey of ridiculous lies: dressed in clown costumes, they set fire to a French restaurant, they cause chaos by stealing a luxury yacht and they cause a great confusion by trying to use a reality virtual to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All the parades have certainly come to an end in this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and the smoothness that it presents, it seems like a children's program.
Things are pretty normal.
With the other films in the Johnny English series, it has been helpful to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is proposing a four-day week, but it is proposing a five-day week with a 35-hour working week.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical change in order to work four days a week and earn five.
However, the companies that adopt the technology will be able to get more work done with fewer employees, and the workers will have more time to enjoy themselves.
The employees will enjoy a week of three days off, but they will still have to work the same amount of hours.
According to the plan, the idea would fit in with the economic agenda of the party and the plans to incline the country in favour of the workers.
The change to a four-day week will be supported by the Trades Union Congress, which has a method of allowing workers to take advantage of the economic benefits.
An experienced Labour Party member has told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that the party will announce a review of its policy before the end of the year.
It will not be at night, but a week of four days is a working week that fits in with the perspective of the game to balance the economy in favour of the worker and in the general industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Partit Verde has promised a week of four-day working during the campaign for the general elections of 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration at present.
According to a statement by the Partit Laborista: "A week's work is not political and the party is not political."
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell will use the party conference next week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell will show his determination to restore the power of the anonymous directors and the speculators to the public services.
The plans of the minister also include that the shareholders of the companies of high-altitude water could not recover all the investment, since the socialist government could apply "deductions" for the crimes that have been committed.
He also confirmed plans to create a fund to buy shares in private companies and to give employees 10% of the shares in the companies in the sector, which they hope will be worth £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change his opinion.
The FBI investigation of the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's discoveries could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley will ask Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could have changed their opinion of the president.
Kennedy showed more openness than his South Carolina colleague.
I'm being serious, I said Kennedy.
I told the judge that I had spoken with Kavanaugh.
I've been tricking him all along and I've asked him if he's done it.
He showed great determination and was determined to win.
However, Graham's vote seems to be very important.
I have the opinion that Brett Kavanaugh is guilty and I would present an explosive accusation.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett Kavanaugh is going to deny it, absolutely.”
I'm afraid that no one will be able to verify this.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see that I need to change anything."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it helped to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, which presents a program of stars absolutely impressive, which ends a mission equally impressive: eradicate poverty in the world.
In the 2019 edition, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn to celebrate the work of global leaders and artists, including Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the global goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which will start in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international organizations that aims to end poverty by 2030, by increasing the number of people who help to combat it.
To get a free entry to the event (if anyone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistants have to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a prank phone call or any other activity to wake up people's awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What is the Global Citizen Challenge and what is the goal?
The idea of rewarding the people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to shout out or simply to demand a bit more of what we call "clictivism" (people who think that making a difference is signing a petition online or sending a tweet)
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who have helped to address various issues.
He said that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and political commitments equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group will have committed to 390 commitments and derivatives of its actions, of which 10,000 million USD have already been recovered or recaptured.
The group estimates that the protected areas have a direct impact on 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a foundation that invests in entrepreneurs and innovators in the UK and Rwanda, which is committed to "help children grow as much as possible" and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thank you to the support of the United Kingdom Government, the national governments and the Global Citizens, like yourselves, who can turn the injustice of malnutrition into a page in the history of humanity,” said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group will also explain that after more than 5,000 actions they have asked the British government to improve the nutrition of children and mothers, the government will announce the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million children and infants with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F of your website who asked "what do you think that can end up with extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult path. Sometimes we will fall and get up again.
But with the great movements of defense of the civil rights and against apartheid, we will triumph, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at the event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blockade" to obstruct the export of Russian energy (Secretary of Interior)
Washington Post: "If it's necessary, we have to go to the Russian embassy in Washington to prevent the Russian energy from hitting the markets, including the markets of the Orient, such as the one in Mitjà, according to the Secretary of the Interior of the United States, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that the Russian intervention in Syria, mainly, is operating with the invitation of the legitimate government, and it is a pretext to explore our energy markets.
“The motive for the movement is the desire to negotiate with the energy, as it is already happening in the East of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to face this question.
The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to guarantee that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block, to prevent the energy from entering the market.
Zinke was addressing the audience at the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without any ties to the energy industry that calls itself the "voice of the consumer of energy" in the United States.
Compare the strategies of Washington in negotiating with Russia and Iran, and you will see that they are the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia consists of using more or less of these fuels, but in any case substituting them,” he said, while indicating that Russia only has a reserve, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The declarations arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, in place of Russian gas, the most economical option for European consumers.
With this final goal, the officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to drop the Nord Stream 2 project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin "captive" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely economic.
The Kremlin argues that the opposition's fierce opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of good governance.
I think that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of pressure, and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers, and that is what the Energy Minister of Russia, Alexander Novak, said after a meeting with the Secretary of the US Department of Energy Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The posture of the United States has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization of the German industry, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to separate the EU energy policy from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy policy," Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren has said she will "think about" running for president in 2020.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren is expected to announce her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirms that she would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to take over Washington and fix the fracture in the government,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)
“After the 6th of November, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.”
Warren will intervene on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and will say that "he was leading the country in the wrong direction."
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Thursday, Warren will say: "It's clear that the FBI investigation will be over before the elections."
A survey that was published yesterday shows that a majority of Warren's voters believe she will not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of likely Massachusetts voters say the senator should not run for president, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
A thirty-two percent support the candidacy.
The poll will reveal a much wider support for the candidacy of former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other names of the Democrats who are going to be considered for the 2020 nomination include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden will say that he will reveal his decision officially to the president, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites the affected for TEPT Track Palin at the meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) will spend a year in Iraq after being called up for active duty on September 11, 2007.
On Monday night, they will arrest and charge the man for domestic violence.
“When my son comes home, he can understand other families that have been affected by TEPT and some of the emotional scars that return when our soldiers return home,” he will explain to the public at a meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
The elephant will be named "the elephant in the room" and he will say the following to his son and other veterans of war: "Make it a little different, make it a little tougher, ask yourself if you have respect for those who fought for you and for your fellow soldiers, as well as for any other member of the armed forces."
The man arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and weapons charges, is being held without bail.
18 states and the District of Columbia have joined the challenge to a new policy on asylum.
The District of Columbia and the State of Columbia have joined the legal challenge to a new policy of the United States that denies asylum to victims who flee domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia will present an amicus curiae brief on Friday in Washington to argue for a man who challenged the Trump administration's policy on asylum seekers.
The full name of the request of the case Grace vs Sessions that the United States will present in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.
You can say that the members of the violent band "and the fills" are going to attack her, but the American officials are going to deny her request for asylum on July 20.
We need to stop Texas.
The advocates of the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are many applicants for asylum to the United States, as countries that face general problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new policy of the US government to revoke a decision of 2014 of the Board of Appeals of Immigration, which allowed undocumented immigrants to seek asylum from domestic violence.
The District of Columbia's general prosecutor, Karl Racine, will declare on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
Federal law requires that asylum seekers be adjudicated on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the individual's claim, and this prohibition infringes on the right to asylum.
The advocates also argue that the policy that denies entry to immigrants is bad for the economy of the United States, since it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is more likely that it is
In June, the US Attorney General Jeff Sessions will order the judges of the immigration courts to deny asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
The asylum is available for those who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion.
The asylum has the power to solve all the problems, not just the most serious ones, but also those that people face every day.
Efforts to rescue the survivors of the Palu disaster are multiplying as the number of human losses increases.
For the survivors, the situation is getting more desperate by the minute.
The atmosphere is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, 35, as she calmly watched her son with a fever in a hospital in the city of Palu that had been destroyed by the earthquake.
Every minute, an ambulance carries someone who has been injured.
There is no potable water."
Residents have been seen trying to salvage what they can from their flooded homes.
There are hundreds of thousands of victims, and the hospitals are full of people with serious injuries.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his leg, have been discharged from the military hospital in Palu, as the patients are being discharged because of the strong aftershocks that are continuing.
The police denied the man's claim that he had been attacked by a group of men while explaining how the explosion had destroyed the fifth floor of the hotel, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.”
He was trapped in the ruins of the house, he says, and he will explain to Associated Press that his family had witnessed a wedding in the village.
“I felt my wife’s hand on my shoulder, and then I felt her hand no longer on my shoulder.”
I don't know what happened to her and to my daughter.
I hope you have a good game.
The US ambassador to the EU accuses China of "propaganda announcements".
A week later, a Chinese official publication in a North American newspaper published an advertisement of four pages promoting the advantages of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the newspaper to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump is scheduled to address the Des Moines Register on Wednesday, the most influential newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 US elections, which China denies.
The accusation by Trump that Beijing is interfering in the US elections will mark a new phase in the US campaign to intensify pressure on China.
It is normal for the governments of foreign countries to insert advertisements for their products in order to promote their commerce, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and that has put pressure on the import and export of goods.
The aranzels of the Xina were broken by the war of commercial principal of the war of the states, as Iowa, that gave support to the Republicà of Trump, according to experts xinesos and north-americans.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, said that Beijing has hurt the workers, farmers and businesses in the US.
China, Branstad is going to write an article for The Des Moines Register about the publication of propaganda ads in our free newspaper.
In order to promote the campaign, the governor uses the respected tradition of free speech and the press in the United States to insert an advertisement for payment in The Des Moines Register.
In China, where there are many differences in opinion and no one can see the real opinions of the Chinese citizens on the economic trajectory of the country, until the means of communication are dominated by the Communist Party of China.
One of the most prominent journalists of the Xina newspaper refused to publish the article, but he did not say the name of the newspaper.
The Republicans are the voters of women before the midterm elections with the disaster of Kavanaugh, warn the analysts.
With many of the country’s leading Republicans supporting and defending Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that the Democrats are likely to suffer a backlash in the midterm elections.
The emotions that surround this case are extremely high and the majority of the Republicans have already shown that they want to make a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be explained", explains Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that will be published on Saturday.
Reed will say that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to end the FBI investigation is sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not be silenced today, or tomorrow, or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, on Thursday, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday, the Protestants cry "November is coming!" (November is coming!) while the Republicans are demonstrating in the Senate lobby while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decide to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of the Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be outside the graphic,
The people who have already been here are all right; it's certain.
But we could have had more, especially among the voters of women and voters under 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
After the testimony of the witness in public, Ford detailed her requests for sexual assault against Kavanaugh, the analysts suggested that it could produce a negative response if the Republicans pressured.
“This has become a political embolism for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
It is not only about the vote of the Senate or the final vote. It is also about how the Republicans have managed this issue and how they have treated her.
The Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford testimony and those who believe in Kavanaugh, and the balance that is tipping towards the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of the respondents believe Ford's testimony to be absolutely or probably true, while 35% believe Kavanaugh's testimony to be absolutely or probably true.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had lied under oath, while 30 percent said they believed Ford.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is investigating the requests for Ford and, at the very least, another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week under oath that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when they were both 17 years old.
Ramirez is going to show us his genitals at a party while he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to sort their data and only certain people can access it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that the hidden intention of Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
“I have to do it myself,” he said of the emerging company.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid platform to allow users to create their own "personal data room" or a POD.
To contain lists of contacts, lists of tasks pending, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional information.
It's like the Google Drive, the Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They are all available in a browser now.
The user who is the only one with access to the data in the personal data area is the one who decides who can access the information.
The company calls itself "empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company’s delegate, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills to make the platform Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a platform for security acquired by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, developers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the decentralized applications available at the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee will say that none of his team is talking about "Facebook and Google about introducing a radical change to all business models being built completely during the night.
“We are not asking for permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the “mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee will transform the Internet when he founds the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The last two months, Berners-Lee has been a key figure in the debate over the neutrality of the network.
During the Inrupt launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee is "incredibly optimistic" about the future of the web.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Creu Victòria de la I GM
The only cleric of the Church of England who will be canonized during the First World War has been honored by his city 100 years after his death.
The colonel and reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he will be shot down four days later and will not know that he has won the highest military honor of Britain.
The two of them will unveil a commemorative plaque on Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, will say that it was "magnificent" that the stone was presented exactly 100 years after the plane crash guarded by him.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann will command the 1st Battalion through a thick fog and under heavy artillery and machine gun fire.
Later, he will run to the line and, with the greatest courage, he will push the line ahead of him before jumping over a single hurdle with only one foot and leaving three members of the team in a state of shock.
The colonel will be shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) will say that the actions of his father and mother are a project that can never be equaled, which produces a feeling of humility.
And the two of them, Dr. James Vann and his son, will also be leaving a crown after the parade, directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann will say that he felt very honored to be part of the parade and will add that the true hero is one who supports his fellow man.
The fans of MMA who are going to stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, will see Peppa Pig in their location.
Imagine that we stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and that we missed the most important event.
The San Jose cartell contained 13 lights, including six of the main target, and had to be seen live all night on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing for the fight, the spectators of the Kingdom of Great Britain will be astonished when the programming will change to Peppa Pig.
Some are disgusted to have to stay up all night to see the fight.
A Twitter follower will describe the changes in the drawings as "a man vomiting blood".
The government has decided that the program is not appropriate, so they are going to change it to a children's program.
Peppa the pig, yes.
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, will say that they will work to include the spectators of the United Kingdom in the future.
“When I think about repetition, I think I can do it,” Coker said.
But we can't play all day on a Sunday, we have to finish by Monday morning.
But we are working.
I'm sorry, when I changed channel, there were many messages that came in and I didn't read all of them, and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to resolve the problem, but we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government problem.
We promise that he won't pass again.
They will leave in five lights, instead of six normally. They will try to make it show for the spectators, but it will end.
It's a bad situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he has felt inferior to the rest of the world because of his sexuality, but that it will give him the motivation to win.
The 24-year-old athlete has declared that he will not stop until he has finished secondary school, which he has never done.
On the Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, Lauren Laverne was talking about the rights of gay people to give hope to others.
He will also say that the importance of golfing the Olympics has been restored.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, has been off sick for several months with a serious illness.
Daley, who is going to appear on the first episode of Laverne, will say that he felt "less than" the others because "it was not socially acceptable for children and children".
The following day, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph.
He wanted to prove that there was "something", I mean, not to deceive anyone about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist in the 400 meters, who is a promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image to promote the Commonwealth Games in Australia, is asking more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was lucky to be able to live openly without any ramifications and wanted to give hope to other people.
The world's top golfer, Tiger Woods, is going to explain that he fell in love with a man, the American director Dustin Lance Black, who is going to meet him in 2013, "and he's going to surprise him".
Last year, Daley will marry the Oscar winner, who is 20 meters taller than he is, but he says that the difference in age has never been a problem.
According to him, when you are young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The pair will be partners in June of this year, when Robert Ray Black-Daley will be inducted.
If I had asked you last year, all that was needed was to win an Olympic gold medal.
There are things more important than the Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is the Robbie.
His son is just like his father, Robert, who is going to die at the age of 40, because of a brain tumor.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was if he had the tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the first row.
“I couldn’t say to him “stop, you won’t be able to occupy the first row”, he’d say.
While he was holding her, he would stop breathing and she would not be alive any longer, that is why I finally accepted that he was not invincible.
Next year, Daley will compete in the 2012 Olympics and will win the bronze.
He knew that was what I had been doing all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in the Olympics. There was no better feeling.
It will also inspire the first song of the album (Proud by Heather Small), which accompanied the preparation for the Olympics and which still gives me goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Saturday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson will be present at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The North American Phil Mickelson will break a record by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to change his physical state if he wants to avoid a disappointing finish.
Mickelson, who will be playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, will be presented by captain Jim Furyk for the “fourballs” and “foursomes” on Saturday.
In place of being at the center of the action, as has been the case in the United States, the tournament director of the five major tournaments divides his time between being an announcer and working on his game at the course, with the hope of correcting what is wrong.
He has not hit the most direct drives, nor has he been so solid at the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the rough punishes the wayward shots.
If his own trajectory is not as good as Mickelson's, he will face the precise champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans start the 12 individual matches strongly, the match of Mickelson could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk will express confidence in this home, without being able to say much more.
“I’m going to play my role perfectly on that day, I’m going to hit a little punch shot and I’m going to hit it with my left arm while I’m going to be prepared for the end.”
You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
He is a star of the game and has contributed a lot to these clubs in the past and this week.
Probably, I didn't imagine playing two games.
I imagined it more, but I imagined it like this and I imagined it like that, and we have to advance.
He will be here, as always.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break the record of Nick Faldo for the most Ryder Cup matches played.
To mean the final of a Ryder Cup that has not equaled the individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 tournaments, 20 defeats and 7 ties, all of which Furyk has said that his presence has brought intangible benefits to the team.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke around and he’s a great companion for the team,” he explained.
“I think that the younger players also enjoy this week, which has been fun to watch.”
Adds much to the band of his game.
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows that starting with a considerable advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The American team will start the year 1997 at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they will win by 14.5-13.5.
“And remember that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, and we will lose, but at Valderrama, we will win, but for a few”, he said, after the image, after seeing the victory of the team of 2018 by 5-3 on Friday, and the victory of the team of 2019 by 10-6 on Saturday.
The story has taught me and all the members of the team that we haven't finished yet.
We have to go all the way.
You have to get out and do it all.
That doesn't end until the putts don't go in.
We have an objective, to try to win the trophy, and we have to keep our concentration to do it.
Yes, I have said it, in the 12 players that we have in the team, but also I have present here some of our rivals: the best players in the world.
Impressed with the way his players have performed in a demanding golf course, Bjorn has said: "I won't rush into it."
Tomorrow will be different.
The individual score will make the difference and will decide the outcome.
It's fantastic to be there with a company, but the individual duels put to the test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you must send to the other players, to tell them the best score you made today.
At this moment, you leave your company and he will also leave and take the best of himself.
In opposition to Bjorn, the captain rival, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will add three points.
Furyk knows all about the money on the last day, as he will be part of the winning team at Brookline before losing in the “Miracle of Medinah” that will win Europe.
“I remember all the words,” he said in response to the question about how he would motivate his players, the day before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we want to start with a good score, like at Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, there is a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We have prepared the team in accordance with the circumstances and the best way to make the most of the opportunity.
Thomas has the chance to try to start a comeback against Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the first match of the European Tour.
“I tried this order because I think I can cover all the possibilities,” said Bjorn on his selection for the individual matches.
The new warplane of Germany, postponed again
The new German battleship will be ready for action in 2014, but it will not replace the warships of the Cold War era, but it will not be able to do so until the end of the year, when the systems are defective and the cost is increasing, according to local sources.
The finalization of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new class of Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military port.
The ship will be ready to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that have arisen since the construction have put the finishing touches on this ambitious project.
The four ships of the class Baden-Württemberg that the Navy will be replacing in 2007 will be the old frigates of the class Bremen.
It is believed that it will include a potent cannon, a set of missiles and anti-missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions, such as a radar reduced, infrared, acoustic signatures and signatures.
Other characteristics to be highlighted include longer maintenance periods: it would be possible to use the new clubs for two years without having to pass through national ports.
These idiots, who are always in front of the pack, who are supposed to be the future of German football, will be obsolete when the new generation comes in.
The unfortunate F125 is going to be news next year, when the German Navy will take the vessel back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a vessel to the shipyard in one piece.
There are few details known about the engines of the aircraft, but the German media have cited various "material and technical defects" of the aircraft that would make it unusable in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, as approximately 120 sailors, the majority of the crew of the old frigates of class Bremen, or operate in the class Baden-Württemberg.
In addition, it has been discovered that the weight of the vessel is excessive, which means that the ship's capacity is limited and future improvements will be more difficult.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as much as the German ships that were used during the Second World War.
The defective materials, the cost of the project, which also included the training of the crew, also started to cause problems.
It is believed that he has arrived at a surprising 3.100 million euros (3.600 million dollars) from a starting point of 2.200 million euros.
The problems of the new missiles have become a special problem, if we take into account the recent warnings that indicate that the military power of Germany is weakening.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Defence Committee, has said that the German Navy "can't do anything with the ships it has".
The official has said that the situation has worsened with the time because they are going to stop using the helicopters, but they are not going to provide any more helicopters.
He lamented that the Baden-Württemberg team can't join the German Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of the rats.
A new investigation into a farm in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to discover how the rats are using the landscape to feed themselves.
It is hoped that the new discoveries will provide new data on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The scientists at the National Science Foundation in Scotland will continue to study the soprano and common birds, as well as the northern birds and waterfowl at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
They will install special recording devices in the property to monitor the activities of the rats during the season.
Volunteers and staff of the National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with detectors.
The analysis of the sound recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, we will create a report and a map of the habitat to create a detailed image of the player's behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation officer for the Scottish Wildlife Trust, hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important for the birds and how they use each species.
This information will help to determine the advantages of the management of the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and to improve the maintenance of the woods for the benefit of the birds and other associated species.
The population of rats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration of buildings threaten the birds and animals, as they can cause the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and the lighting also pose a risk, just like the pesticides and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as the attacks by domestic cats.
In reality, the caddies are not caddies.
Because of his nocturnal habits of hunting, his ears are more useful than the ears of the others when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of localisation to locate insects and obstacles that get in the way of their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taking the matter very seriously.
Experts have the appropriate training, which includes tests, inspections of the course and, occasionally, rescues.
The first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to the recovery of the Scottish crossbill, which is the only crossbill species found in Dumfries and Galloway, the two counties of the Scottish crossbill.
The administrator of the estate, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Threave, we have a great area for the rats.”
“We have many old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.”
However, we will still have to take into account many aspects of the ratpenats, so that the work that is being done here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to create.
It is important to check if there have been any ratpenats before starting to make maintenance work on the property, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of a newborn rat could kill more than 400 females and young, which could mean the disappearance of the whole local population.
The rats are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, molest or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, official of the Scottish Wildlife Trust, has encouraged the public to go a step further to help.
He said: "We still have to learn a lot about the rats and, in the case of some of our species, we have no data on their population."
Ronaldo denies the accusations of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the accusations of rape against him are "false news" and has said that the people who want to become famous will do so thanks to his name.
The lawyers of the accused will demand the German weekly Der Spiegel to withdraw the accusations.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping a woman from the United States, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room of a hotel in Las Vegas in the year 2009.
Presumably, you will pay $375,000 because the incident is not public, in accordance with the information published on Thursday by Der Spiegel.
In a video on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, who has 142 million followers, will say that the allegations were false.
No, no, no, no, no.
The man who said that today, false news, has won the Pilota d'or five times.
“I would like to be famous thanks to my name.”
It's normal.
I'm not famous for my name, but it's part of my game.
A happy home and everything is in order,” he added, smiling.
The lawyers of Ronaldo are preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have qualified as "unacceptable information about private life", in agreement with Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "damages equivalent to the value of the loss, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident is supposed to take place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After getting to know each other in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where, according to the reports, Ronaldo raped Mayorga anally, according to the reports.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo will apologize after the incident and will tell him that it was a 99% good thing, except for a 1%.
The documents support that Ronaldo will confirm that he had sexual relations with both women, but they were consensual.
Mayorga also says that she will go to the police and have her injuries photographed at the hospital, but she will accept a deal outside the courts because she had "fear of reprisals" and was worried about being "humiliated publicly".
The woman, 34 years old, says she wants to annul the agreement, since she is still traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United in the summer and has now joined Juventus, the Italian giants, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will lose car manufacturers.
The United Kingdom will always be a great place to do business, said Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
He added that it was "disconcerting" that the base of Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that, if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Auris and Avensis models for Toyota, will produce 150,000 cars this year, of which 90% will be exported to the rest of Europe.
“My view is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal in March, it will be impossible to continue production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, director of operations at Toyota Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without an agreement on how to trade with the rest of the EU has woken up other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW will shut down its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after the Brexit.
The main concerns are related to the fact that the manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in case of Brexit without an agreement.
The production line of Toyota is realitza in a base "just in time", with fish that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on March 29, it is possible that there will be disturbances at the border, which the sector considers could cause delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and this would cause production to slow down.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for Brexit is "precisely calibrated to avoid those border controls".
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that allows us to enjoy the current exit, but also to take advantage of this opportunity.”
“The proofs are not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, that they need to be able to continue with a chain of production.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long the production will last, but in the long term, it has warned that the costs will have to be reduced to remain competitive and the loss of jobs could be inevitable.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the plant coordinator for Unite the Union, said: “The members are very worried about the situation. We have experience of losing these jobs and they don’t come back.”
A portavent of the government has said the following: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could end up being a disaster.
The expected meeting between Donald Trump and the US Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, could be postponed for a week while the fight over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court continues.
Robert Mueller, the special counsel, is supervising the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, the links between Russia and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump fires the special prosecutor or the special prosecutor refuses to sign off on the report, it will feed the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But the rumors that he was about to resign were true.
He's going to announce today that he's going to meet with Trump, who was in the United States in New York.
Trump has said he would prefer not to, but he is postponing the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Kavanaugh and one of the women who is going to accuse him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump will order the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which will end up costing him more votes in the Senate.
The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, will appear on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he will answer the following: "We haven't yet fixed a date, it could be this week, or it could be that it will take another week for all the assumptions to be made.
But I can already see it. I always like to keep up with the news.
Some journalists could refute this assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace will ask why.
Sanders will say that the lack of sessions was because he didn't like the fanfare of the journalists, and he will say: "I won't deny that we are fanfarers."
If that's true, it would mean that the contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president has more sessions of questions and answers than the previous president,” he will say, before adding, without citing any source: “We have consulted these data.”
Sanders said that the sessions would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking with me."
We have tried to do it, but we have not succeeded. We will have to replace the informative sessions with meetings with the President of the United States.
Trump responds to questions about the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignity.
The news of the day is not frequent.
This week, in New York, the president has shown why, after a brief informal appearance and in some moments, he was distant from the journalists gathered.
The Secretary of State for Health wrote to the workers of the National Health Service in Scotland about the fears of the Brexit.
The Secretary of Health of Scotland has written to the staff of the EU who work on health matters in Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and to ask that the work continues after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, member of the Scottish Parliament, will send a letter to the UK government within six months of the UK leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of the applications of EU citizens working in public services.
On his card, Freeman writes the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and it seems that the decisions expected at this late hour are approaching.
However, the British government has also begun preparations in case of a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know that these are difficult times for all of you.
For that, I would like to reiterate that I appreciate very much the contribution of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The companies of the EU and those of the rest of the world, and especially those of our country, contribute a valuable experience and skills that will strengthen and improve the health service, while benefiting patients and communities.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering a knee injury.
Christian Abercrombie, a reserve of the Tennessee State Tigers, has been hospitalized after suffering a knee injury during the loss to Vanderbilt on Saturday, according to Mike Organ, of the Tennessean.
The coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, has told the press that the injury will be produced before the middle of the season.
“He’s going to come to the line and he’s going to drop it,” Reed says.
The trainers and medical staff will give oxygen to Abercrombie before placing him in a litter and carrying him to the hospital to make sure he is breathing.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said that "we still don't have any information about the type or the amount of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury will be produced.
It is the first season of Abercrombie, from second, with Tennessee State after coming from Illinois.
He had completed five of the six par-3s before abandoning the match, which is a total of 18 this season.
Foreigners have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK.
The foreigners who buy property in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp duty than the locals, and the extra money will be used to help people who are unable to afford to buy a home.
This action will neutralize the exit of Corbyn for young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will be applied to those persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
He hopes to earn 120 million euros a year to help the people who don't have a job.
It is expected that the cost of a stamp will rise for non-UK residents buying a property in the UK and that the proceeds will be used to help people who are homeless, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the exit of Jeremy Corbyn from the movement of young voters with promises of providing more affordable housing that would affect the rents more.
The increase in the stamp duty will be levied on those persons and companies who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom; these funds will be used to combat tax evasion.
The over-the-counter, which will be added to the stamp duty rate currently in force, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in second homes and speculation in real estate, could be as high as 3%.
He hopes to earn 120 million euros a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are owned by non-British residents, which increases the prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up the scale of properties.
Many areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure above the set of holes after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the tax on golf balls to help young people to keep their first ball.
You will accuse the big construction companies of keeping the prices of the properties they buy very high and not using them, and you will ask May to annul the quotes for affordable prices so that the "immobiliarial disaster" of Great Britain can be corrected.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including controls on the rental market and the finalization of the “without guilt” desnonaments.
Also, the municipalities will have more power to build new golf courses.
I have said that last year I promised to restore the British sleep: life must get better for each new generation.
I want to correct the current situation in the real estate market.
The Great Britain will always be open to all who wish to live, work and create a life here.
And if you are not correct, then it is just as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as for businesses and their employees who work abroad, to buy property in comparison with British residents who work.
For many people, the dream of owning a house is still far away and the indignity of not having a house is still more real.
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to coach Scotland."
The coach of Sunderland, Jack Ross, has said that his "maximum ambition" is to be the coach of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot has accepted the job of manager of the north-east club, which currently occupies third place in the League One, three points behind the leader.
We will arrive at the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren were promoted to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.”
He said: "I've been playing for 20 years and I've never seen a player win a tournament with a score like that."
“But I have been playing golf in Scotland for a long time and it is always a step back in time.”
This opportunity will only come to me if I have the time to practice with clubs, but”.
The predecessors of Ross in the job of coach of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The ex-manager of Alloa Athletic says he is not under any pressure to be the next in a list of names to be inducted into a team as great as this, after having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my criterion for measuring my exit will be whether I can get the Premier League team back up.”
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is obvious that their place is in the Premier League.
“It’s not easy to get here, but I only consider it possible if I can get back to the club.”
He has only been with the coach for three years, after a period with a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months with the technical director of Hearts.
He will help the Alloa to avoid relegation and will transform St Mirren into champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical shirts than he did in the Dundee United shirt.
“It’s going to be a decisive moment,” he said about accepting the penalty at Alloa.
“I always thought that training was the most important thing, more than playing.
I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you have to overcome each week.
I know that I am under pressure and that I have to perform well, but I feel good as a coach.
I have always wanted to train and I have been doing it, and this time I feel more comfortable than ever before.

The heat wave of summer has disappeared in the bars of Great Britain, but it has put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The bars and the bars have obtained an increase of 2.7% in the sales of the month of July, but the consumption in the restaurants has reduced in a 4.8%, according to the statistics.
Peter Martin, from the financial advisory CGA, the company that has collected the data, says the following: "The continuous hours of sunshine and the participation of England in the World Cup, which has extended more than expected, have made July follow the June pattern, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except for restaurants, which have suffered more.
The 1.8% reduction in the consumption of restaurants in June has increased in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of tapas, have obtained the best results, while the consumption of restaurants has been at a low.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the heat, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that the people only want to go out and have fun.
The bars and taverns that we have consulted, the sales of houses have increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sales of food have decreased by 3%.”
Paul Newman, from the hotel and restaurant consultancy RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April."
The time and the impact of great social and sporting events or the external factors are the main factors related to the sales of the external market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease of 4.8% in sales over the last year would be particularly damaging, more than the continuous pressure from costs.
This summer has been so long and hot that we could not have arrived at a better moment to eat and the shops that serve food will tell us if the temperatures are more moderate than we have had in August.
The total sales of bars and restaurants, including the recent openings, have increased by 2.7% in July, which indicates the increase in the presentation of brands.
The indicator of sales of the sector The Coffer Peach Tracker for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom, collects and analyzes data from 47 operators, with a combined loss of more than 9 million pounds and is the reference point established for the sector.
Each of the five children has a secret account on social networks that can be used to cheat.
Some of the children, aged 11 or 12, have secret accounts on social networks that threaten their parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey among 20,000 secondary school students has indicated an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages.
The news has created fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of the students say they have a "main" account that they show to their peers.
Some of the children, aged 11 or 12, think that social networks are a threat to adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has indicated a rapid increase in the number of false accounts on Instagram, a reference to the photo-sharing site.
The news has created fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of the students say they have a "principal" account that shows only the pairs, while they also have a "private" account.
A woman who discovers the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter will see a message from another girl who wants to "violate" her.
The investigation, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, of which the majority have admitted to having private accounts.
The captain of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, has declared the following: "It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create spaces in cyberspace and the teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been named the new director of the executive committee of the Scottish Athletics Federation at the annual general meeting.
Doyle is the athlete with the most medals in Scotland and on the track and Ian Beattie, the president of Scottish Athletics, will describe this as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at international level in the last decade.
“The respect of the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, we are sure that the athletics of Scotland will benefit from her inclusion in the executive committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle has said the following: "I have many opportunities to act as a witness for the athletes and I hope to be able to help the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who will win the gold in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and who will win four Olympic gold medals and is now a commentator for the BBC, will be unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.

He was exhausted, but I recovered all of it, I'm going to do some agility exercises today!
Thanks for the messages of encouragement!”
A golf ball ad that compares the balls with horses divided the opinion on the Internet.
A company of milkmaids has divided the opinion of the Internet by comparing the milk of cows with that of mares.
To mark the shot of the player considered to be the "silentest shot in the world", the technology company for consumers Elvie has released an ad inspired by a music video for a joke to show the freedom that the new shot gives women.
Four mares are running in a large pasture and are grazing at the rhythm of a song that includes the letters "Si, I love my mare, but you won't see her" and "If you don't have a mare, you're not a man, but a gelding."
The tournament continues: "Bombeja, bombeja, feed the fish, bombeja, bombeja, drown the fish."
The announcement, published on the Facebook page of the company, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and 1000 comments, the video has broken a record for reactions, with many of the comments saying that it shows the horrors of the industry.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to announce the product.”
With us, they will be embarrassed and ashamed to produce milk, and the difference is that they are not as good as our swimmers, who can produce milk only a few days after giving birth.
The tirallet Elvie is hidden in a lactation support (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: "Completely understandable for the mare and the swimmer."
But why not use them to announce a hole-in-one for those who did not lose their balls?
Another user is going to add: "It's an ad out of place."
Other people are defending the announcement; a woman admits that she found the song "funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.”
If you had already given birth, you would have to breastfeed.
The bomb is thrown into the hole with the feeling that it is a cow.
The announcement is a bit of a joke, but you have to take it as it is.
It's a great product”, writes a user.
Another person will comment the following: "It's a funny ad aimed at people who like to shoot with a shotgun (normally at their workplace or the toilet and feel like they're in heaven.
It is not an advertisement that the judge of the industry is a lawyer.
At the end of the video, they show that they have hit all the balls with the driver, discreetly.
The concept that is being promoted is based on the perception that many people feel like they are cheating when they use the driver.
The silence of the electric motor is completely silent, it does not have a cable or a tube and it is discreetly placed in a lactancy support, which gives more freedom to women for a longer time, to swim, to dive and, finally, to get out of the water.
Ana Balarin, Mother's first-team soccer coach and developer of the Mother app, said: "The Elvie Tirallet is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a daring and provocative campaign.
In order to show the relationship between the two, we have chosen to use a tirallet and the strokes that it implies, in order to demonstrate how it is possible to achieve a greater feeling of freedom with the new tirallet.
It's not the first time Elvie has made the news.
During London Fashion Week, two girls will appear on the catwalk for the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children, silently transported to a camp on the Texas border
The number of children emigrating has increased even though the monthly entries through the border have remained stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and the political measures introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to support children.
Traditionally, most sponsors are immigrants who have taken the risk of staying in the country if they are willing to take in a child.
The risk has increased in June, when the federal authorities announce that the possible sponsors and the rest of the adults who have been invited to send digital files, that they will share with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, will testify before the House Judiciary Committee that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have sought to bring unaccompanied minors into the country.
The agency will confirm that 70% of the arrests had no criminal record.
“The majority of the people who have come to this country illegally are from a country other than their own, and a great majority of them are criminals.”
Therefore, they will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
To process the children more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that require that some have to present themselves at the court within a month after being reported, instead of 60 days, which was the standard before, in agreement with the workers of the refugee camp.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, in place of the usual presence, to defend their case before a judge of immigration.
Those who are not considered fit for the job will be immediately deported.
With more time spent in custody, it is more likely that they will suffer from anxiety, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to the workers and the reports that have been provided in the last few months.
The advocates say that these concerns can intensify in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where the child is more likely to pass through the signs that indicate that a child is not ill.
They have added that children should be taken to the camp without having time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends, which could cause them a trauma that they have already experienced.
If the French and Turkish forces withdraw immediately, the US will withdraw its forces.
Directing himself to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Muallem, will ask the refugees who have fled Syria, despite the war that has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also acted as vice-prime minister, has said that foreign forces were operating illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will deal with it accordingly."
“They must be removed immediately and without conditions,” he said.
Muallem has insisted that the "war of terror" in Syria is practically over, and more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said that Damascus will continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged all of Syrian territory of all terrorist groups and of any foreign presence, illegal or otherwise."
The United States have 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Arab Syrian rebels who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 golf courses on the territory of a country that was bombed during the war.
On the assumption of the refugees, Muallem said that the conditions were good for their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for escaping "irrationally" and leaving the country.
“We have asked the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate the return of these people,” he said.
“They are assuming that it would be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement.
The diplomatic representatives of the United Nations have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in Idlib, the last rebel bastion, has favored the opportunity to continue the political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, there are three million people.
Muallem has also said that the agreement has "clear terms" and has expressed the hope that the military action will help to defeat the jihadists, who include combatants from the Al-Nusra Front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda, which will be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, sent by the UN, is waiting to call the first meetings of a new committee formed by members of the government and the opposition to start working on a new constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem will present the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, the box of which will have to restrict itself to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and will warn of possible interferences.
Why Trump will win for the second time.
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections in 2020, as many spectators probably expect, since the Democrats would probably hope that the impeachment process and the removal of the president would end with his presidency prematurely.
Who would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic president in the history of the country.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
From 2014, the number of spectators in the highest audience of the day has more than doubled, from 1.05 million to 2.1 million, and almost tripled, from 1.6 million to 4.5 million.
Fox News has a daily audience of 2.4 million viewers in the prime time, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show", from MSNBC, has led the cable news ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers in the prime time.

The dinners outside the parliament during the second half of the legislative term are more adjusted.
It is not surprising that there has been an influx of diners in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has made two members currently have to compete for the same seat.
This reassignment of the district of Pittsburgh, recently made by the Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, will give him the place in another district after the special elections last spring.
Keith Rothfus, a Republican, is running against Lamb in the 17th Congressional District, which is now in conflict with the 12th District.
The maps will be redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania rules that the districts are unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Pennsylvania Congressman Lamb is going to be a name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in special elections in March to represent the 18th Congressional District.
The Republicans have occupied the White House for more than a decade and President Donald Trump will win the district by 20 points.
The experts in politics give the democrats an unfair advantage.
The United States impose sanctions on the Salvador for its support of the Xina, but they will be lifted.
The diplomats have observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Pequín, with little response from Washington.
Trump will have a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and his associates will be leaving the Trump Organization.
The Department of State will decide to withdraw the caps of the diplomatic missions of the United States in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for the "recent decisions on the issue of not recognizing Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the department, this month.
The only thing that Salvadorans will see is the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which will receive $140 million in aid from the United States this year, according to estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and better economic conditions.
The sanctions proposed, which include restrictions on the use of public funds and restrictions on the issuance of visas, are harmful to the country and the region and will increase the number of deaths by murder and assassination.
With the postponement of the official meetings, the leaders of both countries are postponing a meeting of high level focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar trip as last year and which will be seen as a step forward to prevent emigrants from going to the United States.
But by the end of September, officials of the highest rank in the administration will clarify that the meeting is necessary, and that it will end with the club being dissolved.
Vice President Mike Pence has been selected to lead the U.S. delegation to the October summit, a signal of the importance the administration places on the issue, according to U.S. officials.

Study history.
The proper evidence in producing the special counsel's report could be the information from Robert Mueller's special counsel about possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which there are many proofs of in the public records.
Mueller also is looking into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on the 2016 elections.
If the Congress changes the rules, Trump could be held accountable by the organization, just as long as he prepares for it in advance of the voters, and, finally, in front of a jury of members of the party.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions that have to be taken by all the Atlantic countries that will affect how long the situation will last.

The history of the world fluctuates between periods of flexibility and periods of rigidity, and it accelerates or slows down inexorably with the progress of democracy.
The United States are facing various points of inflexion at the moment.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water since the day this newspaper will inform that, last year, he will suggest secretly recording the president and will speculate that it was not appropriate for the car accident.
Rosenstein says the information in the Times is not accurate.
“If the new investigation that the FBI has requested on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just, or if it confirms the allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
We, especially, will vote for the next Congress to make Trump responsible.
If these proofs are not enough, democracy will start to run out of control.

Norman Eisen, a former White House ethics lawyer, is the president of the Brookings Institution and the author of “The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House”.
Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers will face the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians would put them in a good position to qualify for the group stage of the Europa League.
A leg injury to Graham Dorrans will prevent him from playing the first 20 minutes of the season until the Rangers equalize 2-2 against Villarreal, but he believes that this result can be used as a springboard for great results.
“It will be a good position for us, because Vila-real is a good team,” he said.
“We’ll play the match to see if we can get a good result and then we’ll go out with a smile on our faces.”
Perhaps we could have something more at the end, but, in general, probably the tie will be a result.
They will be better in the first part, but we will be better in the second.
On Thursday, it's another big European tournament.
We hope to stay in the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they will try to get a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we will give everything and get a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes to the club, but now it's a good place to be.

I hope they can give him the ball as much as possible, and keep him in the team for the rest of the season.
Women lose their youth because of the stress of the job.
All participants in the survey had a clear idea of what they wanted to do, few people talk about it with their family.
Most of the people who have answered the survey say that they have talked to their partner about long-term care.
Only 10% of the respondents say they have spoken to the children.
People want to be cared for, but they don't want to be told how to do it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
Let's start here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you don't have to prepare your family because you can't communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your coach and your family to decide on and commit to a course of action, because these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: he can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your options for financing your treatment over a longer period of time may include a policy of insurance for cures over a longer term, a policy of insurance for life hybrid of value that will help you to cover the expenses or a policy of your own with the resources you have.
Prepare your legal documents: the tallies of the battles are legal.
Find a representative to be able to designate a person of confidence who supervises your medical care and ensures that the professionals complete your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of contracting a notary for your finances.
Select a person of trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't worry about the small details: Imagine that your relative has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify these details in a written document to be prepared.
The finances are not the only factor to be taken into account, but also the nine doctors who will be treating him.
Are the medicines?
Who will take care of the goose?
This is a practice round."

Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
More than 384 people have died in the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the city of Palu in Indonesia on Thursday, according to the authorities. They hope the death toll will rise.
With communications being down, the units in the area of Donggala, a region closer to the epicenter of the earthquake, have not been able to obtain information.
Palu, they have evacuated more than 16,000 people after the disaster.
Below are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the extreme east of the narrow coastal strip of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that is located at the north-west of the island of Celebes.
The region, a lower administrative division than a province, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important to the province, but is concentrated, mainly, in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by various tsunamis in the last 100 years, in agreement with the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami will kill more than 200 people and destroy hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit the west coast of Donggala, killing many people.
Indonesia is the country with the most volcanoes in the Pacific and it is possible to produce earthquakes with a certain frequency.
The following are the main earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
On 26 December 2004, a large earthquake off the coast of western Aceh province in Indonesia triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, most of them in Aceh.
A series of strong earthquakes will affect the western coast of Sumatra in the last week of March and the first week of April.
Many people die on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that killed almost 700 people.
A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people die.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, will trigger a tsunami of up to 10 metres that will destroy dozens of villages and kill 300 people.
In 2016, a strong earthquake will hit Pidie Jaya in Aceh and will cause destruction and panic, as the population will remember the devastation of the earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami will be produced, but more than 100 people will die because of the buildings that will collapse.
In 2018, a series of large landslides will kill more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island of Lombok.
The demolition will destroy a thousand buildings and leave a thousand tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's husband arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, will be arrested for domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a public report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police informant, when a known person tries to trick the police to report the suspected crimes, he will stretch the phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Detention Center, he is being held without bail, according to KTUU.
You will be tried on Saturday, when the judge will declare "not guilty, with security" when he is asked how he was declaring, according to this channel.
Palin is facing three Class A violations, which means he could be out of the game for a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He was also accused of a Class B misdemeanor, which could result in a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been penalized for slow play.
In December 2017, Todd Palin will be accused of assaulting his father.
Sarah Palin's going to trick the police to notify the presumed attack.
At the moment, the case is before the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In 2016, he will be accused of domestic violence, interference with the reporting of a domestic violence incident and possession of a firearm in a state of intoxication in relation to the incident.
His wife will declare that she had given him a slap in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin will be criticized by veterans groups for associating the behavior of her son with a post-traumatic stress disorder that resulted from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths.
More than 3,000 people have died after a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed millions of dollars.
The electricity and the communications systems are not working and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just along the coast of Central Sulawesi, in the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The social networks circulate videos of the impact.
Hundreds of people have gathered on the beach in the city of Palu to celebrate the festival.
Federal fiscal authorities are demanding a death penalty for a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people: a death penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is believed to have used a Home Depot truck to carry out the attack on a bike path in the West Side Highway, Lower Manhattan and cyclists during his route, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov intends to kill the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" will cause grievous bodily harm, in accordance with the advice of the district attorney.
All crimes can be punished with death, according to the document of the court.
After the attack, a grand jury federal is going to indict Saipov with 22 counts, including 9 counts of murder in the first degree, and 13 counts of attempted murder in the first degree. The federal prosecutors can use the RICO statute in cases of organized crime, in addition to a federal statute for violence and destruction of vehicles.
The fiscal office has said that the attack will require a "considerable planning and premeditation" and will describe the way Saipov acted as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused fear, pain and suffering to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the district of South Bronx has had a case of capital punishment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, will be sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of two drug dealers, but will be sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal court in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg died of a heart attack on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, will not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police will explain that they felt good about having done it.
In accordance with the accusation, Saipov will explain to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of the ISIS on his phone.
According to the police, they will also ask that the flag of ISIS be displayed in the room of the hospital.
He has been found not guilty of 22 faults.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, will say that they are "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
“We must consider that the decision to ask for the death penalty, in lieu of accepting a declaration of guilt and a life sentence without possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton will say.
The defense team of Saipov had previously requested that the prosecutors not seek the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party says Nigel Farage will be asked to resign as Brexit negotiator.
Nigel Farage is going to promise to mobilize "the popular tropes" today during a protest at the conference of the conservative party.
The former leader of the UKIP has said that politicians must "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of the party's members in the UK parliament suggested that he would lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone will tell the people of Birmingham that the UK would be out of the EU if Nigel Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenge facing the lady May at this hour to reconcile the deeply divided ranks of her party has been highlighted when the Conservatives who are in favour of the Union have presented a separate protest against the Brexit in London.
The first minister is fighting to keep her pledge to Chequers between the attacks of the Brexit party, the Brexit party and the unionists.
The allies insist that they will reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative responses and the pressure from the Euro-sceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
The Lord Bone will tell the meeting in Solihull that he wants to honour the Chequers agreement.
You are suggesting that Mr Farage has been elected a member of the House of Lords and that he has been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been at the course, he would have been out.
The member of parliament for Wellingborough will say: "I will defend Brexit, but we must honour the Chequers agreement."
To prove that you are not a servant of the EU, you will add: "We will not fight world wars to be servants."
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
The gentleman Bone will disregard the suggestions that the public opinion has been canvied from the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has canvied its mental attitude and wants to leave the EU is totally false."
The conservative Andrea Jenkyns will also be present at the march and will say: "Only the prime minister can decide".
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular with our party and our activists, who are the people who support the street and advise us to vote for elections.
They abandoned the Chequers agreement and started to escort."
In a message directed to Mrs. May, it will say: "The first ministers maintain their position when they maintain their promises."
Mr. Farage will say that the politicians of the meeting have to feel the pressure if they want to bring the decision taken in the referendum of 2016.
“Yes, that’s right, it’s a question of confidence between us (the people) and our political class.”
They are trying to trick us into believing that they are not trying to trick us.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he will add: "I will only vote for a party that will respect the Brexit vote".
We are mobilizing the popular tropes of this country that will give us the victory with the Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the players of the union will be making a march through Birmingham before the meeting.
A small number of activists will wave banners against the conservatives after the launch of the group last week.
The conservative member of the Lords Lord Adonis is going to be the victim of the security problems that the party is facing at the beginning of the conference.
These are the people who tell us that they can provide the systems and technology that we need and all the technology to make the border with Canada easier, for free trade without frontiers, for free trade with Ireland.
It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a Brexit to be reversed.
Warren has said he will consider running for president.
The US Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said she would consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat will speak at an open meeting in the western part of the state.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican candidate for governor of Massachusetts in 2016.
There have been speculations about the possibility of Trump running for president in 2020.
The event on Saturday night of late will be his 36th meeting with constituents in an open format or open town hall.
A member of the audience asked if she had planned to present herself as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren will respond that it is time that "we give the vagina to Washington to repair our government that does not work, and that includes a woman in the top tier."
A person arrested for the murder of three LSU students
The Baton Rouge police department will announce Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Thursday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at the press conference of the ETO at 11:00.
Publish a video of the shooting on Thursday and ask for help to identify the shooter.
Sims, 20 years old, will shoot and die in the morning of Friday.

The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the title of the world after the orders of the team gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment when Valtteri Bottas will be ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it will be clear that the orders of the Mercedes team have a big impact on the race.
From the pole position, Bottas will have a good start and will almost empty Hamilton's position on the first two laps and will invite Vettel to attack his position.
Vettel will enter the pits before Hamilton and will leave him with the traffic behind the car, which would have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes will have to stop at the pits and will come out behind Vettel, but Hamilton will advance after the pit stop on the outside of the track with a move that will cause the Ferrari driver to lose the inside line and risk being outside after the double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen will start at the back of the grid and finish in the first position on the last lap of the first race and on his 21st birthday.
After that, he will continue in good position for the rest of the race, as he will keep his tyres in good condition, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and pass him to the fourth position.
Finally he will enter the boxes at number 44, but he will not be able to increase the pace on the next eight laps and Raikkonen will be in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri has done a fantastic job all week and he's going to be a true gentleman who deserves to be told that he let you pass.
The team has done a fantastic job to keep a one-two finish.
His physical body will be terrible.
President Donald Trump is going to rip into Senator Dianne Feinstein this Saturday for not releasing the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a meeting with Virginia Occidental, the president will not speak directly about the testimony of Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but will comment that the person who was present at the Senate demonstrated that people are "sad, cruel and mendacious".
“One thing that could pass through the most innocent of those who are passing through the Senate, when you see anger, when you see pain, cruelty and lying, he would say.”
When you read the news and the comments and they say "No, I wasn't there."
No he been here.
Did you see?
Dianne Feinstein, do you want to filter?
Did you remember the answer? "Oh, what?"
No, no.
I didn't filter it out."
Yes, I'll wait a minute.
You're going to have to filter... No, no you're going to have to filter that.", he said while imitating the senator.
Feinstein will re-release the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July, but she will deny that the leak came from her office.
“I did not want to confirm or deny the allegations of the doctor, I did not want to leak her history,” Feinstein will explain to the committee, according to The Hill.
“I will ask for confidentiality and I will keep confidential.”
But the President's denial will not please the meeting of Saturday night: "Know what? Your body language will be terrible.
I don't know if I'll be able to do it, but I think it's the best physical condition I've ever been in."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct with three women, the president will suggest that the Democrats are using the statements for their own political purposes.
They are deciding to recover the power of the necessary means.
You want the cruelty, the injustice, you don't care who gets hurt, who gets run over to keep power and control, according to the President, according to Mediaite.

Patrick Dwyer will score two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars will be looking to repair the defeat of Friday against Belfast Giants, as they will be looking to win the game 5-3 on Saturday.

A controler aeri saved hundreds of passengers from a plane crash.
A controller from Indonesia has become a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a great earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Thursday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas have been produced in the area and many people have been trapped in the city of Palu.
However, despite his friends escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung, from Indonesia, will not give up his place at the tremulous tower of control at the Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He will stay at his place to ensure that the Batik 6321, which was on the runway at that moment, could take off safely.
After that, he was going to come out of the tower of control of the airport when he thought he was sinking.
You'll die later in the hospital.
An Air Navigation representative from Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, will say that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
You have to prepare a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost the helicopter before we arrived at Palu.
That's a good shot, we'll add it.
However, the authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We are waiting for the number of deaths to increase because there are still many people who have not been able to access the ruins, and there are still many people who have not been able to access the ruins," said the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The ones, with a shot of 6 feet, have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are providing assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, will explain to Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries a corpse.
The water is scarce.
All the minicats have been shot."
Jan Gelfand, director of the Red Cross International in Indonesia, will explain to CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is working against the rubble to help the survivors, but they don't know what they will find.
That's a tragedy, but I could still win."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, will arrive in Palu on Sunday and will tell the armed forces: "We need you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
Are you ready?", CNN will report.
Indonesia will suffer another major earthquake this year, which will kill more than 550 people.
An aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini has disappeared after the accident at the lagoon
The aeroplane that was operating a flight that was going to crash in a lagoon in the Pacific to Micronesia has disappeared, and they have already said that the 47 passengers and the crew have been evacuated with security.
Air Niugini has announced that they have not found a passenger.
The aeronautical industry is working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find him.
The aeroplane will not respond immediately to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats will help rescue other passengers and the crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities will announce tomorrow that people have been transferred to a hospital.
The aeroplane will say that yesterday there were six passengers on board and that all of them are in good health.
The accident was not the motive for the sequence of events.
The US Air Force and the US Navy have both confirmed that the plane will not be able to land on the runway because it will be too short.
Some witnesses think the plane will pass over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes will explain that the plane was going down.
“This is going to be a very positive thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes will say that they will have to walk with water around their waists until the emergency exits are opened, which is when the plane is sinking.
You can tell that the assistants are scared and are starting to cry, and that the player is going to get a wound on his head.
The US Coast Guard says that the mariners who were working on the ship to improve it also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport the people affected to land before the ship sank.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG airlines, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night that is going to burn a woman alive.
The prosecutor will close the case on Saturday in the review of the court of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The Justice Department's Paul Rowlett will testify for hours as an expert witness in the intelligence analysis.
The judge will describe how the records from the mobile phone were used to build the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett will say that he will give the location of different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicts his earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data shows that your mobile phone was in the area at the time in question and you will say that you were with Michael Sanford, the police will talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford will deny that he was in the city on that day.
When the fiscal asks if Tellis was at Sanford's truck when he said he was, Sanford will say he lied, because his truck was in Nashville.
Another incoherence is that Tellis will say that he knew two weeks before Chambers died.
The telephone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett will say that, after the death of Chambers, Tellis will suppress the messages, the tricks and the contact information of Chambers from his phone.
“He’s going to get rid of you from his life,” he said.
The defense will begin its final arguments on Monday.
The judge will say that he expected the jury to reach a verdict on the same day.

Another black person?!
A New Yorker asks for a pair of shoes after receiving a racist message.
A New York woman has filed a complaint against a couple for a discriminatory remark after they sent her a text message protesting that "there was another black person in the room."
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, will express her consternation at seeing that the new manager, Giselle Maurice, is black when she arrives to work for the first time in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON”, she writes to her husband in a text message.
But, in order to send it to his wife, Maurice will send it to her twice.
After having been given a "nasty" look by the "incommoding" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, the "incommoding" Mrs. Maurice will insist that the "incommoding" woman who had been given the job, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino, in agreement with the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice will pay the full amount for the work done and, after that, she will send the Uber home.
Yes, Maurice demands compensation for the inconvenience and asks for a compensation of, approximately, 350 USD per day for the work he has done for the last four months, even though there was no contract.
“I’ll show them that they can’t do things like that,” he said on Friday, “It’s discrimination.”
The pair have responded to the declarations that they are racist, stating that the support of Maurice was the most reasonable, since they could not trust her after she had been fired.
My wife is going to send me something that she doesn't want to say.
It's not racist.
No I am not a racist," said Joel Plasco, the Post.
But, wouldn't you rather let your children play with the children of those who have been killed, rather than with those who have killed them?
A baby?
The club is called a "viga" in Catalan.
Plasco, who has compared the demand with an "extortion", will say that he has two months to have a baby and that he was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to pursue something like that?”
It is not a very nice attitude," said the investor.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the public opinion has already condemned the decision of the social organizations and condemned the logic of the judge.
The editors of Paddington bear in mind that the readers should not identify themselves with an animal that speaks, in agreement with a new letter.
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who will be married shortly after the book is published, will say in relation to the letter: "It is difficult to place oneself in the place of someone who is being published for the first time before the book is published."
It's a great relief, and we're glad to know that you know about the great escape of Paddington."
You will explain that your father, who had been working with the BBC camera before writing the children's book about a little owl, was optimistic about the book's success. He will also say that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books will be "sweet", after the death of his father last year.
Paddington is a very important member of the family and he is very proud of his father, who has finally succeeded.
He was a quiet man; he wasn't a presumptuous one.
But, how could Paddington be so real for him? You're proud of him, even if it's not something you're proud of.
He thought that was the way out of Paddington.
And that was the only thing that was his and his alone, and he always recognized the merit of Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
In landing, they carry the girl to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where the doctors work to save her life.
“I often told them it was very difficult and that I didn’t expect to beat them” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
I've just been shot in the head and I'm going to die in the next two minutes and I'm going to say goodbye.
I have done it.
I told him: "Tashi, you're so good."
I'll go with you.
I'll go with you.
The medicines that they have given him so that he can continue playing are now being consumed and have been excreted from his system.
He had died before the time was up, and so the light went out.
Only one more hole to go, and I knew who was going to win.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I have to keep in good shape.
Finally, the lady Ednan-Laperouse, who is still grieving for the loss of her daughter, is boarding the plane with the other passengers, distressed by the experience she has just been through.
“No one knew,” he said.
He had the ball in the hole and the putt was easy.
It's difficult to explain, but during the round I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad the greenskeeper.
The sensation that I needed from my love and my understanding.
I know that I want a lot."
They want to prevent suicides at a bridge.
Two people who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been targeted by a phone call and text messages with inspiring numbers and phone numbers to call if you need help.
The daughter of the lady Davis, Tyler, had 13 years when she started to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, she committed suicide.
“I don’t want to feel that I have to win or lose, I just want to feel what I feel every day.”
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, with residence in Lydney, will say that her son was a promising young man with a contagious smile.
Everyone knows the importance of their own swing.
He always said that his light could illuminate any room.
You're going to die before you finish your round because you're in a "dark hole."
In 2014, the German of Tyler, who had 11 years at that moment, he will find out that he has his own life.
Mrs. Davis will say: "I am always concerned about the collateral effect."
Mrs. Davis is going to create the targets "because the people know that there are people to whom they can go, who can help, and if it is about a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies's friend for many years, is going to lose Mark, her husband, soon after the death of her husband.
He said, "I wasn't feeling well, nor was I depressed, nor was I acting like it."
Two days before Nadal's match, we will see a change in attitude.
You will play the course on the day of Nadal, when the children open their golf bags and they will not look at the others or the balls.
You can tell that the death of a loved one is a great trauma for them, but they have to work: "Open a hole in the family."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins an investigation.
I thought that if we could get something like that (an investigation with a limited scope and a limited time), we could achieve a certain unity.
Why didn't the gentleman Kavanaugh and his Republican party want an FBI investigation?
His reticence to see the moment is to be seen.
Only five days are left for the elections of the president of Catalonia. If, as expected, the Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened at the time of trying to get the president that the people want to arrive at the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has been caught using the telephone to trick the senators and pressure them to confirm the judge Kavanaugh, who worked for the White House under the Bush administration. He also knows the Bush's wife, Ashley, through the Bush administration's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, now, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Even if the gentleman Kavanaugh does not get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The name of the desertors from North Korea "cau" with Kim
The name of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un took power, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said that 1,127 people deserted last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
The gentleman Park will say that the strict controls on the border between North Korea and China and the increase in the cost of traffickers of people have been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Normally, the vast majority of desertors from the North are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The North Koreans have claimed that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people escape through Xina, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Xina considers the desertors migrants illegal, in place of refugees and sometimes they have to be repatriated by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which technically are still at war, have improved considerably in the last few months.
At the beginning of the meeting, the leaders of the two countries will meet in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on denuclearization.
This will happen after the historic meeting between the US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they will agree on general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, will blame the sanctions of the United States for the lack of progress in the negotiations.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally,” said the senator Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi said that Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical figure" and is not fit to work at the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority of the Nancy Pelosi's Cambra, Brett Kavanaugh, is a "historical" and that his temperament makes him unfit to work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi will make these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“You have to think that if a woman had acted like that, they would have said she was a “historical”, and that is what she said in relation to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, emotional, will deny the accusations of having sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both adolescents.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes crying and speechless while talking about his family and his years at the institute.
He will also condemn explicitly the Democrats of the committee and will say that the accusations against him are grotesque and coordinated by a character that is hated by liberals because Hillary Clinton is going to lose the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi will say that the witness of Kavanaugh showed that he could not work at the Supreme Court, since he showed his prejudices against Democrats.
He said he thought Clinton had been "disqualified" and would attack the Clinton and Democratic Party.
Pelosi will show reticence when asked if she would try to block the confirmation of Kavanaugh, if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats advise the House to vote for the majority in the Senate.
This is what I can say: if he did not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, and he is not qualified to be on the trial court either.
At present, Kavanaugh serves as a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi will say that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he will avoid questions about whether he will overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not the time for a person with a history of prejudice and bigotry to enter the Supreme Court and pretend to be a hero,” Pelosi said.
Women have to exercise their power.
It's a justifiable diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and no one can cry without it.
“We must love one another or die,” said Ms. Steinem, 45 years later.
“I don’t think it will be easy to keep up with you.”
You'll continue... "It will help a lot one woman who was a manager in some place that she was going to tell that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted in, when she was angry and started to cry, to tell the person she was talking to: "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry.
He continued after that.
It seems brilliant.
The roughs are permitted as an outlet for rage in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest records I have of one of my first fine shots in an office with a majority of men, once I finished I was so angry I was going to cry, it was the director of the company, who always scared me a little, who was going to grab me by the neck and throw me down the stairs.
“I don’t want to see you crying,” he said.
You're furious.
Think that you are sad and they will be happy, because they will have.
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when the senior Mr. Hart is discovered to be having an extramarital affair on a boat named Monkey Business, and he retires from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, will think there is no reason to run for president, and will decide to run herself.
“It’s not a well-considered decision,” he said, as he turned 30 years old.
There were other candidates for the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone will say "Blancaneu and the others"
He will arrive late to the campaign, and will be forced to return the water, so he will promise that he will not participate in the race if he does not return 2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
You will discover that some of your opponents, who have given $1,000 to the home, are only willing to give $250 to her.
“Do you think I have a handicap?” he asked.
When she announces that she will not be running a formal campaign, she will say that she is so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who have helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of recapturing diners and to guide voters, in place of the delegates, and the rage, and the sexism) that she will remain without words.
“I could have had a nervous breakdown” recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press.
I could have thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put on my tombstone?
"Are you crying?"
With the trade war between the US and China, Beijing can benefit.
The initial salvos of the trade war between the US and China will be deafening and, for now, it doesn't seem like the war will end soon, a distance between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, will issue his first warning to China at the beginning of this year, when he imposes tariffs on the main exports of China, such as solar panels, aluminum and steel.
The most significant climb this week will be the one that will produce this week's products, with a value of $200 million. These products will be subject to an import tax of 20% on all goods that arrive from China.
Beijing has responded to each attack in the same way and recently has put up the arms of 60 million dollars for 2.000.000.000 Americans.
She has promised to replicate the US and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be able to do so in the near future.
It is important that Washington does not back down from any of its demands, but to do so publicly would be very embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, if China plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long term by reducing its dependence on the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would start a cascade in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the testimony we have heard so far,” says Abigail Grace, an associate fellow at the Center for New American Security, a Washington-based think tank.
The refugees are prepared to return to their homes, according to the Minister of External Affairs.
She said that she is ready to return voluntarily to the refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than four years.
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem will say that the conditions in the country are improving.
At the moment, the situation on the street is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists have destroyed to restore normality.
It is very difficult to return to the country voluntarily for refugees who have left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their livelihoods and their ability to support themselves.
The EU estimates that more than 550,000 people have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also millions of people who come to the country and need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem will say that the regime is doing everything to help rebuild the country.
However, he would not accept conditional help or the help of the countries that are financing the insurgency.
The European team has advised the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team has won the Ryder Cup for the first time in 25 years, beating the American team by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, near Paris, France.
The USA have lost six consecutive times on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
The European team will try to regain the crown when Thomas Bjorn's team arrives at 14.5 points to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who will play the majority of the tournament, will hit the ball out of the water on the 16th hole, which will give him the victory.
The Italian golfer Molinari will shine in all his series and will convert into one of the four players who have achieved the 5-0-0 in the format that started in 1979.
Jordan Spieth will be paired with the less-qualified Thorbjorn Olesen, of Denmark.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, will lose 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played the last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with seven Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, is going to be the major winner that the tournament has had so far, with 25.5 strokes of difference.
“I can’t cry, but I can’t help it.”
It has been a very hard year.
Thanks, Thomas, for trying to help me and for creating this site.
I'm so happy, so happy to have won the cup.
The equipment is the most important... I am very happy to have been able to help.
The ball is passed to John Ram, who will beat the legend of the American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
I am incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I have been following him since I was 23 years old.
Woods will lose the four matches he had against France and has a record of 13-3-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An extraordinary statistic for one of the best players who has ever existed, with 14 major titles and only one behind Jack Nicklaus.
The North American team will play all week to try to win the Ryder Cup, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who will play in the PGA Tour.
The North American captain, Jim Furyk, will speak after the frustrating result of his team: "I am proud of these players, they have fought.
This morning we have had a moment in which we have pressed the European selection.
We have won.
Thomas has just finished his beer.
You are a great player.
His 12 players have played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and progress.
I estimate that these 12 players and I are proud to have been their captain.
There is no barrette.
They have beaten us."
