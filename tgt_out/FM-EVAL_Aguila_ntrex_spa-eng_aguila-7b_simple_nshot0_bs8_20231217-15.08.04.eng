The members of the Assembly (AM, by its acronym in English) of Wales worry about “looking like muppets”
Algunos Miembros de la Asamblea están desconcertados por la sugerencia de que su título debería cambiarse a Miembros del Parlamento de Gales (MWP, por sus siglas en inglés).
The Welsh Assembly is a devolved assembly of the Welsh Assembly Government, the devolved assembly of Wales.
I am very concerned that the Spanish government is trying to silence the Catalan people.
Un Miembro de la Asamblea del Partido Laborista declaró que a su grupo le preocupaba “que rimase con Twp y Pwp”.
For the reader: 
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that the whole group was “disappointed” and suggested alternative options.
Un miembro del Partido Conservador de Gales afirmó que su grupo estaba “abierto” al cambio de nombre, pero señaló que el salto de pronunciación de MWP a muppet era pequeño.
En este contexto, la pronunciación de la letra w en galés es parecida a la de la letra u en inglés de Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, declares: “By definition, the decision on any descriptive element of the membership of the Assembly will be the matter of the members themselves”.
The Welsh Government's 2017 Act of Assembly changed the name of the Welsh Assembly to the National Assembly for Wales.
The Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals to call the Assembly the Parliament of Wales in June, and the proposals received a broad support.
Sobre la cuestión del título de los Miembros de la Asamblea, la Comisión prefirió Miembros del Parlamento de Gales (o WMP), pero la opción MWP obtuvo la mayor parte del apoyo en una consulta pública.
The Assembly is suggesting alternative options, but the fight for consensus could lead to a stalemate and the president of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the bill in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on inhabilitation of Assembly Members and the design of committees.
The members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of how to call them when they deliberate on legislation.
Macedonia's voters turn out for referendum on name change
The voters of North Macedonia are due to vote on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Greek government has consistently opposed the name of its northern neighbour, claiming it is a territorial claim and a violation of its sovereignty.
Macedonia's president, George Ivanov, says he will ignore the referendum on the name change
The name change is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.

The churches, he said, could be replaced by apartments full of the type of people who will not help the sanctuaries that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, and, therefore, accelerate the closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The first black church in Harlem was the African Methodist Episcopal Church, founded in 1853.
The Church of the Nazarene in the United States of America
A church was built in the center of the town.
A black congregation took the reins of San Martín, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the street's top shops.
In the early morning of December 1940, the church was struck by a fire. The church was rebuilt in the same location, but the carillon was not rebuilt.
The Reverend Doctor David Johnson, son and successor, the Reverend Doctor David Johnson, loved to be called “the father of the poor” (the father of the poor).
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it a treasure trove, and “a musical instrument of national importance” and “a historical treasure”.
The carillon was built by the Riverside Church Carillon Society, a group of churchgoers who wanted to preserve the carillon after the church was demolished in the 1960s.
The Spanish Government, which had been in power for a short time, was overthrown by the people of Lima, and the new government, which was formed, was composed of the most distinguished and patriotic men of the country.
The story of San Martín in the last months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought by the leaders of the church and others by the Bishop of the Episcopal Church and others by the Diocese Episcopal.
The parish board, the board of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on their concern that the diocese “wanted to pass the costs” on the board, although this had not happened.
Some parishioners complained about lack of transparency from the diocese.

The Spanish supermarket chain El Corte Inglés has been the first to offer a service where customers can order food online and have it delivered to their doorstep.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that shops will look more like supermarkets as the chain tries to combat the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's ha integrado puntos de venta de descuentos de Argos en cientos de establecimientos y ha introducido varios Habitats desde su compra de estas cadenas hace dos años. Se considera que esto ha impulsado las ventas de comestibles y rentabilizado más estas adquisiciones.
The company's previous attempt to enter the beauty and pharmacy market was a failure.
Sainsbury's puso a prueba una operación conjunta con Boots a principios de los 2000, pero la colaboración finalizó después de una discusión sobre cómo dividir los ingresos de los puntos de venta de productos farmacéuticos en sus supermercados.

The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston secured victory
Un Livingston promocionado impresionó a los Rangers al conseguir la segunda derrota para Steven Gerrard en 18 partidos como entrenador del club del Ibrox.
The attack of Dolly Menga marked the difference. The Saints rose to second place.
Esta temporada, los de Gerrard aún no han conseguido ninguna victoria fuera de casa y el próximo domingo se enfrentan al Hearts, líderes de la tabla con ocho puntos de ventaja.

While the Livingston narrowed their lead to six wins in the division, the team's six-game winning streak is still their longest since the start of the season.
Spanish: 
The team of Holt had to have gone ahead ahead of the game much earlier than they did, causing a lot of trouble for the Rangers by their direct style of play.
Scott Robinson scored a goal, but his attempt was saved by the defense. After, Alan Lithgow missed a header after a cross from Craig Halkett.
The Rangers were the first to score, with a goal from midfielder Chris Killen in the 11th minute.
Sounders' goalkeeper, the best in the world.
The Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston looked for a way to get into the box, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to strike the ball from the edge of the area.
In the second half, the Rangers were the dominant force, but the goalie, Liam Kelly, was quite solid.
The game continued until the second half, when Alfredo Morelos forced a stoppage.
Allan McGregor, goalkeeper of the Rangers, rejected a shot by Scott Pitman, and Lithgow was far away from another one.
The game was played in a very rough and violent manner, with the referee being constantly chased by the players.

Spanish: 
A great performance and a great result for the Livingston.
The Spanish opinion is that they did a great job with their performance in the game, which followed the expectations of a great season.
Su estilo de juego y su plantilla apenas han experimentado cambios desde su ascenso, pero esto se debe en gran parte a Holt por la forma en que ha reforzado al equipo desde su llegada.
I had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was enormously effective and directed a defence magnificently organised, while Joe Worrall and Connor Goldson kept the two Connors on the edge of the frame.
Spanish: 
Although they had some good moments with Gerrard, they were still short on the ball.
The Rangers missed a lot of chances, and the lack of materialization was a good sign to the Spaniards, who are in the middle of the table.

Centenars de persones s'havien reunit per celebrar un festival a la platja de la ciutat de Palu el divendres a la nit quan les ones de fins a sis metres van arribar a la costa al vespre, arrossegant a moltes a la mort i destruint-ho tot al seu pas.
The earthquake occurred on the evening of December 23, 2010.
“When the tsunami warning was given, people were still at the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims”, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB, por sus siglas en indonesio) in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it carried everything that was in the way, houses, cars, trees, everything that was on land, everything that was on the sea floor, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in the open sea, everything that was in

The earthquake struck the island of Honshu, the largest island of Japan, on the morning of March 11, 2011.
Nugroho said the number of deaths and damage could be higher along the 300 km coastline to the north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The situation was so bad that the local government had to send a team of engineers to clear the road.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area.
This is a tragedy, but it could be worse.
The agency received many criticisms for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the agency officials claim that the waves had already reached the coast when the warning was issued.

The Macedonian people decided to change the name of their country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”, a gesture that would resolve decades of conflict with Greece, which had blocked their EU and NATO membership.
Spain, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbor to the north is a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into the NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on a new name, but the nationalist opposition maintains that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, which is the majority in North Macedonia.
The president of North Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, has said he will not vote in the referendum and a campaign has been launched to doubt the validity of the referendum.
En la papeleta del referéndum se planteaba la siguiente pregunta: “¿Está a favor de la adhesión a la OTAN y la UE con la aceptación del acuerdo con Grecia?”
The supporters of the name change, including the first Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a reasonable price to pay for Macedonia to join the European Union and NATO.
“Today I’ve come to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, so that they can live with freedom in the shelter of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us”, said Olivera Georgijevska, of 79 years, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, the vote will be a clear signal to the Spanish government that the Catalan people want to hold a referendum on independence.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in the Parliament.
The Commission on Election Observation (CEO) declared that the election was free and fair.
Spanish: 
“I have come to vote for my children, my place is in Europe”, said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their ballot in the referendum on a name change of the country that would open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30th, 2018.
In front of the Parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and removed chairs from the tents set up by those who were planning to disrupt the referendum.
“We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not by the back door.”
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter, we can establish relations with other countries, like China and Russia, and form part of the integration with the Euro-Asiatic Union.
The first minister Zaev says Macedonia's membership in NATO would bring investment to the country, which is needed to help it overcome its high unemployment rate.
“I believe that the majority of the citizens will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO”, Zaev said after depositing his vote.
The Spanish language is the official language of the Republic of Colombia.

The Labour Party is a socialist political party in the United Kingdom.
I'm intolerant with people who say what they think
When the activists of my local party voted to censure me, it just surprised me.
I am the last of a long line of Labour MPs who are told they are not welcome, and only because they say what they think.
Spanish: 
In Spanish: 
I was not in agreement with the economic policy of the previous administrations.
Spanish: 
I have been a member of the Labour Party for eight years, and during that time I have been a member of the Parliamentary Labour Party Committee.
I am sorry, but I am not aware of any such thing.
The Spanish language is a language of the past.
This began after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he shared a similar political vision started to expect him to change radically and adopt positions with which he had never been comfortable, such as security national or the single market of the EU.
I have always been aware of the diatribes of insults in the social media when I speak in public, regardless of what I say, and I have been subjected to a barrage of abuse on the internet demanding my retirement, accusing me of being a bad influence, and saying I should not be in the Labour Party.
I don't know if I'm the only one who has experienced this.
I am very lucky to be a member of the team.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face daily insults and racist abuse, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era is the normalization of the insults.
The Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that broad range of opinions and, with each change in rules, the party gets narrower.
I have received many counsels over the past two years, which have suggested that I should keep my head down and not make myself too noticeable.
But I don't want to get involved in politics.
I have been a member of the Labour Party since I was a teenager, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government of my school, which left my classroom in ruins.
I have never hidden my political views, and I have never tried to hide my political views.
I can't imagine that anyone in Nottingham East could have been unaware of my political views and areas in which I disagreed with the current leaders.
Only one thing I would say to those who promoted the motion of Friday is that I don’t understand these crazies on the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the electorate, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.

Two late goals from the final whistle can have decided the outcome of the game, but, without doubt, Ayr United deserved the victory in this entertaining Premiership game.
The team is in the lead of the league.
The Spaniards were the first to score, but the Pumas responded with a quick goal to tie the game.
“We’ve been tested in all the games and we’re still invincible, so I’m happy.”
Spanish: 
The 14th minute try by Grant Anderson, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr in front; but a yellow card to Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors for the game, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the deficit and Jason Baggot scored a try that was not converted.
Spanish: 
The second half started with a good start for the Reds, who took a 2–0 lead in the first half.
After a long break, there was a long break for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, and, when the game resumed, the Ayr side took the lead with a try by McDowall converted by Climo.
The Cardinal's Cardinal, Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, was given a yellow card by referee Bruce Colvine, after a great pressure on the Ayr defence.
The Scotsman's report of the game said that the English were "the better team" and that "the Scots were not up to the task of stopping the Scots".

In Bolivia, a land without sea, even remember vividly the lost coast to Chile in a bloody conflict for the resources that took place in the nineteenth century, and the desire to return to navigate the Pacific Ocean.
The Bolivian government has been working on a new constitution, which would give it the power to nationalize the country's natural resources.
“Bolivia has the spirit, a spirit of unity and serenity and, by definition, is waiting for the result with a positive vision.”
Many Bolivians will watch the verdict of the International Court of Justice in large screens across the country, with the hope that the court of La Haya will rule in Bolivia's favour that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sea-level outlet to the Pacific Ocean.
Evo Morales, the controversial Bolivian president, has been a source of controversy in the region.

Trump's rally in West Virginia, Spanish: 
Trump starts campaigning in West Virginia.
The first of the five rallies Trump will hold this weekend, the event is in Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation of his candidate for covering the vacancy of the Supreme Court in the interim, Trump is attempting to obtain support for the next election cycle, which Republicans are running the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are deposed in November.
¿A qué hora es el mitin de Trump en West Virginia y cómo se puede ver online?
Trump's rally in West Virginia is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch it online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the upcoming confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is under fire for alleged sexual misconduct and has been left in the wings of a Senate vote on his confirmation.
Spanish: 
The campaign of President Trump's next five rallies is designed to “inspire and encourage” Republicans to “stand up and fight” for their party's “majority” in the Senate and House of Representatives, Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while campaigning.”
Programado en el estadio Wesbanco Arena de Wheeling el mitin de esta noche podría atraer a simpatizantes de “Ohio y Pensilvania, así como tener cobertura en los medios de comunicación de Pittsburgh”, tal como informó el West Virginia Metro News.

After three sessions, the foursomes of the Sunday afternoon are the most exciting part of the Ryder Cup.
The pendulum swing is a concept invented by the sport of baseball, but the players believe in it, even though it is a complete invention.
Then, where is the impulse now?
“We were six points ahead and now we’re four points ahead,” said Spieth. “That’s a little push.”
Europe has a lead, but Spain has ahead
The Americans are feeling like they have something to cheer about and they have a lot of reasons to be cheerful, among them the pairing of Spieth and Thomas, who played together all day and achieved three points each.
Spanish: 
The screams of celebration rose to a roar as the round ended, introducing a vital putt for a draw.
The putt that gave them the victory was received with a roar, a roar that echoed through the stands.
“What’s the point of all this?”, asked Spieth.
This is the way to win the championship.
Spanish: 
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The odd couple: the odd couple.
“Moliwood” was the only pair that did not bogey the Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys the Friday afternoon, the Thursday afternoon and in the last nine holes of the Friday morning.
Their streak and the way they flowed their energy with the crowded audience at the bullicious Sunday's show clearly shows that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there won't be any other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Spanish: 
Spanish: 
Spanish: 
A double bogey and two bogeys in the last nine holes sent the Spaniard and the Swede to the grave.
But the Sunday will be a day of no help.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see close up because you can see the interactions between the partners, the advice that is given and the advice that isn't, and the way a strategy can change in a moment.
The Americans have been playing better as a team and have a great lead going into the final round, but this session of foursomes also showed that the US team is not afraid to fight, something that some doubted.
Spain sees the best of the best
Spain parted with a good lead after the first day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The Spanish duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods who was in trouble, falling four points behind.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, won the World Cup for the first time in history.
Spain: 
The American golfer Jim Furyk needs to win eight of the 12 matches to retain the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four consecutive points.
The Spaniard, who had been the only player to beat Woods in the fourballs, was the only player to beat him in the fourballs.
Spanish: 
Justin Rose, que estaba descansado para los fourballs de la mañana, volvió a ser la pareja de Henrik Stenson en los foursomes, derrotando a Dustin Johnson y Brooks Koepka, número uno y número tres del mundo respectivamente, con un resultado 2-1.
Although the day was calm and sunny in the southwest of Paris, Europe was not all it seemed.
The American team, led by three-time champion Jordan Spieth, was the only one to break 70 in the final round.
Consiguieron una apasionante victoria 2-1 ante el Ian Poulter y español Jon Rahm en los fourballs y después derrotaron a Poulter y Rory McIlroy por 4-3 en los foursomes tras haber perdido los dos hoyos iniciales.
En la historia de la Ryder Cup, que un equipo se recuperase de una diferencia de cuatro puntos en los partidos individuales solo ha sucedido en dos ocasiones, aunque Furyk, como poseedor del trofeo, solo necesita un empate para conservarlo.
Although they have been the best two days, it seems that the second day is over.
Spanish: 
The UN Security Council voted to impose new sanctions on North Korea, which were unanimously approved by the UN Security Council.
Ri Yong Ho declared before the General Assembly annual meeting of the United Nations that North Korea had adopted “important goodwill measures” in the past year, such as stopping the nuclear tests and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear facilities and pledging to uphold the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“But, of course, we’re not going to give up our claim to the land.
“If we don’t have trust in the United States, we can’t have trust in our own country.”
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington’s refusal to grant a “phased” denuclearization, his declaration is important, as it is unclear whether Pyongyang will accept a unilateral denuclearization.
Ri made reference to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first North Korean leader in office and a U.S. president in office met in Singapore on June 12, 2018, when Kim committed to working towards “nuclear disarmament” on the Korean Peninsula and Trump pledged to ensure North Korea’s security.
Corea del Norte ha perseguido el fin oficial de la Guerra de Corea de 1950-53, pero Estados Unidos ha dicho que Pyongyang debe renunciar antes a su armamento nuclear.
The United States has been the most vocal in its condemnation of the North Korean nuclear program.
“The United States have consistently insisted on the nuclear disarmament and have increased pressure by means of sanctions in order to achieve their objective of ending the war, even if it means objecting to a declaration of cessation of hostilities.”
The idea of sanctions can make us fall on our knees.
The problem is that the Spanish government is not willing to accept the results of the referendum.

Spanish: 
In the past, the North Korean government has held three meetings between Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea had been the party interested in the nuclear disarmament in place of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the peninsula of Korea would not be in a stalemate like this.”
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from the speech he gave at the UN General Assembly last year, when he said that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles towards the United States after the “evil” Trump called him a “rocket man”.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who the year before threatened to “destroy totally” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in the advance toward disarmament, but said that much more was needed to be done until North Korea was fully disarmed and denuclearized.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, said on Wednesday that he would not rule out a military option to quell the protests in the United States, but he did not rule out a military option to quell the protests in the United States.

China and Russia allege that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its recent advances.
The United States will continue to enforce the Security Council’s sanctions, which are still in force, until we achieve a fully verified and unambiguous nuclear-weapons-free North Korea.
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding to its nuclear and missile programs.

The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, has been reported to have been hospitalized in Beijing, China, after suffering a stroke.


The meeting was held in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital, and was attended by the U.S. and North Korea’s top leaders.

El curso, que se imparte en el Instituto de Tecnología de Massachusetts, se llama "Sleep and Cognition" (Sueño y cognición) y está dirigido por el profesor de neurología de Harvard, el doctor David R. Sinclair.
A Spanish teacher discovered that students at the number one university in the world don't know how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The motivation for starting the course came after giving a talk about sleep deprivation affecting learning.
“At the end of the year, a girl came up to me and asked me why I hadn’t told her about this before.
I was surprised to hear that nobody had ever told me the importance of sleep, which is why I am so happy to learn that I can now sleep in the night.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains the basic concepts about good sleep habits and how they contribute to academic success and overall well-being.
Dr. Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were not sleeping during the week.
The course is a one-hour course.
In a section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sporting shoes, and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, and the impact of lack of sleep on sporting performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
Spanish: 
The Spanish icon is a symbol of the campus and a symbol of the university.
We know that it won’t change the students behavior instantly.
Spanish: 
Spanish: 
Sleep is the secret weapon of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as it is believed to help to avoid hunger, and to eat less, because the brain generates a feeling of hunger when it is deprived of sleep.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California high school student, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
Spanish: 
The school is looking to expand its enrollment to include students who have completed a bachelor's degree in a related field.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students think about putting an alarm for bed and another for awakening, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm, and therefore have trouble falling asleep.

The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside of home, when the 
Los de Ibrox querían conseguir su primera victoria fuera de casa desde el triunfo 4-1 de febrero en St. Johnstone, pero el equipo de Gary Holt derrotó al de Gerrard por segunda vez en 18 partidos como entrenador, dejando a su equipo a ocho puntos de los Hearts, desbocados líderes de la Ladbrokes Premiership.
The attack on Menga was a disaster for the Rangers, who were outplayed by the Spaniards.
Now, the Rangers fall to sixth place, the Livingston climb to third
Puede que los Rangers se encuentren con más problemas, ya que el juez de línea Calum Spence tuvo que recibir asistencia médica por una herida en la cabeza después de que, supuestamente, alguien lanzase un objeto desde el fondo visitante.
Gerrard changed eight of the starting players who won the game against Ayr, progressing to the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup.
The Hearts, who were in the lead for most of the game, were unable to hold on to their lead and were beaten by a well-organised Livingston side.
The Rangers have had more the ball, but the Lions have scored more goals.
Scott Pittman should have scored at the beginning of the game, when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman, who passed through the defense, leaving Allan McGregor alone in front of McGregor, but he shot the ball over the crossbar.
Keaghan Jacobs sacó una falta en profundidad para el capitán Craig Halket, pero su compañero en la defensa, Alan Lithgow, solo pudo enviarla fuera por el palo largo.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed more hopeful than conviction.
No doubt about it, Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalised in the 15th minute, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson made no earsore of it.
The Rangers got two shots on target in the first half, but the former Celtic goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, wasn't in any trouble to deal with the headed goal from Lassana Coulibaly and the unremarkable cross from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by the Livingston was a surprise, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort dedicated.
Spanish: 
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher scored, keeping calm and passing the ball to Scott Robinson, who scored the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an immediate impact, as he passed to Morelos, but Kelly was able to block him.
Aun así, el Livingston siguió llevando los visitantes exactamente hacia el tipo de juego que le gusta, con Lithgow y Halkett despejando un pase largo tras otro.
The Spaniards could have made more profit in the final stages, but McGregor held on to take the stage win.
The replacement Rangers, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.

A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them.
Como parte del tratamiento, la vacuna enseña al sistema inmunológico a reconocer las células malignas.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.

Spanish: 
A woman treated with the vaccine, who taught the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her cancer disappear for 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab to make them “see” a common protein found in many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
The study, which was published in the journal Nature Medicine, was led by the National Cancer Institute’s Institute of Cancer Biology and the National Cancer Institute’s National Institute of Health.
HER2 “promueve el crecimiento de diferentes tipos de cáncer”, como el de mama, ovario, pulmón o el cáncer colorrectal, explicó el profesor Berzofsky.
A study of the immune system in cancer patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of cancer.

It didn't work out.
Kanye West was booed up in the studio of Saturday Night Live after a performance that was erratic and praised President Donald Trump.

The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the tough guy, saying that those roles on screen often transmitted to young men that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes something went wrong and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, que recientemente se casó con su compañera de reparto en Juego de Tronos, Rose Leslie, también de 31 años, admitió que le parece “bastante importante” abordar esta cuestión.
“I think it’s important to be aware of the masculinity that we’ve been taught, and to be able to recognize it, and to be able to change it.”
“What have we been teaching men while they were growing up, thinking of the problems they would face later?”
Spanish: 
Spanish: 
What is taught on television, and in the street, does it make young people feel like they have to be this way?
I think it is a question of how we change it.
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with the education of young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel of Game of Thrones when the series ends in summer, saying he is “tired of battles and horses”.

Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked any information on the Senate Republicans and says it is “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
La representante Maxine Waters criticó el sábado las acusaciones de que un miembro de su personal había publicado los datos personales de tres senadores estadounidenses del Partido Republicano en las páginas de Wikipedia sobre legisladores.
The New York Times
“lies, lies, and more lies”, commented Waters on Twitter.
Supposedly, the information published included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee, of Utah.
El jueves, una persona desconocida del Capitolio publicó la información en Internet durante una sesión del panel del Senado relativa a las acusaciones de conducta sexual inapropiada realizadas contra Brett Kavanaugh, candidato al Tribunal Supremo.
The filing of the report was made by Senator John McCain, who was the Republican candidate for the presidency in 2008.
Sitios conservadores, como Gateway Pundit y RedState, informaron de que la dirección IP que identifica el origen de las publicaciones estaba asociada con la oficina de Waters e hicieron públicos los datos de un miembro del personal de Waters, según el Capitolio.
“This accusation is completely false and a complete lie”
“The member of my personal staff whose personal data, security, and personal information have been affected by these false and fraudulent allegations and the leak, was not the source of the information.”
This is a complete lie.
The statement by Waters sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Desmiente esta información con enfado”, escribió Fleischer.
“This suggests that temperance is necessary to be a member of Congress.”
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
Don't rebel against it.
Do not question the motives of the accuser.

En cualquier caso, el incompetente Johnny English, con sus ojos saltones y su rostro inexpresivo, ha renovado su licencia para meter la pata por segunda vez. Solo su nombre ya da pistas de que, más que nada, se trata de una creación cómica pensada para territorios cinéfilos de habla no inglesa.
The ridiculous agent secret who, despite his strange pretensions of glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a smattering of that guy who played a note in the theme of Carros de fuego that was played in the ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics opening.
The Spanish version of the commercial is based on the mysterious international man traveller, who was represented by the famous Atkinson in the TV commercials of Barclaycard.
Spanish: 
Me encantó ver a Johnny English acercándose a un helicóptero mientras las hélices chocaban contra el casco.
The film is a pleasantly silly romp, but the comedy isn't quite as funny as it could be.
El humor parece más dirigido a niños que a adultos y, para mí, las absurdas desventuras de Johnny English no son tan ingeniosas y acertadas como los chistes silenciosos de Atkinson en el papel de Mr. Bean.

El Partido Laborista niega que esté elaborando un plan para que los británicos trabajen cuatro días a la semana, pero cobren cinco
The Labour Party is going to propose a four-day week
Spanish: 
Spanish: 
According to the sources, the idea “fits” in the economic agenda of the party’s plans and agenda.
This change to a four-day week has received the support of the Congress of Unions, which is a way for workers to benefit from the economy’s changing nature.
The Labour Party is looking to review its immigration policy.
"We don't expect to achieve a four-day weekend in the near future, but the weekend working of four days is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate into the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the strategy of the party as a whole".
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this type of ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day workweek in its election manifesto.
Spanish: 
Un portavoz de los laboristas dijo: "La semana laboral de cuatro días no forma parte de la política del partido y no se va a discutir en este momento".

The vote of Graham, however, seems unchangeable.
"I have already made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and I wouldn't hesitate to dismiss the allegations," said.
"Dra. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it tautly", said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.

¿Qué es el Global Citizen Festival? ¿Ha logrado reducir la pobreza?
Este sábado, Nueva York albergará el Global Citizen Festival, un festival anual de música, donde se reúne un impresionante cartel de estrellas en pro de una misión igualmente impresionante: acabar con la pobreza en el mundo.
Este año, en su séptima edición, el Global Citizen Festival verá cómo decenas de miles de personas se desplazarán al Great Lawn del Central Park para disfrutar de actuaciones como las de Janet Jackson, Cardi B y Shawn Mendes, pero también para concienciar sobre el objetivo real del evento: terminar con la pobreza extrema en el 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a global campaign that began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international activists that aims to end poverty through active engagement.

Spanish: 
Do you think that the idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of the "clicktivism" that we call the act of believing we are making a real change by signing a petition online or tweeting?
The Spanish Government has been accused of using the same tactics of the Spanish government in the past, including the use of the police and the judiciary to suppress the Catalan independence movement.
The campaign has been supported by the following organizations:

The Spanish language is the official language of the Republic of Puerto Rico.
"The situation that is facing my son, by what he has been through since he came back, they know very well the other families that suffer the effects of PTSD and other injuries that come with our soldiers", said at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin se refería a este arresto como el gran tabú del que nadie quiere hablar, y comentó sobre su hijo y otros veteranos de guerra que "vuelven con un comportamiento diferente, endurecidos, preguntándose si realmente existe ese respeto hacia lo que sus compañeros soldados y aviadores, así como todos los demás miembros del ejército, han dado a su país".
The arrest was made Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, where he was charged with a domestic violence incident and possession of drugs or alcohol while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.

Dijo que su compañero "y sus hijos, que son miembros de una pandilla violenta", abusaron de ella, pero los funcionarios de EE. UU. denegaron su solicitud de asilo el 20 de julio.
The Spanish Government is investigating the death of a Mexican woman in Texas.
Los abogados que representan a estos estados que defienden a Grace describieron a El Salvador, Honduras y Guatemala, que generan una gran cantidad de solicitudes de asilo a EE. UU., como naciones que se enfrentan a problemas generalizados relacionados con la violencia doméstica y de pandillas.
The new immigration policy of the United States reversed a 2014 decision that took the Immigration Appeals Board (BIA, por sus siglas en inglés) to grant asylum to domestic violence victims.
The Washington Post
"According to federal law, all asylum applications must be adjudicated on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case and, in this case, the exception infringes that principle", reads the amicus brief.
The petitioners also argued that the current immigration policy is unfair to the economy of the United States, as it is likely to reduce the number of immigrants who enter the country.
The United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions orders immigration judges to deny asylum to victims of domestic violence and domestic terrorism.
"Mayors of 18 who have been subjected to a "reasonable fear" of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, and who have a "reasonable belief" that they would face persecution if they returned to their home country, may apply for asylum in the United States",
The asylum never was created as a measure to solve all the bad problems, even if it is a good idea to help people who are in need.

US Ambassador to China accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published an advertisement in a U.S. daily where they promoted the benefits of trade between China and the United States, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the press to spread its propaganda.
The China Daily, a Chinese-language newspaper in Iowa, was the subject of a tweet by President Donald Trump on Wednesday, which referred to the paper’s payment for its editorial content.
The accusation that made by President Donald Trump on the alleged Chinese interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election marked a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to pressure Beijing.
The United States and China have been engaged in a trade war since the early 1990s.
The tariffs imposed by China that were intended to punish the United States have been applied to the export industries of Iowa and other states that supported the Republican Party, according to experts and the Chinese government.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa Governor, said Beijing had harmed U.S. agricultural exports to China and hurt American businesses.
Según escribió Branstad en un artículo de opinión en el Des Moines Register del domingo, China "está intensificando aún más esa presión con publicaciones de anuncios en nuestra prensa libre".
"To treat to spread his propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom to try to publish an advertisement in the Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
"In the end, the only voice that counts is that of the government, and the only reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people have about the troubled trajectory of their economy is that the media are firmly under the control of the Communist Party.

The New York Times: "Republicans are split over Trump's plan to raise taxes on the rich" (en inglés)
The Republican Party is closing ranks behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault, in a bid to regain control of the Senate.
The Spanish government has been very quick to condemn the violence and the police brutality.
"In this type of issues, it is not possible to backtrack", said Professor Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in New York.
The Spanish language is a language of the United States of America.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday; they won't forget it in November or December", said Senator Jean-Pierre, a progressive and national spokesperson for the group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
The Friday morning, the protesters who gathered at the Senate's doors entertained themselves with "November is coming!" (¡noviembre llegará pronto!) as the Republicans who controlled the Committee on the Judiciary decided to go ahead with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"The spirit of the people is with us", said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst.
The impact of the Catalan independence referendum is already being felt in the stock market.
Pero podría ser incluso mayor, especialmente entre las mujeres indecisas de los barrios de las afueras y las votantes más jóvenes, de entre 18 y 29 años, quienes no suelen votar aunque no les guste el presidente. 

English: 
Even before the public testimony of Ford, the Republican Party had already begun to investigate the allegations against him.
"This issue has become a big one for the Republican Party", said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, according to NBC News.
"It's not just a vote on the committee or the final vote, it's also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they've treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
The Spanish government is not going to be the only one to be surprised by the decision of the Supreme Court.
A new YouGov poll shows that the public believes that the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh are true.
The majority of the respondents (72 %) believed that the testimony of Kavanaugh was likely or definitely false, while the rest believed it was either true or probably true.
The FBI is investigating the allegations made by former FBI agent Mark Ford, who was fired after he was accused of sexual harassment.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee the weekend last and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her when she was 17 years old.
Por su parte, Ramirez alegó que el candidato al Tribunal Supremo le mostró sus genitales en una fiesta cuando estudiaba en Yale en los años 80.
The inventor of the World Wide Web starts a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Spanish: 
Inrupt es el último proyecto de la leyenda de la tecnología. Una empresa que se basa en la plataforma de código abierto Solid de Berners-Lee.
Spanish: 
En una entrevista exclusiva con Fast Company, Berners-Lee bromeó diciendo que la intención que se esconde detrás de Inrupt es "dominar el mundo".
"It's gotta be now", said on the phone.
"It's a historic moment".
The application uses Solid's technology to enable users to create their own personal data warehouse online
Puede contener listas, listas de tareas pendientes, el calendario, la biblioteca de música y otras herramientas personales y profesionales.
You can use the same tools that you use every day, but you can also use them in a new way.
The ability to control who can access what data is a unique feature of online storage.
The company calls it "data-driven training".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the general director of the company, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and the skills necessary to reach everyone.
The World Wide Web is a web of hyperlinks that connect the content of the web to other web pages.
A partir de esta semana, desarrolladores tecnológicos de todo el mundo podrían crear sus propias aplicaciones descentralizadas con las herramientas que hay disponibles en el sitio web de Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said he was not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change to their business models.
"We won't ask permission".
En una publicació en Medium el dissabte, Berners-Lee va escriure sobre Inrupt que "la seva missió consisteix a proporcionar energia comercial i un ecosistema per ajudar a protegir la integritat i la qualitat de la nova web creada en Solid".
En 1994, Berners-Lee transformó Internet cuando fundó el World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) en el Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The Internet is a global network of computers that connects people around the world.
A pesar incluso de estar lanzando Inrupt, Berners-Lee seguirá siendo el fundador y director del World Wide Web Consortium, la Web Foundation y el Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era", said Tim Berners-Lee.

Spanish: 
The stone was unveiled by the grandchildren of the late Mr. and Mrs. John H. H. H. H. H.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the Medal of Honor.

The Spanish lieutenant was killed by a sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I can never reach his height, but they were very inspiring."
El presidente de la Cámara de Representantes, Paul Ryan, y el presidente del Senado, Robert Menéndez, también asistieron al servicio conmemorativo.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is shown when he is given a huge show of support".

The Gay Dude
El saltador olímpico Tom Daley dice que creció sintiéndose inferior al resto a causa de su sexualidad, aunque esto fue, a su vez, lo que le motivó a convertirse en un triunfador.
Spanish: 
En el primer programa de Desert Island Discs de Radio 4, presentado por Lauren Laverne, dijo que su intención al hablar de los derechos de los gays era transmitir "esperanza" a otras personas.
I was a little bit scared of the Olympics, but I was really excited to be a part of it.
The show's host, Kirsty Young, is absent for a few months with a health issue.
In the first episode of Laverne, Daley, who was shown to be a margined child, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "you don't accept socially that you like kids and kids".
Spanish: 
I was a bit of a nerd, but I wasn't gay.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games of this year in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
I told him I was proud to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints because I felt that I was living in a country where I could be open about my faith.
The Spanish-American actor and director, who has been in the movies for over 40 years, has been married to his wife, the actress and model, Marisol, for over 40 years.
Daley se casó el año pasado con el ganador de un Oscar, que le lleva 20 años, si bien especificó que la diferencia de edad nunca había sido un problema.
"When you live so much from so young" (was at his first Olympics with 14 years and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age that has passed through the same highs and lows.
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "perspective global" had changed."
"If I had been asked to answer the same question last year, I would have said 'I have to win a gold medal.'
But I'm not going to give up on the Olympics.
My gold medal is my Olympic medal.
Su hijo se llama como su padre, Robert, que murió a la edad de 40 años después de que se le diagnosticara un cáncer cerebral.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, of course, one of the last things he asked was if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in first row.
"I was unable to tell her I was not going to be in the front row", said.
"He had his hand between my legs when he died and I wasn't sure if he was dead or not until he stopped breathing and I realized he wasn't invincible", said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was so excited to be in the Olympic pool with my family. I was so proud to be in the Olympic pool with my family.
Este hecho fue también el que le inspiró a la hora de elegir su primera canción, Proud de Heather Small, que le acompañó en la fase de preparación de los Juegos Olímpicos. Todavía se le ponía la piel de gallina.
The World at Night
Spanish: 
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid it becoming a sad tale.
Mickelson, who played in the event that is held every two years to set a record for 12th time, was desbanked by Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes of the Saturday.
In the middle of the action, as many times he has done for the United States, the five times champion of majors has had to conform himself with watching and, in other moments, trying to improve his game in the field and then, in the end, trying to correct what troubles him.
Never the most direct of the drivers, even in the height of his career, the player of 48 years isn't in his best shape for the course, where the rough longs drives continually punishes him.
Y, si el campo ya no es lo suficientemente desalentador, Mickelson, en el noveno partido del domingo, se enfrenta al brillante campeón del British Open, Francesco Molinari, quien se ha unido al debutante Tommy Fleetwood para ganar los cuatro partidos que han jugado esta semana.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12th hole, had not been so impressive in the first 12 holes, they could have been in a position to challenge for the lead.
The Spanish Furyk
"He was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he was very nice to me, he
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and has made a lot of contributions to these teams before and during this week.
I don't think I'd have been able to play two games.
I thought we would be more, but that was how it was and that’s how it is.
I want to be there, like the rest of the world.
The Sunday round will be a tough one for Mickelson, who has not won a major in over a decade.
It could be the last of a long career of Ryder Cups.
Spanish: 
"It's funny, sarcastic, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, funny,
I think it was fun for the younger kids to have him as a mentor.
The game is very fun.
The Spanish captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the leadership is about to disappear. 

English: 
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you have a substantial lead in the last two days of the Ryder Cup, you can easily become a difficult tournament.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a band of Seve Ballesteros' Spaniards kept a five-point lead over the Americans, but at the end they couldn't hold on and the Americans won by a narrow margin of 14½-13½.
"We're not going to stop remembering that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, but we did it in Valderrama and we won, but by a little bit.
The Spanish language is the official language of the Spanish Republic.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Spanish: 
This is not a game of chance.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win the trophy, and that is our main objective.
I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the time, I say it all the
I'm very proud of the team.
Tomorrow is a new day.
What is the most important thing?
It's great to share the good news with a partner when things are going well, but when things go bad, you put a lot of pressure on yourself.
This is the message that we have to send to the players, to show them that they can do better.
Now it's time to leave the past behind and start a new life.
Bjorn, his partner Jim Furyk will try to do better individually than they did as a team, being the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who each won three points of four.
El mismo Furyk ha estado en ambos extremos en los últimos días de esos grandes torneos y ha formado parte del equipo que ganaba en Brookline y luego acabó perdiendo cuando Europa llevó a cabo el "Milagro de Medinah".
"I remember every word", he said when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, inspired his team to win the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we have to start strong, like we did in Brookline, and we have to start strong, like we did in Brookline.
When all of us advance in the same direction, the pressure is on the intermediate parties.
The Spanish version of the song was released on the band's official website on March 19, 2010.

German submarine "U-571" is the first German submarine to be sunk by an American submarine
The German Navy’s new frigate should have been ordered in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but construction has been delayed due to defective systems and the increasingly progressive cost of the ship, reported the local media.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The ship should have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the ship was delivered delayed the completion of the project.
The four ships of the class Baden-Wuerttemberg that requested by the Navy will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
We know that they will include a powerful gun, a battery of anti-aircraft missiles, and some advanced technologies, like radar, infrared, and acoustic signals.
The ship's hull is made of aluminium alloy, which is a high-strength, high-tensile material. The hull is designed to withstand the stresses imposed by the ship's operations.
The German navy has been plagued by delays in the past, and the latest ships are expected to be out of service by the time they are commissioned.
La desafortunada fragata F125 ocupó titulares el año pasado, cuando la Marina alemana rechazó oficialmente poner el navío en funcionamiento y lo devolvió al astillero Blohm & Voss en Hamburgo.
The ship was delivered to the shipyard on March 31, 2010.
The ship was returned to the US Navy in August 2005.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors: half the personnel on the former Bremen class frigates.
The ship's weight is too great, and the ship's performance is reduced.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" was the largest ship of the German navy.
The Spanish government has been criticized for its handling of the crash
The company has been valued at €2.5 billion ($4.5 billion)
The problems that are attributed to the new frigates are of special relevance to the light of the recent warnings on the German Navy’s naval power.
El ministro de Defensa de Alemania, Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg, dijo que la Marina alemana se está quedando sin barcos capaces de desplegarse.

The Spanish official said that the problem has worsened with time, because old ships have been scrapped, but new ships have not been built.
The Spanish Government has decided to build a new class of frigates, which will be called the "Baden-Wuerttemberg" class.

This new study, which has been carried out in a Scottish Highland, aims to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Spanish: 
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano bats, as well as the Daubenton brown bat and long-eared brown bat of the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
The Spanish government will place bat detection devices in strategic locations in the park to track the activities of the common bat.
The Spanish team will also be using the mobile devices to collect data on the spread of the virus.
The Spanish team will analyze the sounds that are captured in the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the common bat and what species make them.
The data will be analyzed and mapped to create a detailed image of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, expects the results to reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they use them each species.
The data collected will be used to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of shelters and how to maintain forests for the bat and other associated species.
The population of the common bat in Scotland has been in decline for some time.
The threat of extinction is under threat by the construction and development that threatens their nests and the loss of their habitat.
The wind turbines and the electrical wiring can also be a threat to them, as is the use of insecticide and other chemical treatments of building materials or the attacks of domestic cats.

With a video on Instagram Live that has already amassed 142 million followers after being published a few hours after the news broke, Ronaldo, 33, tweeted that the report was "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What have they said today is false.
I want to be famous.
The same old story of always.
I want to be famous, but I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
I am a happy man and everything is fine.
The lawyers of Ronaldo are preparing a legal action against Der Spiegel for the publication of a report that they consider to be untrue and unfair.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will seek damages for "moral damage" for the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in the last years.
Según parece, el supuesto incidente tuvo lugar en junio de 2009 en una suite del Palms Hotel and Casino en Las Vegas.
Después de conocerse en un club nocturno, supuestamente, Ronaldo y Mayorga fueron a la habitación del jugador y allí él, presuntamente, la violó analmente, según los documentos registrados en el Tribunal del Distrito del Condado de Clark en Nevada.
Mayorga declared that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and said that he was 99 percent a good guy and that the one percent he had deceived was the "one percent" that wasn't.
In the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.

Brexit: the UK would regret losing carmakers
The UK would regret losing its position as the world’s leading carmaker if it left the EU, said Greg Clark.
Toyota UK said it was "very concerned" that the UK would leave the EU without a deal, and that production would be temporarily halted at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
We need a deal
The manufacturer of the world’s largest automotive parts supplier, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, has warned that the impact of a no-deal Brexit would be a major threat to the company’s global supply chain.
La planta de Burnaston, que fabrica modelos Auris y Avensis de Toyota, produjo unos 150 000 coches el año pasado, de los cuales se exportó un 90 % al resto de la Unión Europea.
"If Britain breaks away from the EU in March, there will be production stops at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, director general of Toyota in Burnaston.
El fabricante de automóviles japonés Honda ha advertido de que la salida de la Unión Europea sin un acuerdo comercial podría dañar la economía británica.
Spanish: 
The main concerns of the automotive manufacturers are the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is based on the just in time production method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the 29th of March the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal, there could be a border disruption that could cause delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would be unable to accommodate the quantity of material equivalent to more than a day’s inventory in its Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in such a case, production would be halted
The UK's chief negotiator for Brexit, David Frost, said Theresa May's Chequers plan is "calibrated to avoid the controls at the border".
"We need a deal. We need a good deal. We need to have the best deal that we can get. We have to have the best deal that we can get. We have to take advantage of the opportunity."
"The evidence of Toyota, among other things, is that we have to be able to continue with the success of our supply chain. We have to be able to continue with the success of our supply chain".
Toyota no ha sido capaz de decir durante cuánto tiempo se detendría la producción, pero advirtió de que, a largo plazo, los costes adicionales reducirían la competitividad de la planta y, en última instancia, los costes.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite shop steward at the plant, said his members were becoming increasingly concerned: "As employment loses out, so does the job".
Un portavoz del gobierno dijo: "Hemos puesto en marcha un plan preciso y convincente en el que se delimitan nuestras futuras relaciones con la UE".
Trump Meeting with Rosenstein May Be Delayed
The White House said the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein, which was scheduled for the weekend, would be delayed "one week" because of the ongoing dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump's ties to Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump.
The Trump administration is expecting to dismiss Mueller, who has been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, to avoid a political firestorm.
A principios de este mes, el New York Times informó de que Rosenstein grabó las conversaciones que mantuvo con Trump con un micrófono que él mismo llevaba para tratar de relegar al presidente mediante la 25.ª enmienda.

When asked about the meeting, Rosenstein said: "We have not yet decided on a date, but we could be considering it this week or the next."
We will be deciding on the date and the press on the day of the announcement.
Some Spanish journalists would refute that assertion:

"The president does more question and answer sessions than any other president before him", said, and cited no evidence: "We have verified these numbers".
The press conferences will continue, but if the press has the option to ask directly to the president of the United States, I think it's much better than having me ask them.
We've tried it many times and you've seen it many times before, and you've seen it many times in the last few weeks, so we're trying to do it again, and we're trying to do it again. We're trying to do it again.
Trump usually answers questions when he is in the White House or when he participates in public or private events.

To foreigners, a higher transmission tax will be levied when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to give shelter to the homeless
The Conservative Party is a political party in the United Kingdom.

The increase in the UK's corporation tax will be imposed on those who do not pay corporation tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120m a year to fund homelessness
The additional money that is raised by the increase in the land tax on foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help homeless people, announced today by Theresa May.
The measure is understood as a way of neutralising the success that is enjoying Jeremy Corbyn with his promises to provide affordable housing for young voters and to target the rich.
The increase in the land transmission tax will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK and that money will be used to encourage the government to combat the problem of homelessness on the streets.
The recargo, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, also included in the last two years, will be increased to levels that were introduced in 2010 on second hand houses and the "buy-to-let" system, it could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120m a year with this change

The heatwave of the summer has pushed the bars and clubs in the UK to a standstill, but the bars and clubs in Spain are still open.
The Spanish pub and bar industry saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, while the restaurants dropped by 4.8%.
The British Pub Association, which compiles the figures, said the pubs had a record-breaking July, with a 2.8% increase in their profits, while the restaurants were down by about a third.
Spanish: 
The number of bars and pubs that serve mainly alcoholic beverages had their strongest month, while the majority of restaurants saw a decline in their earnings.
The restaurants that serve primarily food also suffered from the heat, but not as much as the pubs that serve mainly drinks.
It seems people only want to drink.
In the pubs and bars managed, sales of spirits rose by 6.6% during the month, while food sales dropped by 3.3%.
Paul Newman, the analysts of hospitality and leisure of RSM said: "These results follow the trend we've seen from the end of April.
The weather and the impact of sporting events or social events of very important importance are still the most important factors in the sales of activities outside the home market.
The Spanish restaurant industry is still struggling, although the decline in sales from the year before will be particularly painful in view of the continuing pressure on costs.
The long and hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for the food and drink operators and the weather is telling us that the cool temperatures that we have had in August will provide the relief that we need.
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7% in July, reflecting the slower decline in new restaurant openings.

A Spanish company has divided opinion in the public eye with a controversial advertisement where they compare breastfeeding to milking cows.
Para marcar el lanzamiento de lo que en teoría es el "primer sacaleches silencioso del mundo", la empresa de tecnología para el consumidor Elvie publicó un anuncio inspirado en un vídeo con música algo irónica donde se muestra a unas madres que cuentan la libertad que les da el nuevo extractor de leche.
Four real women dance in a hay barn full of hay, along with some cows, with lyrics like: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Maybe I'm not really a cow, but my breasts are my breasts".
The chorus continues to say: "Ordénalas, ordénalas, estoy ordeñando a mis mujeres".
Spanish: 
Spanish: 
A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
The Spanish have to be pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, with the exception of that they have to take their babies away from them days after they give birth.
The Elvie Breast Extractor is a discreetly placed breast pump (Elvie/Mother).
Another traumatic experience for the mother and the baby.
But, do you think that I'm crazy?
Another comment was: “Another crazy ad. 

English: 
Sin embargo, otras personas defendieron el anuncio, como una mujer que admitía que la canción le resultaba “desternillante”.

The ad is a little weird, but I don't give it more thought.
It’s a great idea.

In the ad, Spanish: 
Spanish: 
The campaign is based on the perception that many women who use the pump say they feel like cows.
Sin embargo, la Elvie Pump es totalmente silenciosa, no tiene cables ni tubos, y se acopla discretamente dentro del sujetador de lactancia, lo que hace que sus usuarias puedan moverse, sujetar a sus bebés e incluso salir a la calle con la bomba en funcionamiento.
Spanish: 
We wanted to show the parallel between the expressive cows and the milkmaids, what we wanted to do was to call attention to the use of the breast pumps and its challenges, while also demonstrating the incredible sensation of freedom that breastfeeding brings.

The number of illegal immigrants detained has experienced a dramatic increase, despite the monthly flow of illegal immigrants into the border area having remained at the usual levels.
The Spanish-language version of the program is called "Padres de Familia".
The number of illegal aliens in the United States has increased by more than 300,000 in the past year, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
La semana pasada, Matthew Albence, un alto cargo de la Oficina de Inmigración y Aduanas, testificó ante el Congreso que la agencia había arrestado docenas de personas que solicitaron apadrinar a menores no acompañados.
The arrested suspects included a man who was arrested in connection with the murder of a woman in the Dominican Republic.
“The number of illegal aliens in the United States is around 80% of the total population.
We are still pursuing these people.
The new rules require that children under 16 who are arrested for the first time must appear in court within a month, rather than the previous 60 days, according to workers at the children's centres
Many of them will testify by video conferencing, rather than in person, before a judge to defend their legal status.
The ones who are not fit for the shelter will be deported as soon as possible.
The report also concluded that the children should be returned to their families as soon as possible.
Según comentan los defensores, estas preocupaciones aumentan aún más en instalaciones más grandes, como la de Tornillo, donde es más probable que, debido a su tamaño, se pasen por alto los indicios de malestar en estos niños.

Syria requests US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops from Syria
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has called on the Syrian government to allow the return of refugees to their homes.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualem says that the US-led intervention in Syria is illegal and that the US is trying to cover up its role in the country.
“The government must withdraw from the area and withdraw from the area,” said the UN Secretary General.
Moualem insisted that the “terrorist war in Syria is practically over” and that “more than 360,000 people have died in the war and millions have been displaced.”
Syrian president Bashar al-Assad said today that the Syrian army would continue to fight against terrorism in the country until the complete elimination of terrorist groups.
Estados Unidos tiene unos 2.000 soldados en Siria, principalmente proporcionando formación y asesoramiento a las fuerzas kurdas y árabes de Siria que se oponen al presidente Bashar al-Assad.
Spain has more than 1,000 soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Moualem said that refugees should be allowed to return and blamed “some western countries” for “spreading irrational fears” that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
“We have requested international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these repatriations.”
“They are politicizing a humanitarian issue”.
Syria: U.S. and EU warn Assad to stop fighting, but not help rebuild until political agreement is reached.
The UN Security Council has said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib province is a chance to force political talks.
Turkey and Russia sign historic agreement to stop Syrian rebels from crossing into Turkey
Moualem has also said that the agreement had clear “time frames” and expressed hope that the military action will be focused on the jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will be “eradicated”.
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, expects to convene soon new UN committee to draft a new constitution for Syria and to facilitate elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the committee should be limited to reviewing the current constitution.

The money flows in the midterm elections
No es una sorpresa la afluencia de dinero que está llegando al distrito 17 de Pensilvania, gracias a la reestructuración de un distrito del Congreso con dos candidatos que buscan la reelección para el mismo escaño.
Este distrito residencial de Pittsburg, cuya estructura se rediseño recientemente, tiene al representante demócrata Conor Lamb, que ganó su escaño en otro distrito en una elección especial la pasada primavera.
Lamb se enfrenta a otro candidato para reelección, el republicano Keith Rothfus, que actualmente representa el antiguo distrito 12 de Pensilvania, un distrito que se solapa en gran medida con el nuevo 17.
The maps were redrawn after a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in January that the old districts had been illegally drawn in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a financing battle between the main campaign financing arms of the parties, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Republican National Committee (RNC).
El nombre de Lamb se hizo muy familiar en Pensilvania después de una estrecha victoria en una elección especial celebrada en marzo para el Distrito del Congreso 18 de Pensilvania.
The district was held by a Republican for more than a decade.

The Rangers will play their home game on Thursday against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify in the Group G of the Europa League.
Graham Dorrans, who was injured in the knee in the last game, made his first appearance of the season in the 2–2 draw with Villarreal.
“We managed to get a good point, because Villarreal is a good team”, said the midfielder.
We started the game believing we could do something and we ended up with a draw.
I think we could have won, but we couldn't achieve the victory.
They were better in the first half, but after the break they came back stronger.
This weekend we have a great European night.
I hope we can achieve a good result, but it will be a tough game because they already won a good result in the last game. But, with our supporters behind us, we can achieve a good result and obtain a positive result.
The year was a tough one for me. I had a lot of injuries and changes in the club, but now everything is back to normal.
The team is feeling great, the kids are enjoying themselves and they are having a great training.
I have the hope that we can overcome the past season and achieve success.
The fear of retirement is making women sleep in the night
A pesar del hecho de que los participantes de la encuesta tenían una idea clara de cómo querían que se les atendiera, son pocas las personas hablan de esto con sus familiares.

Los fiscales federales de Nueva York están buscando la pena capital para Sayfullo Saipov, el sospechoso del ataque terrorista de la ciudad de Nueva York que mató a ocho personas, un castigo excepcional que no se ha ejecutado en el estado por un delito federal desde 1953.
Spanish: 
To justify a death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed “intentionally” eight people and caused “intentionally” serious bodily injury, according to the request for a request for the death penalty, filed in the District Court of the Southern District of New York.
Spanish: 
Varias semanas después del ataque, un gran jurado federal presentó una acusación de 22 cargos que incluían ocho cargos de asesinato con ayuda de crimen organizado, que suelen utilizar los fiscales federales en estos casos, y un cargo de violencia y destrucción de vehículos motorizados.
The prosecution said the attack required “a plan and premeditated plan of attack”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, a U.S. citizen, planned and carried out the attacks on December 26, 2012, in New York City and Washington, D.C. He was arrested in the aftermath of the attacks and charged with terrorism.
Spanish: 
Spanish: 
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately acquitted of murder in 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty was carried out in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Spanish: 
I was feeling fine.
The FBI said Saipov, who was arrested in New York, was inspired by ISIS videos.
Spanish: 
Spanish: 
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represent Saipov, said he was “deeply disappointed” with the decision of the prosecutor’s office.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea with a sentence of life without possibility of release, only prolongs the trauma of these events for all the people involved.”
The prosecution requested that the death penalty be imposed on Saipov.

Nigel Farage promised to mobilise the popular army today during a protest conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians should “feel the heat” of the euro-sceptics, while one of the MPs in Theresa May’s government suggested that he should be in charge of the talks with the EU.
The Conservative Party’s Brexit campaign is a disaster.
Pero el desafío al que se enfrenta la Primera Ministra May para reconciliar sus divididas filas ha destacado aún más cuando un grupo de Tories a favor de la permanencia se han unido a una protesta opuesta contra el Brexit en la ciudad.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Brexit deal standing in the face of the opposition from both the Leave and Remain camps and the European Union
The allies insisted on trying to reach a compromise with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their plan and chaos.
The Conservative Party is not going to support the plan.
Spanish: 
If he had been in charge, we would have left.
Este Miembro del Parlamento por Wellingborough añadió: “Voy a defender el Brexit, pero tenemos que deshacernos de Chequers”.
We have fought in wars to be free.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Britain’s Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the country’s decision to leave the EU was “irreversible” and that the government would not reverse the result.
La primera ministra Theresa May, escuche al pueblo.
The public at large does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition does not support it and it is unpopular with our activists, who are the ones who actually get out and vote for us first.

The president Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein’s insistence that he did not leak the Christine Blasey Ford letter in which she accused Brett Kavanaugh of rape.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, President Obama did not mention the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he did say that what happened in the Senate showed that there was “bad, repugnant, and false people”.
“The only thing that could possibly happen and what is good that is happening these last days in the Senate, is when you see the rage, when you see people who are bad, reprehensible and false.”
“When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say “But if I did not do it,”


I don’t know why I did it.
¿Lo recordáis?
Spanish: 
I’m sorry, I didn’t read the question.
Oh, no.
I don’t want to be a spy.
Well, wait a minute.
We have filtered it out, but we have not edited it.
A Feinstein le enviaron la carta en la que se detallaban las acusaciones contra Kavanaugh por parte de Ford en julio y se filtró a principios de septiembre, pero Feinstein negó que la filtración viniera de su oficina.
“I did not hide the allegations of the Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to the Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I did so.
But his reaction to the gesture was not well received by the crowd.
Spanish: 
Continuing with his defense of the nominee of the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations against the nominee for their own ends.
Their aim is to recover the power of the people.
You see evil and repulsion, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to obtain power and control.

We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to bring him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Spanish: 
Our hearts break when we hear this
The Indonesian government is afraid that the number of dead could reach several thousand people.
“The number of deaths is expected to increase, as there were still many bodies under the rubble and it is not possible to reach out to many people”, says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
A wave that reached six meters high has devastated Palu, which is celebrating a funeral for the victims.
The Spanish Government is sending aid and supplies by air and by commercial ships.
Spanish: 
The water is scarce.
The Spanish mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross is trying to help all survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there”
This is a very sad story, but it could have been much worse.
The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the army: “We’re all working together to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are they ready?”, reported CNN.
Indonesia has been hit by a series of earthquakes in the past few months.

The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.

The passenger jet landed safely.
That’s a good thing,” said Jaynes.

Exhibió ante el jurado la forma en que usó los registros de telefonía móvil para encadenar los movimientos de Quinton Tellis, el acusado de 29 años, y Jessica Chambers, la víctima de 19 años, la noche en que esta murió.
Rowlett said he received the location data of several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his earlier statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with him, the police talked to Sanford.
Spanish: 
Cuando los fiscales preguntaron si Tellis decía la verdad cuando dijo que estaba en la camioneta de Sanford esa noche, Sanford dijo que estaba “mintiendo, porque mi camioneta estaba en Nashville”.
Otra inconsistencia fue que Tellis dijo que había conocido a Chambers aproximadamente dos semanas antes de su muerte.
The Spanish government has accused the Catalan government of trying to create a new state, but the Catalan government has denied the accusation.
Rowlett said that in some way after Chambers' death, Tellis erased the messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers' phone.
“The Devil’s Double Cross”, said the Devil.
The defense is scheduled to argue his case on Monday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be completed by noon.

A Spanish nanny sues a couple for firing after posting racist tweet
Una niñera de Nueva York va a demandar a una pareja por despido discriminatorio después de recibir equivocadamente un mensaje de texto de la madre quejándose de que era “otra persona negra”.
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the case to a “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her shock at discovering that the new daycare employee, Giselle Maurice, was black at her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Spanish: 
After discovering his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, saying he was “incómoda” and that his previous nanny, an African American, had done a bad job.
Spanish: 
Mauricio está ahora demandando a la pareja por una compensación por el despido con intención de recibir una compensación de 350 dólares al día por la posición de seis meses de trabajo interno para la que se le había contratada, aunque sin un contrato.
“I want to show them that things are not done like that”, said the president to the press on Friday and added “I know that it is discrimination”.
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racists by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable thing to do, as they feared that she would not be able to trust them again after she had insulted them.
My wife sent me a note.
She is not racist.
We are not racists,” said husband Joel Plasco to Post.

Comparing the demand as an extortion, Plasco said his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a “very difficult” situation.
“¿Vas a ir por alguien de esa manera?
That’s not a decent thing to do.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion has already begun to criticize the couple for their behavior and their logic.

My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was on a state visit to the Mediterranean island of Cyprus when his plane crashed.
“Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he didn’t expect to succeed.”
“I was in the hospital for a couple of days and I was told that she was going to die in two minutes.
And so I did it.
I love you, Tashi.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The doctors had given him medication to keep his heart beating.
She had died before the sun was up.
I couldn’t sit there and wait, knowing that everything was happening.
I couldn't howl, cry, or moan, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep my head up.
Finally, the lady Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering for the loss of her daughter, embarked on the plane together with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was about to endure.
“No one knew”, said.
I was so sad and so sad.
It was difficult to explain, but it was in the flight that I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved you.

Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent other people from jumping off.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and numbers to which people can call to request help.
Tyler, the Daughter of the Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day”, said.
Davis, de 45 años de edad y que vive en Lydney, dijo que su hijo era un chef prometedor con una sonrisa contagiosa.
“All knew him by his smile.”
I was always told that his smile brightened any place.
Sin embargo, dejó el trabajo antes de morir, ya que se encontraba “en un lugar realmente oscuro”.
En 2014, el hermano de Tyler, que tenía 11 años en ese momento, fue quien lo encontró después de haberse quitado la vida.
The Spanish Ambassador said: “I am very concerned that the Spanish Government is not doing enough to help us.”
Spanish: 
Don't be afraid to talk about it.
The Spanish Mrs. Humphreys, who is a friend of Davies's for years, lost her partner Mark, her partner with whom she had been 15 years, after the death of her mother.
“I don’t think I’m depressed, I’m just feeling down,” he says.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed his change of attitude.
The day of Christmas arrived, and the children opened their presents, and he did not even look at them.
He was a great friend of mine.
He has left us brokenhearted.
But we have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance of a thread
“I thought we could get something like what we were asking (a limited time, scope limited investigation), perhaps we could bring a little bit of unity”, Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “slipping away” in the middle of a partisan impasse.

Five weeks from the midterm elections, November 6, 2018. If Republicans have a bad showing, their efforts to elect the man they want to be the Supreme Court's chief justice will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling on the Senate, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House.
What happens when the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Todavía no está claro si Kavanaugh podrá obtener al menos 50 votos en el Senado, lo que le permitiría al vicepresidente Mike Pence romper el empate y confirmarlo para el Tribunal Supremo.

The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said there were 1,127 desertions in 2012, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
The North Korean government has been accused of using the deaths of hundreds of people to extract money from China.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the issue.
The vast majority of deserters from the north who have been offered South Korean citizenship have accepted it.
South Korea says it has crossed illegally into North Korea's territory more than 30,000 North Koreans since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the DMZ.
China considers illegal immigrants to be refugees rather than refugees
The relationship between the North and the South, which has been technically at war for the last few months, has improved considerably in the last few months.
The two countries met in Pyongyang in early April to discuss the ongoing nuclear talks.
El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, y el líder de Corea del Norte, Kim Jong-un, se reunieron en Singapur el martes para discutir la desnuclearización de la península de Corea.

“Only one thing: if he is lying to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court in which he is now sitting.”
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi agregó que, como demócrata, le preocupaban las posibles sentencias de Kavanaugh contra la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible o el Caso Roe contra Wade, ya que se considera que es un juez conservador.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about Supreme Court decisions.

The tears are allowed because they are a way to get out anger.
One of the clearest memories I have from my first job, in a workplace dominated by men, was one time I was crying with a rage that I had never expressed before. A woman older, a manager who I had always had a slight fear of, grabbed me by the nape of my neck and dragged me up the stairs.

China y Estados Unidos se enfrentan en una guerra comercial
The first round of trade war between the United States and China was loud and unexpected, and although the battle is still ongoing, a breakdown in the battle could benefit Beijing, opinion experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant new tax increase this week was a new $200 billion (150 billion pounds) in tariffs on 200,000 million (150,000 million pounds) of imports, which charges half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
The United States has retaliated by imposing a 25 percent duty on imports of Chinese goods, and a 10 percent duty on imports of Chinese goods.
China has committed to a number of measures to counteract the United States' trade barriers.
China's military is not going to be held back by the United States.
China's economy is the largest in the world, and the world's largest economy by a wide margin.
“The possibility of a Chinese economic collapse is much more dangerous than the possibility of a U.S. economic collapse,” said Abigail Grace, a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security.
