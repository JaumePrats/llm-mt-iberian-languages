As of today, there is no evidence that any drug is effective in treating the existing infection caused by Ebola, even though there is an experimental vaccine that appears to be capable of reducing the mortality rate caused by that disease.
Zmapp, a combination of antibodies, had a promising early result in the field, but formal studies showed that it was less effective than expected in preventing death.
In the essay PALM, the function of Zmapp was as a control, i.e. that the scientists used it as a base and compared it with the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the statement of the US Olympic Committee and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family create a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We coincided with the USOC's statement that the interests of the athletes, clubs, and sports can be better served if we advance with significant changes within our organization, rather than the withdrawal of certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that may shed light on how Larry Nassar's abuse could have gone undetected for so long and accepts any changes that may be necessary and appropriate.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and the USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a protected, positive, and enhanced environment.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that's already widely accepted, the study also offers specific data that fossils generally don't, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this bird has a reddish-brown upper plumage and a pale or carotenoid lower plumage.
In addition, the discovery helps us to understand better the evolution of bird feathers.
Given that the plumage of dinosaurs lacks a well-developed axis, called a ravisher, but does have other features of feathers (quills and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that the ravisher is probably the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but to regulate body temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a hatchling.
The experts' comments were that, even though it's the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a hatchling.
In the morning of yesterday, in Gaziantep, Turkey, a car bomb killed two police officers and wounded more than twenty other people.

It was discovered that the sun was ruled by the same basic principles as other stars: the only factors that impelled its activity within the system were its luminosity and its rotation.
The intensity of the light and the rotation are combined to calculate the number of Rossby of a star, linked to the plasma flow.
A smaller number of Rossby, the smaller is the star's magnetic activity in relation to its magnetic inversions.

It contains 78 recommendations, of which the number one is the adoption of a new initiative before the end of the year with the purpose of protecting the borders of Iraq from hostile operations and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who currently holds the position of senator and is the first lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city located 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will run for president.
The Teatro Argentino was the place where Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president; this is the same place where she began her campaign for the Senate in 2005, in representation of the province of Buenos Aires.
The issue that gave rise to the debate was the controversy surrounding the budget earmarked for relief and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina, a measure that some conservative fiscal hawks tagged around in jest as the "New Orleans Agreement of Bush".
The criticisms of the liberals in relation to the works of restoration have their focus on the fact that they have been awarded reconstruction contracts to people who, apparently, are Washington bureaucrats.

Although it was a highly theoretical work, the program was written with the purpose of simulating the observations made to the galaxy of Sagittarius.
It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would be responsible for the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the galaxy of Sagittarius in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes the tides.
The experts came to the conclusion that dark matter interacts with normal matter in the same way that normal matter interacts with normal matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy is located in a class of halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

The extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was detected for the first time by Dr. Tony Moll in South Africa's Zululandia.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant was "generating a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate".
The doctor Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of the infected were health workers at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can spread the disease to between 10 and 15 people with whom he or she has had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total number of TB patients still seems to be relatively low: 6000 of a total of 333 000 TB patients in a particular moment in South Africa.

Pigs are the carriers of the disease, which then migrates to humans via mosquitos.
The outbreak has led authorities in India to adopt measures such as the deployment of pig hunters, the distribution of millions of mosquito nets to the population, and the use of pesticides in the most affected areas.
The authorities have also guaranteed several millions of doses of the vaccine to fight against encephalitis, which will allow the health companies to prepare for the next year.
This year, a shortage of financial resources and a lack of prioritization, compared with other diseases, have led to delays in the execution of the vaccination plans in historically vulnerable regions.
In 1956, Słania moved to Sweden, where, after three years, he managed to get a job in the Swedish postal service and there he became Chief engraver.
The number of stamps he produced, both for Sweden and for the other 28 nations, exceeds 1,000.

In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are sequestered in a cubicle and fill out a pre-printed ballot that indicates the candidate they've chosen.
After confirming the voter's identity, the voter enters the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter's list.
The French electoral law sets out the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, which allows voters and observers to verify that there are no extra ballots at the start of voting and that no additional ballots are added that are not those of those voting, properly counted and authorized.
The candidates have the right to send representatives to oversee each stage of the process and, during the night, the volunteers count the votes under a rigorous supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

“I lost my sister and her friend, and when I got back, I saw two people in wheelchairs and everyone was jumping over them and pushing them around,” Versace recalled.
In addition, NHK reported that the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in the prefecture of Niigata was operating normally.
Hokuriku Electric Power Co declared that the earthquake did not cause any incidents and that the reactors 1 and 2 of its Shika nuclear power plant were shut down.
It was reported that around 9,400 homes in the region are without water supply and around 100 without electricity.
Some routes were damaged, train service was disrupted in the affected areas, and the airport in Noto, in Ishikawa prefecture, remains closed.
A bomb was detonated at the door of the governor-general's office.
Three more bombs were detonated in the immediate vicinity of government buildings in a two-hour period.
Although there are reports that the official death toll is eight and the authorities have confirmed that around 30 people were injured, the official death toll is still unknown.
They found high concentrations of cyanide and melamine in the urine samples of animals that died after eating contaminated pet food.
The researchers indicated that the two compounds react with each other to give rise to crystals that can obstruct the renal function.
The experts detected the formation of crystals in the urine of the cats, due to the incorporation of melamine and cyanuric acid.
When compared through the use of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), it could be determined that the composition of the crystals coincides with that found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if they've noticed this or not, but most of the products coming from Central America to this country were duty-free.
Even so, the countries of Central America imposed tariffs on 80% of the products we manufacture. We treat you like that.
It didn't make sense to me; it definitely wasn't fair.
The only thing I tell people is that you treat us the same way we treat you.
A bill was proposed by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, that would ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill proposes that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take over the post of business minister that Davey is leaving vacant.
The 16th of February is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, both 25 and 21 years old, died. Cuddeback was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon jammed as he aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, can only see with one of his eyes, and part of his skull is missing. His face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via a video link from a U.S. Air Force base in his country of origin.
Carpanedo took part in two individual races in addition to the Wednesday competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he got a "Did not finish the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished 10th in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four skiers in the Giant Slalom category failed to complete their races, and a total of 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the next round.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh was able to recover the laptop and the mobile phone that were stolen.
The deputy inspector general, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the superintendent of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused presented themselves before the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services extricated the driver of the red Audi TT.
In the beginning, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on trial in the Court of the County of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she's under house arrest awaiting trial, any eyewitness testimony can be questioned, since her image has been widely disseminated.
It's a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said: "Journalists seem to be walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is in charge of the processing, said it would not make any further comments until the auto-prosecution is issued.
According to the information that was leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the pre-1967 borders.
Other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations regard as sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA only agrees to five.
During the complementary control of pests, the game wardens had to supervise the shooters closely, given that they were being monitored and evaluated for their effectiveness.
In a partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales Association of Sporting Shooters (NSW), volunteers were recruited from within the Association of Sporting Shooters.
Mick O'Flynn, who's in charge, provisionally, of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS, noted that a full training and safety briefing was given to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, he's the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the generalized protests that began in October against the regime.
The protests, at times violent, were sparked by the fact that no elections have been held, in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 cases of iPods have been reported with problems of malfunctioning and overheating, which have caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "non-serious".
The ministry pronounced itself in relation to the delay in Apple's report, saying that it was "truly lamentable".
Mariana was jolted by a 7.1-magnitude earthquake at 7:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage on the territory.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country hijacked a bus and held captive tourists who were coming from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 rifle against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took over the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on preterm birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that investigators for the government were able to recover the flight data recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also paid their respects.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Dusty Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as I was; even more so. I love her and I'll miss her. I hope she's in a better place."
Between 2008 and the 2010 federal elections, there was a 8% increase in those opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II had ended.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At the other end of the survey, 29% of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other end, 31% think it should never become a republic.
The winner of the Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle had to swim the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle, and three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt after his complaints.
He hasn't been able to take painkillers to relieve his pain, because their use is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using a variety of hardware and software and it was announced on February 1st.
Perhaps comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of the scientists is to understand how planets are formed, in particular our own, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law that allows people of the same sex to marry.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
It's speculated that he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old technology of ground-based radar, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to the pilots.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the dissuasive measures will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transportation, the possibility was considered that the game would be played behind closed doors, without the fanatics of the team.
On Thursday, the magazine Science reported on a study that informed about the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from the University of Princeton, in the U.S., and from the University of Uppsala, in Sweden, announced that the new species was able to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migratory, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it's also possible to stretch it until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be made very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it can be used to decorate illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of ions of hydrogen (the H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its level of pH.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Thus, a hydrogen ion is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Shake both powders together and, after doing so, with clean hands and moistened hands, express them to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in their hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
In some homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had sanitary facilities in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is making use of a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the light of the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and view that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it's done for us is to make travel much easier and faster.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transportation, such as the railroad or the automobile, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small felids (which include domestic cats) that feed on species of small size that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the big cats that socialize the most, and their lives are spent in large groups known as prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their calves.
In general, females tend to be very close to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behavior as packs of wolves or dogs, with which they share a surprising similarity (unlike the other big cats) in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
A full-fledged athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, dive, and pull five times as hard as a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. If possible, they will hunt monkeys, rodents, birds, and reptiles. Most of their prey will be much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) using their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one of which they are a part (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations that they did in the past.
Over time, as the growing population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that they won't be able to be classified as the same species.
This process receives the name of speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an ineludible and fundamental consequence of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without them, animals wouldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except for other members of its own species.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to another group of teeth in the palate, which means that anything that got in its way, had no chance of escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and even could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a Tyrannosaurus Rex was a threat to it.
Although most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails, and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that distinguished them was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the well-to-do enjoyed sharing banquets and reclining while they ate.
It's impossible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
In short, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no chocolate, and no Romans of antiquity ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be their home.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests sought to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
At other times, they built special towers with a pyramidal shape, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't of much importance.
The Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only showrooms that faced the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; as a result, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him more westward, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to his discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
While each of the Scandinavian countries was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you might think that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it's not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Independence original of July 4, 1776". The text is written on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although we don't know for sure who wrote it, it's known that the huge document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it's likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out on D-Day, as well as the subsequent battles, had achieved the liberation of the north of France, the south still remained.
His government was in the hands of the Vichy French, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon began, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
You can define a civilization as a specific culture that forms part of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term "civilization" derives from the Latin civilis, which means "civil", and is related to the word civis, from the same language, which means "citizen", as well as civitas, which means "city" or "city-state" and which, in addition, determines the size of the society.
State capitals are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy, and a homogenous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilisations in their own right.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, given that it lacked a national executive or judicial branch, this function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate in order to enforce all of its laws.
He was also not empowered to annul laws or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second-most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most popular are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions of the country, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
There are about 7,000 islands in Japan, the largest of which is Honshu, which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European mariners who sailed through the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means "beautiful island".
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal and western regions of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this last as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see what they looked like originally.
By 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
To illustrate, the most common format for fixed-lens photography around the world is 35mm, which was the size of film most commonly used towards the end of the era of film photography.
Today it's still being produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship has been transferred to the image sensors of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35mm format is confusing, as its measurements are 36mm wide by 24mm tall.
For this reason, it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest rational number) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g., the APS format) are similar or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing for a certain order in the images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the commoner.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church should be reserved for that specific purpose.
The central cupola of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Not long after the hostilities began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognized international legal principle and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even putting at risk the safety of neutral ships.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would find a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Over the course of the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with four cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody civil war broke out among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
It's the same with the military, since now they're based on merit rather than class.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured in time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the peak of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, lies a cave that is totally cut off from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it's very difficult to find, even if one was sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains in the vicinity. From the interior of this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the Seven Wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The "upward arrow" mark is similar to a V and the "downward arrow" mark is similar to a grapheme or a square without its lower border.
Above means to start at the tip and push the bow, and below means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, while a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on stringed instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and his sister-in-law, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob that shouted and threw threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage all the way.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a executed guard in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people paid the costs of the imperialism of the U.S. in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial government of the U.S. with the purpose of paying the majority of the government's expenses and interest on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From the outset, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it's necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in which these events take place is known as the High Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The determinism of technology is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from the impulse or imperative of technology to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and how it relates to the laws of science and how they're embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on a path independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of highways is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also leads to a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in the Romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded people and, with the passage of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered as such in the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 B.C. and extended until around 1100 A.D.
During the twelfth century its status declined, especially due to the fact that, upon his return, the Crusaders brought back expensive gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was then transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the form of dress received great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, the Western styles could take a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of its own. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
We understand subsistence agriculture as that which aims to produce enough food to feed only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of indigenous seeds stored in the region's ecoregion with the rotation of crops and other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, most of the principal activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality due to social standards and provides them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It's common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic traits of their belonging by using distinctive and symbolic styles, such as fashion, gestures, and slang.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for graphing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, bad luck, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It's possible that the feral children may have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It's said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical capabilities) almost equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though the project-based learning should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, an assistance that provides support to those who are going through a new experience, such as the use of a new software program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented either in a real or virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also is the small animated sticky note in Microsoft Office.
Augmented reality features are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate, or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand on their own.
It welcomes children into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care, or education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family-based foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education, and reliable medical care.
The objective of the foster home is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home from which the child was removed.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and communication between people.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the point of view of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
In a study of users' reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "participation" and "durability" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it's claimed that, by reading a person's microexpressions, it's possible to detect if they're lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", explained how those who can't understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of the speaker with precision.
He even suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes that variation from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination barter the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it's not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as a human's, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the resources available in the vegetation.
In fact, not doing so can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have constituted the simplest source of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digested by primates such as us, except when cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all of the essential amino acids.
In the end, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
The interruption of sleep consists of waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved easily with a more or less gentle alarm clock that will return him to a conscious state without waking him completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you'll have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we contend. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in our way is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they have extended through the path of loving-kindness Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, the kundalini yoga is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy Kundalini (illumination) is activated with yoga poses, breathing practices, mantras, or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. By visualizing different deities, the channels of energy can be unblocked, chakras can be activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. When the war ended, the clashes of system, process, and culture led to the distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who had been allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that for the 17th of September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian head of the bridge.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The campaign of the North Atlantic in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, employing mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this traffic.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it had done with the other European countries.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
With the aim of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat, and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes began to hunt them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasture, tended by herdsmen who were often children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, railways had already been installed by the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carriages were made of simple parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and haul heavier loads than they could on the rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place occurred quite early on. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper surfaces.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with wheels made of iron, and in 1767, iron rails were used for the first time.
The first form of transportation that was known was walking. Man began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, didn't have the habit of walking upright.
While fossils of bipedal Australopithecus have been found as far back as 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it's possible that Sahelanthropus was walking on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more amicably with the planet, join environmentalist movements, or even become activists and fight to lessen, in some way, the suffering of the future.
It's, in many cases, like the asintomatic treatment. But if we're not just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It's obvious that the world has undergone great changes, due to the technological and scientific advances of the human race, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, and his assistant, Charles Thomson, a few blocks away.
Approximately 150 to 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who read the Declaration of Independence for the first time, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On the 6th of July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on the 9th of July. On the 10th of August, another copy arrived in London.
Dunlap's 25 photographs, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They're birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs, and move on their hind legs like the Tyrannosaurus.
Currently, almost all computers function in base to the manipulation of data coded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are the 0 and the 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
The internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be finding a bottle of medicine or cleaning chemicals open.
Read the label for specific information about the first aid specific to that venomous species.
The entomologists use the term "parasitic insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with chinches, a species very developed to parasitize humans.
The bedbugs and the clothesbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. is estimated to be around 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, a union of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from EM.
A couple might conclude that raising a child wouldn't be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The goal of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific investigations.
However, it is not an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide the scientific investigation.
The focus of naturalists as well as philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, in the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those on science and psychology, were widely accepted.
As the dominance of the Greek language was waning, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in the behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining manner and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the ADN consisted of a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They carried out two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA of the frog with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether it involves germinal cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks, and study of information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take photographs, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns in their cars to go to their jobs, and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are located in the place from which they just came.
In this dynamic launch vehicle, everyone is somehow connected with a transportation system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive economy of carbon has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the last two million years.
They're all part of society and use the transportation systems; and almost all of them complain about them.
In developed countries, it's rare to hear complaints about the quality of drinking water or the collapse of bridges.
What's the reason that transportation systems give rise to such complaints and why do they fail so often? Are the engineers of transportation simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial going on?
The flow of traffic is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it's not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it's not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of the drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows the traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be approximated by a mathematical representation.
In order to graph more clearly the flow of traffic, relations were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both planning and design as well as the operations of the road vehicles.
The first species to take to the air were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we don't perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon River is the largest river in the world by volume, and the second largest by length.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total amount of water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed those of Guiza, nor in size nor in the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian town of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Italian language is used in the Vatican City, both to draft its legislation and to issue its official communiqués.
The language that the majority of those who work in the state speak on a daily basis is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The total number of citizens who live in the Vatican adheres to the Catholic Church.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper are known since antiquity, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It had a greater resemblance to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, but, at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the Periodic Table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. From the outset, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
It's also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of very small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively diminutive that the period at the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Because of this, when the pencil was invented, it won many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't even need to get close to a pencil.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy car up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, i.e. they tend to disintegrate with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust, and its outer shell is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and of about 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar seas and fatter under the highlands.
It's possible that there are more volcanoes on the side closer to the sea because the crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up until they reached maturity.
These theories analyze what causes some people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there's the attempt to continue being "one of the guys" (or girls).
It's hard for managers in this category to make decisions that don't go over well with their employees, impose disciplinary measures, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities, and demand accountability from their staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it necessary to change everything the group has been doing until now and do it their way.
In the end, the ultimate success or failure of the team is the responsibility of the leader.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Often, the members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
In general, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, since it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones that, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson &amp; LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organization to submit itself to the process of establishing an organization for learning? One of the purposes of applying the concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all of the available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this, it may be possible for an organization that works together to overcome a difficulty in place to innovate a new process in order to meet the needs of customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, the leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge base and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data offer empirical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and make it more precise.
The correlation existing between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time, it's been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with plenty of information and material to develop models of simulation, which help us to understand the mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it's a specialty of great importance within computer science, which is responsible for a machine's behavior, learning, and adaptation.
The research in the field of AI implies the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic queries and customer queries, as well as facial recognition, handwriting recognition, and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-world problems.
The system of Artificial Intelligence is now often used in the sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering, and the military, in the same way that it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study-abroad trips are an important part of any classroom. It's very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that can't be reached by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual tours. The students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as an album of memories.
Blogs can also contribute to improving the writing of students. Even though students usually begin their blogging experience with a grammar and spelling that is not very careful, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Due to the fact that students tend to be the most critical readers, the blogger begins to make an effort to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging requires that students be more understanding of the world around them. The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go deeper in their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics." (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the bewitching bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are more to the south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison of population that causes great surprise to many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we're talking about wild life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France, and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
The Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial influence of Europe and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south, and the Sahara to the west.
Women: It's recommended that all female visitors say they're married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be of use to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it's not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in your rejection of men and don't be afraid to defend your position (there may be cultural differences or not, but that's not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Carthaginians, who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of the White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surrounding area of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of knick-knacks, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the center of the city.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the Kivu province of North.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla-viewing excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To travel within Goma, you can opt to take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with the fact that it's relatively inaccessible, has given Tombuctú the image of an exotic and faraway land.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern corner of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, in each of which a different wild life is developed.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all of South Africa's nature reserves, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It's also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to all the national parks in South Africa or to all the national parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the destination of most tourists who consider it the main attraction.
The skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a graph of illuminated bars, which is evident from the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to Kowloon Bay, which is located in front of it.
It's in the reclaimed lands along the northern coast of Hong Kong where the city's dense urban development is concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. For this reason, if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans to be a World Heritage Site.
Despite this, the forests are not only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wild life and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers in the area and some 30,000 spotted deer.
The buses depart from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those that travel to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it's recommended to buy a ticket with some days of advance.
Most of the districts have the Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cantilever bridge that spans it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there's a free space of 15 meters and, although the construction was completed in August 2011, it wasn't opened for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that is now the eastern part of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers, in addition to practicing subsistence farming.
The region also hosted other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered, and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spaniards started the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous idiosyncrasy and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also watch other tournaments and lower-division games in other parts of the year.
On the website of the Argentine Association of Polo, you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there. It's in front of the store FIC West, in Stanley.
They're usually accepted in any place within the islands. In Stanley, they can also be paid with credit cards or US dollars.
There's a good chance that credit cards won't be accepted on the islands of the periphery, but you might be able to use British or American cash. Ask the owners in advance to find out which method of payment is accepted.

The return current is the flow that recedes from the waves that break on the shore, frequently in a reef or similar.
Because of the submarine topography, the return flow converges in certain areas of greater depth, where it can originate a rapid current with a deep-water direction.
