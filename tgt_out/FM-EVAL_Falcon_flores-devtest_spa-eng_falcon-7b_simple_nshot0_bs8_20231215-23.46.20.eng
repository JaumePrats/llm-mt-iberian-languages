In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plumage, a theory that is already widely accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this animal has a brownish color on the upper part and a pale or carotene color on the lower part.
Moreover, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Since the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called the raxis, but it does have other features of feathers (hairs and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raxis is probably the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but to temperature regulation or as an indicator of the same. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a dinosaur juvenile, the sample analyzed presents the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

The specialists detected the formation of crystals in the urine of the felines, by the incorporation of melamine and cyanuric acid.
By comparing the spectra obtained through the use of FTIR, it was determined that the composition of the crystals coincides with the one found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but most of the products coming from Central America were free of taxes.
Even so, the Central American countries imposed tariffs of eighty percent on the products we manufacture. They treat us like that.
I thought that was unfair; definitely not fair.
All I tell people is that you treat us the way we treat you.
A proposal of law was dictated by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who does not allow to sell or rent violent video games to minors.
The bill requires that video games rated "M" for Mature by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) be labeled with a "M" rating and penalizes the sale of such games to minors with a $1,000 fine.

In the beginning, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to the Addenbrooke Hospital, in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the County Court of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
Although she is under custody awaiting the accusation and the trial, any witness's testimony can be questioned, since her image has been widely diffused.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is in charge of the proceedings, said that it would not make any further comments until the indictment is read out.
According to the information that leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the existing borders prior to the Six-Day War.
Other topics that were also addressed, according to information provided, include the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the complementary control of pests, the game wardens had to supervise the shooters closely, since this was monitored and evaluated.
In a union between NPWS and the Association of NSW Shooters Inc., volunteers were recruited for the Association's shooting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS, pointed out that a comprehensive training and safety course was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the generalized demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were provoked by the fact that elections are not being carried out, in some cases since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunction and overheating have been reported, which have caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple informed them of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry pronounced itself on the delay in the Apple report, saying it was "truly lamentable".
Mariana was shaken by a 7.1-magnitude earthquake at 7:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.

In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, capital of the Philippines, a former police officer of that country hijacked a bus and held hostages, including tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
The six hostages, including children and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old lady because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday the government investigators recovered the black boxes of the crashed plane.
The wrestlers who are Luna's companions also paid tribute to her.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Powder Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as me; even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
From 2008, among the 1400 people surveyed in advance of the 2010 federal elections, there was an 8% increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, the interim prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the Queen's reign ended.
34% of the respondents share this view and want that Isabel II be the last Queen of Australia.
In one end of the survey, 29 % of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, 31 % think it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner in the 100 meter freestyle and 200 meter freestyle had to swim in the freestyle style and three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt after his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers to relieve the pain, because their use is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people checked the discovery by using various types of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of the scientists is to understand how planets are formed, in particular our own, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office at the beginning of the year and the month past he signed a law that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He called the rumors "political babble and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce flight distances, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
Use satellite technology, in contrast with the old technology of radar, with the aim of enabling air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transport will be provided and trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the dissuasive will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered the possibility of playing the game closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the magazine Science reported on a new species of bird that was discovered in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, in the U.S., and from Uppsala University, in Sweden, announced that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated to take much longer, due to the reproduction of a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migratory, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can you hammer and roll into sheets, but you can also stretch it until you get a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it can be used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the juice of cabbage will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product being analyzed determines its pH level.
The atoms of hydrogen are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a proton of hydrogen is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Mix both dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, knead them to form a ball.
A reaction will occur between the moisture in your hands and your external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, there were traces of sewer systems.
They also had sanitary facilities in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and the view that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most relevant thing it has done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster way of transportation.
Thanks to her today we have many means of transport, like the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including domestic cats) that feed on species of small size that exist in much greater abundance, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of his success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the felids that most socialize and their life takes place inside large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family, united with up to thirty females and their calves.
Generally, females relate closely with each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behavior as wolf packs or dogs, with whom they share a surprising similarity (unlike the other great cats) in their behavior and that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The athlete is a tiger, he can climb (but not very well), swim, dive, and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a fully sonorous roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. In most cases, they will hunt monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds. Most of their prey will be much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) through their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark and, in addition, they move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey mimicking their surroundings and then they attack them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
No changes have been made to the original population, which still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As time goes by, as the growing population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will not be able to be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable and fundamental consequence of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, therefore, nothing feared it, except other of its own species.
His long fangs had more than 70 sharp teeth, in addition to another group of teeth in the palate, which translates into anything that passes through his mouth, has no escape.
We don't have the security, but it could have had the viperine. Its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurids and even could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a T. Rex was a threat to him.
Although the majority of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the lizard.
Another thing that distinguished them was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and reclining while eating.
It is impossible that the recipes of the ancient Rome included foods that arrived to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cacao and no Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a central temple considered their home.
The people carried sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy their needs by celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
In some cases, they built special towers with a pyramid shape, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
The Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the patio; the shops were only showrooms that gave onto the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Few people lived in Greenland. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him more westward, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to his discovery, the Eskimos already inhabited the place at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Treasure of the National Map, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Nevertheless, that is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has the text "Declaration of Independence original of July 4, 1776" written on its reverse. The text is written on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that it was not written by a single person, but was compiled, the enormous document (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation has been added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out on D-Day, as well as the subsequent battles, had achieved the liberation of northern France, the south still remained to be liberated.
His government was in the hands of the French Vichy, which was a group that, in 1940, had agreed the peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the "Operation Dragon" was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In only two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a culture that is specific to a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city state, and which, in addition, determines the size of the society.
The states are the precursors of the nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogenous propagation.
The minor cultures usually disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and they are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to fix taxes, and since it was a national executive or judicial power, the function of fixing taxes fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate in order to make sure all of its laws were enforced.
He was not empowered to annul fiscal laws or customs duties between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval of all states for their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions of Spain, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan there are about 7000 islands (the largest one is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, it is usually referred to as Japan as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who were sailing in the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, gave rise to a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labour to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty army took control of the coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex in order to allow tourists to see how they originally looked.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu had been restored and the works are still continuing.
For example, the most common format for a still photograph is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the era of film photography.
Today, it is still produced, but the most important thing is that their dimensional relationship has been transferred to the sensors of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, since its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relation of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest ratio of integers) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS group) are similar or look very much like this relation of appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing for some order to be given to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected all, from the king to the people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church are reserved for that specific function.
The central cupola of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognized international legal principle and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting at risk, even, neutral ships.
Having received a reduced answer against this tactic, Germany thought it would find a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid that situation from happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
Arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way to delimit the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most known was the Three Kingdoms, which developed for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
His many political and social consequences include the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, since, instead of basing the charges of the army on classes, now they are based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the working class who rebelled against their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this life. He often visited a cave which became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured in time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
In the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains in the surroundings. From the inside of this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, raised by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramids of great size and shape built to worship the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids, tombs and temples of this type were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The "arrow up" mark is similar to a V and the "arrow down" mark is similar to a grapheme or a square without its bottom border.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, whereas a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a executed guard in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people paid the expenses of the imperialism of E.E. U.U. in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From the very beginning, the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of profits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in Europe that these events take place in is known as the Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300 (that is, between the years 1000 and 1300 d. C.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The determinism of technology is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and how it is related to the laws of science and how it is embodied in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on its own independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has “effects” on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a reduced number of cars, so new techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to studies by Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography molded people and, with the passing of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to arbitrary laws.
As Paris is known as the city of fashion in the present day, Constantinople was considered as such in the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began approximately in 400 BC and extended until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its status declined, especially due to the fact that, upon their return, the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the way of dressing received great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
Nevertheless, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the western styles could take a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of this period was the use of buttons to fasten garments.
Agriculture of subsistence is that whose objective is to produce enough food to feed only the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds from the region with the rotation of crops and other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, most of the farmers' main activity was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality with respect to the social standards and provides them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic traits of their belonging to this by using distinctive and symbolic styles, such as fashion, gestures and slang.
One of the most common mechanisms for graphically representing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Although the project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new software program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in real or virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also is the small animated subject of Microsoft Office.
The virtual andamiajes are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand by himself.
The children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse, even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our foster care system is to provide safe, loving homes, foster parents, and reliable medical care.
The objective of the family placement is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home of origin with prior placement.
The Internet is a mixture of components of mass communication and communication between people.
The different features that the Internet presents open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of users to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), it was also detected the "participation personal" and the "durable relationships" as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that, by reading its microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained the way in which those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of the speaker.
Even suggests that the skills to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between one and the next generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the resources of plants that it has available.
It is more, not doing it causes serious problems: slowing down of growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of food, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except when cooked.
On the other hand, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors had solved their "protein problems" in the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
The interruption of sleep consists in waking up intentionally during the normal sleep period and sleeping again after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved easily with a soft alarm clock that makes him return to a conscious state, although not completely awake.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm consist in drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige him to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is related to the amount of tension that is in their body and in their spirit.
The more the tension is reduced, the more positive is the force of life with which we count. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all attain enlightenment. The only thing that blocks the way is our tension and negativity.
Although the basis of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread through the path of love Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, laísmo is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the channels can be unblocked, the chakras can be activated and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up by distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies now were enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend over the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that for the 17th of September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize itself in the extension of the Romanian head of the bridge.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, bilateral and multilateral agreements, and other international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to guarantee that its country can transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The Atlantic campaign in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this circulation.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10 000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and skin, the ancient peoples and tribes started to keep them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills and other areas of pasture, with herdsmen who were often children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
In England, the railways had been installed in the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carriages were made of simple parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and to carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in their place was quite early. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
The practice of turning the wheels became a habit, although the iron caused a greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767, iron rails were used.
The first form of transport known was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
The Australopithecus ancestors did not have the habit of walking erect.
Although bipedal tracks have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, join environmentalist movements or, even, we can become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, the future suffering.
In many cases, like the asintomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is manifest that the world has suffered great changes, product of the technological and scientific advances of the human race, and the problems have intensified by the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of the people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, 1776, the draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, who lived a few blocks away.
The copies were made during the night, between 150 and 200, of which we know today as the "Dunlap copies".
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time and did so in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. They are birds.
Many people do not represent them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work in base to the manipulation of data coded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is finding an open bottle of medicine or cleaning chemicals.
Read the label to get information about specific first aid for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasite insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with the chinch, a very developed species to parasitize humans.
The bedbugs and the bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is estimated to be around 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among adults aged 20 to 50.
The central nervous system, union of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack of the multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women have twice the chances of men to suffer from EM.
A couple could conclude that raising a child would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific investigations.
It is not a test, however, but an experiment that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide the scientific investigation.
The focus of naturalists as well as philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those of science, were accepted.
As the domain of the Greek language was declining, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
In many cases, the rhythms present in physiological processes and in the behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free period of operation, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA consisted of a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using fagos, or viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fungus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected DNA fragment, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is a type of tourism that is based on the natural environment and attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and study of information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place from which they just came.
In this dynamic transfer vehicle, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists support that this massive economy of carbon has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
All are part of the society and use the transport systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is not common to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason for the complaints about the transportation systems that lead to such a large number of complaints and why do they occur daily? Are the engineers of the transportation systems simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial that is happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of the drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to be represented by a logical and approximate mathematical model.
In order to graphically represent the flow more clearly, three important relationships were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
The relationships between the devices facilitate the planning and design as well as the operations of the road devices.
The first species to fly were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This provides a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera are the only insects that are unable to fold their wings.
Aristarchus of Samos, a Greek astronomer, said that the Sun was the center of the Universe.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, <i>correct?</i>
Spanish: 
The Amazon River is the longest river in the world and the second longest in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water that flows into the oceans from the world's rivers, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian city of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
The Italian language is used in the Vatican City, both for drafting its official documents and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that most people working in the state speak is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The total number of citizens living in the Vatican City State are adherents of the Catholic Church.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
The guardar was greater similarity with the states of the matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only that, at the same time, had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things that we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be the elements like calcium and potassium. From now on, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metals.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of very small particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Therefore, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, due to the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need a pencil.
The only question is what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, that is, they tend to decompose with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km in the nearby side and of 100 km in the far side.
She is thinner under the moon and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more lakes in the side closer to the surface due to the thinner crust, which facilitated the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content are focused on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines assert that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes people to want certain things and what factors in their environment make them want or not want to do certain things.
Two very well known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
To the managers of this category it is difficult to take decisions that are not well received by employees, to impose disciplinary measures, to carry out performance evaluations, to assign responsibilities and to demand accountability from the staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it necessary to modify everything that has been done until now and do it in its own way.
In the end, the ultimate success or failure of the team is the leader's responsibility.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that guide the conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
Generally, they enjoy more autonomy than the members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet at different times, for example, which might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a "virtual invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of managing and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What motive could an organization have for submitting to the demand of the establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the available resources are used in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
The product of this, it is possible that the organization that works in team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process to attend the needs of the customers.
To make an organization innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They reduce the field of research and give it greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
It is known for a long time that several types of brain damage, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the apogeo of new technologies, we have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material for developing simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important field within computer science, which is responsible for the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligent machines.
Research in the field of AI implies the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and consultation requests from customers, as well as facial recognition, handwriting, and voice recognition.
These questions have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The system of Artificial Intelligence is used now often in the sectors of the economy, the medicine, the engineering and the military, in the same way as it was incorporated in various applications of software of videojuegos and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of the Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as a memory album.
Blogs can also contribute to improve the writing of students. Even though students usually start their blogging experience with a grammar and spelling that are not very careful, this usually changes in front of an audience.
Because students are the readers who usually criticize the most, the writer of blogs starts to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid the criticism.
In addition, blogging “demands that students be more understanding of the world around them.” The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics.
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting it of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
These aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas towards the north are little populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
For a comparison of population that causes great surprise to many: in the United States there are more African Americans than Canadians.
The location of the islands of East Africa is in the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wild life.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
The Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and it was imposed, in good measure, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial influence of Europe and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region limits with the Sahel to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon that they are followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Rotunda, reject the men and do not fear defending your position (there may be cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 they abandoned it after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco with the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who established their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist point of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left most of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the North Kivu province, where the clashes continue.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To transfer within Goma, one can opt for a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
Hello, and it is relatively inaccessible, has given "Tombuctú" an image of exotic and distant land.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was included in the World Heritage List, due to the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecozones, in each of which a different wild life develops.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognised as the icon of the SANParks.
As in all the natural reserves of South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island homonymous, which is the destination of most tourists consider the main attraction.
The comparison of the buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong with a luminous bar graph that is evident by the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and go to Kowloon, located in front.
The development of the northern coast of Hong Kong is concentrated in the reclaimed land.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see proof of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Notwithstanding this, the forests are not only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of the wild life and it is estimated that there are now 400 tigers in the area and 30 000 spotted deer.
The buses leave from the bus station to the other side of the river all day, but most, especially those going to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Because buses between districts are usually full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge of the river Oyapock is a cantilever bridge that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m of width.
Under the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that currently constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The region of the Guaraní people also hosted other aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native peoples.
The Spaniards gave the start to the stage of colonization, which extended for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established, in 1537, Paraguay has been able to conserve a good part of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
The most important polo tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also watch other tournaments and lower-level games in other parts of the year.
In the site of the Argentine Association of Polo you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the games.
The value of the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there. It is in front of the FIC West store, in Stanley.
They usually accept pounds sterling in any place within the islands. In Stanley, also you can pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There are chances that in the periphery islands they do not accept credit cards, but they might accept British or American money. Ask in advance to the owners to be able to define which is the accepted method of payment.
It is practically impossible to change money outside the Malvinas Islands, so it is advisable to do it before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere is winter and viceversa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
Winter is a deceptive season: though it is rare that temperatures are below the freezing point, the wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals of the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild life is not tame, so that it is not advisable to feed it or disturb it.
According to the authorities of the parks, it is recommended to maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals.
Even if they are not aggressive by nature, it is true that bison, uapatíes, elk, bears and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors suffer injuries every year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
In addition, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so it is best to avoid cooking foods that release a lot of aroma and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except for a British cruiser. They killed nearly two hundred Americans and Germans.
During the war for independence that the Mau movement faced, a peaceful meeting in the city had as a result the assassination of the state chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a lot of beaches, because Auckland has two ports. The most famous ones are in three areas.
In the district of North Harbour, in the Pacific Ocean, are the beaches of North Shore, which extend from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
The beaches are almost all of sand with safe places to swim and most of them have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
In the port of Waitemataas, the beaches of Tamaki Drive unfold, in the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the thing. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the local beer most popular and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
Although there is a great variety of French wines, the New Zealand and Australian ones could be considered better for transport.
The local water from the tap is completely safe for consumption, but, if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the notion of "black coffee" foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to the Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made during the year and, there, the wounds by any of these causes are rare.
In any case, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all the signals and pay special attention to the security alerts.
