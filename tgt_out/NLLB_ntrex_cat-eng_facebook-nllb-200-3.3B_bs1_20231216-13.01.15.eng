Members of the Welsh Assembly worried about being identified as Muppets
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposed change of their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen over the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all the different political parties have expressed their concern that this measure could become a laughingstock.
A Labour MP has claimed that his party was concerned that MWP  came with Twp or Pwp.
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means excrement.
A Plaid Cymru party assembly member has commented that his party as a whole "does not see it in a good light" and has proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group was "open" to the name change, but also commented that there was too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it should be noted that the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the English letter u from Yorkshire.
According to the assembly committee tasked with drafting the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualifications for naming the members of the assembly will of course fall to the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with widespread support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the assembly members, although the committee opted for Welsh Members of Parliament or WPM, the MWP option was the one that received the widest support in the public consultation.
However, the attempt to reach consensus may prove a disaster for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft of the changes in a matter of weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The assembly members will hold the final vote on its naming during the debate related to the legislation.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing their country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday whether or not they want to change the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed Athens' attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the name change plebiscite, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the difficulties of Harlem churches
"Historically, the older people I've spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams says.
Today, there is none left, of either.
According to Adams, the demise of bars can be understood.
"People have a different way of socializing today", he says.
"Bars are no longer the kind of neighborhood lounge where people used to go regularly".
As for the churches, he worries that the money they get from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders predict and sooner or later return to where they came from.
Churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who won't be any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be white", he says, "and so what they will do is accelerate the closing of all churches, since it is highly unlikely that most of the people who move into these condos end up being members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that originally existed in the area left in the 1930's.
A nearby black congregation purchased the property.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused severe damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly described the carillon as "the poor people's bells".
The expert who sounded the carillon in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been ringing in St. Martin's over the past few months, however, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the parish's governing body of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing concern that the diocese "was claiming to pass on costs" to the council, even though the latter was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while hunting for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy's cries for help, and then they rowed with a group to the boy's location to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was the joy of catching a lobster, but then he realized it was shouting 'They've bitten me!
He had his entire collarbone ripped off, Hammel observed when he reached the boy.
"To get everyone out of the water, I shouted, 'There's a shark in the water!'", adds Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It's not known what species of shark is responsible for the attack.
At a press conference, rescue worker Larry Giles commented that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso area.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas due to the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of shark in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed by specialist employees.
These large aisles are just one part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty market, a market that is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors lag behind, and will be trialled in 11 stores across the country to expand to more stores next year if the trial is successful.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their shelves that was previously destined for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will also receive more space with branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique makeup products so that most products are now vegan-friendly, an increasingly popular feature among younger consumers.
Retail chain The Fragrance Shop will additionally open concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities each day in small supermarkets has made it necessary for large supermarkets to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, the stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight off discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to jump-start grocery sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket chain's previous attempt to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's made a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended abruptly after disagreements over how to share the profits of the pharmacy chain within the supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-pharmacy business three years ago to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for £125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have a major role in the overall plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of skin products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our beauty aisles in order to improve the face environment for our customers.
We've invested in specially trained workers who will be a great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and that challenge the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby gets behind an 11 million GBP deal
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby backed out of an £11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the Truly home products and accessories joint venture.
The business of these two media personalities had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out at the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle brand joint venture to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring her big profits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the red-haired TV star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new deals, worth £1.5 million, meant she would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of home products and accessories Truly.
The business had come to be compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was meant to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to back down left all parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.
According to experts, the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman last March.
Both couples spend their vacations together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the next brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented last night that "We will not be commenting on his business dealings".
Tough accusations... and then we fell in love.
He joked about the possible criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider not typical of a president and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump resign so soon?
Trump said, mocking the tone of a news anchor:
I've given up nothing.
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to its first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the US continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's view, by contrast, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end of missile tests, help to free hostages and return home of the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded room, we'd have about 200", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A devastated island and hundreds of dead from a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs in other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international aid to be catalyzed.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not certain that foreigners will be allowed to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies would be allowed to contribute in offering aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country is unfortunately still unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a warning in place, is very likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Moving between Indonesia's vast number of islands is a challenge at best.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now heading to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces re-election next year with funding shortfalls.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's ongoing sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores the equaliser with a long shot against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by Chelsea with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 27 metres from Chelsea's goal as his team were losing 1-0.
He settled the ball to the left before releasing an incredible shot aimed at the second stump.
The shot crossed the entire area with great elevation as it propelled itself towards the right crossbar of the goal.
The ball finally started to descend over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
"I was just trying to get into that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanté coming, I made a play and didn't think much about it, I just threw.
Chelsea won 1-0 at half-time after scoring a goal in the 25th minute by their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue forward returned a pass to Mateo Kovacic from the heel before kicking from almost halfway down the field and sprinting into Liverpool's court.
Kovacic made a quick combo from the middle of the field.
He then made a magnificent deep pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overcame the defence to finish on the second post with a left-footed shot that Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, on the other hand, will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency data released Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings after Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake that sent waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was completely covered by the rubble of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was found stabbed
The murder investigation has been launched after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The woman, aged 44, was found at 7:55 with multiple stab wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street; subsequently, a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked residents of the area who have seen or heard anything in connection with the crime to report to the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan: "While the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to call on anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious, to please contact us.
I would like to make a call also to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the car's onboard camera, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
While the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are informing the victims' closest relatives of the events.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
When she learned what had happened, she was speechless.
Residents are being warned that it will be hours before they can re-enter.
He could hear a police officer explaining to a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
She keeps saying, "It's terrible!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordoned area with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained within the cordoned-off area controlling the apartment block.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and mention file 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the debate around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a sort of poetic justice for the Taliban's pure-play destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a bogus and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main targets.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor over the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many still believe to be worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than not now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a totally accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A murderous pig stabs a Chinese farmer to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local sources report.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a yard in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjoining pig pen.
According to him, in the courtyard there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg sledgehammer had fatally wounded the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs torn and bloodied", said the cousin, surnamed Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Footage recorded by the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 am on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig was kept locked and isolated to prevent it from attacking anyone else while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very rare, there have been previously reported cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had grabbed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't have the intention of doing harm.
Just give them the respect they deserve", he commented.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the entire southwestern United States.
Forecasters say Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, proper of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and was located 620 km (400 mi) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern U.S.
El Rosa will drop up to 250mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical moisture will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rainfall will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and the possibility of land clearing in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates near 50 to 75 mm per hour at several points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
50 to 100 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility of flooding, as the situation is deteriorating very rapidly due to the scattered nature of the tropical rains.
It is totally discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential rains could cause gorges to become uncontrolled rivers, and storms can bring wind gusts and dust clouds to specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains to certain points of the southern California coast.
Rainfall totals above 50 mm are possible, which could result in smaller waste streams and slippery paths.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated pools of tropical rain will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday.
Torrential rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October will see several major temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, though the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic temperature changes over short distances.
The central region of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the lingering summer heat will try to expand again.
October is expected to begin with warm weather across much of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures around 90 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) from the southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there is a strong possibility of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's speech on the subject of the death penalty.
More than 20 million viewers watched Thursday's heart-wrenching testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, alleged to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, which was broadcast on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting their usual Friday programming due to a last-minute turn of events: an agreement engineered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in exalted testimony, stated that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers watched this testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other networks that rebroadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has trouble calculating the number of people who watch from his office.
Put in perspective, this is a similar audience to that of a football playoff game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the highest-rated network, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's entire broadcast, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was able to get 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to data from Nielsen.
Interest remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as he was crushed by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator to go to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake remained blind for several minutes while being televised live on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
They said 'you have power, while so many women don't have it!
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, he commented that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Within hours, all the cable and broadcast networks were live streaming the moment the Judiciary Committee was to vote on whether or not to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee by next week, a condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After further discussion with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had influence, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticised her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and disregarding the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview in addition to the one with May on the front page of the newspaper, May's former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, where he claims that the proposal that the UK and the EU collect taxes from each other is totally absurd.
Wayde Sims shooting death: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of the LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and booked on a charge of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and claim to have found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to shooting Wayde to death, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that has culminated in this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to local law enforcement for their "diligence and for bringing justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He was a 6'6" (1.98 m) point guard and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "shattered" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
"Things like this are the ones that make you suffer all the time", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The national center for disaster prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was monitoring several tremors and tremors that had recently occurred.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined opposing demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independence-loving individuals held by riot police began throwing eggs and paint dust at them, which caused dark dust clouds to appear on the streets normally crowded by tourists.
Later that day, clashes occurred with police, who used batons to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We do not forget, we do not forgive" face to face with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not abated in this region of independence-mindedness a year after a referendum was held on October 1st, considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a large majority, although turnout was low, as those opposed to secession mostly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting by entering polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
The separatist groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the possibilities of Catalonia achieving independence.
Last year we had one of the best times.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck", she commented.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit close, victory in the autonomous elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, with many of their main leaders in self-imposed exile or detained awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the demonstration of support for the police with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is only increasing", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed ahead of trial since late last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the backsliding in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government", he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says there was damage to the doors and the building itself.
It's also possible that, at some point, someone fired a crossbow at the car.
A play by Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was the winning goal.
Livingston, who had been promoted this year, surprised Glasgow Rangers in what is Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach of the neighbouring club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's play made the difference, as, with this victory, Gary Holt's team climbed to the second position, which they share with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side, on the other hand, remain unbeaten away from home in the Premiership this season, and next Sunday they will face the leader, Hearts, with whom they are separated by a gap of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers host the Vienna Rapids in the Europa League this Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their unbeaten run to six games in the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston's not taking advantage of their chances against the visitors' direct play.
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scorer long before the goal, as his direct play caused all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way through the defence, but wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out stretching to try to finish the pass off Craig Halkett's head, which crossed the goal.
The locals were already fine with letting the Rangers get close to their area, as they knew they could get the visitors in trouble on isolated plays.
And that's how this breakthrough goal came about.
The referee whistled a foul against Rangers interests and Livingston made an opening into the side, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so Menga could touch it first and finish from the centre of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but were met with an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game,
The scene was repeated in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a merit stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's shot with his feet and Lithgow deflected another Livingston combination.
Rangers were engaged in hanging ups and downs in the Livingston area, only to be rebuffed.[citation needed] In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for an alleged Halkett inning to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for hands.[citation needed] Both were dismissed.[citation needed]
Livingston phenomenal: analysis of the work of the writer
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for the Livingston.
One man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His playing style and personnel have hardly changed since his return to the top flight, although much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be on Menga's heels throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, though.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as coach, they have definitely failed to keep up.
They failed to create chances (only once did they clearly overcome the home defence), and this should be taken as a warning by Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan warmly received in Cologne
It was all smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at repairing relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated because of issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
And it's the city that has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of supporters flocked to the surrounding area to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard as they condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Both demonstrations reflect the division of opinion surrounding the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled a dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies after being hit by a car
A cyclist has been found dead as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics attended the cyclist, he died on the spot.
The accident comes months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, a mile from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said that their officers are working to identify the man and report the facts to the next of kin.
The street has been cut and bypasses have been applied to bus routes, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers wounded in an altercation
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation at this high-security men's prison, according to the prison office.
The incident took place at Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, at around 09:30 on Sunday, local time, and is still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado agents were dispatched to the scene to put an end to the altercation, which involved eight inmates.
Officers had to be treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman: "We have deployed specially trained prison staff to look into an ongoing incident at Long Martin Prison.
Six employees have had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible for this altercation will be held accountable by the police and may have to spend even more time in jail.
The Long Lartin Correctional Center houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison had to be treated in a hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, riot police officers made an appearance at the prison to resolve a serious altercation in which staff at the center were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with significant flooding (drought-prone areas could benefit)
It's not unusual for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's precisely what's likely to happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the desert southwest, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued river flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly at Phoenix on Tuesday and make landfall on Monday night with showers.
The Phoenix National Weather Service commented in a bulletin that only nine tropical cyclones have maintained storm or tropical depression status within a 200-mile (322 km) radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles (64 km) of the Arizona border.
The most recent models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated spots where up to 150 mm would be recorded in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other desert areas in the southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could register 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated spots of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of the Rosa could be very good news, since the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although the floods are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could prove very beneficial, as the southwestern region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reports.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa continued to have hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (137 km/h), and is now located 400 miles (620 km) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 12 mph (20 km/h).
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific, which is causing it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm late on Monday afternoon or early Monday evening.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico could be heavy, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, 75 to 150 mm total rainfall is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm.
After that, Rosa will head northward crossing Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, eventually crossing Arizona and reaching southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from Rosa or what's left of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert of the southwestern U.S"., according to the National Hurricane Center.
The rains are expected to cause dangerous floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
The officers have issued a call for anyone who may have some sort of recording of the events with a cell phone to contact us.
Trump says Kavanaugh has "suffered the petty anger" of the Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump declared at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually abused her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in relation to his alleged.
The president said Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a jurist with an admirable record of service to the citizenry", he told the West Virginia crowd of supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of the Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don't run, but I actually do", she said.
That's why I go everywhere fighting for our great candidates.
Trump argued that Democrats are engaged in "resisting and obstructing".
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place as late as Friday, an aide to the Republican party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where casualty numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many more have been swept away by giant waves crashing onto beaches, as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast toward dusk, dragging many of the people to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away, which is why they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it swept away cars, logs, houses, destroyed everything on land, Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster mitigation agency show the number of shops and buildings destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's technology appraisal and enforcement agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical features of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
According to Nugroho, the deaths and damage could increase on the coast some 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications "were completely shut down and therefore no information" was coming from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse", he says.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a video shared on social media by a fan, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building giving desperate warnings to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water bursts into the seashore, washing away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused widespread power outages that have disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the military has begun sending humanitarian aid in cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami stands at over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to reach the city of Palu safely, where employees took shelter in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, they witnessed scenes of total destruction on the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the heartbreaking gesture of starting relief efforts, some people complained that aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, provisions and staffing from abroad can only start flowing if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says "well, it's a national disaster", we can start asking for international assistance, but that level hasn't been declared yet.
As the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that occurred on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing people kept hoping for a miracle and their loved ones to escape the grim story of the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued from a sinkhole.
On Sunday, rescue teams freed a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Besides Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden", he noted.
Mr. Gendon explained that in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse circulated among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, messages would appear with a grey check mark instead of a double blue check mark.
"I think that means the messages were not received", he added.
Thieves take $26,750 during a cash machine robbery in Newport on the Levee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Officer Dennis McCarthy indicated in the release that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man es ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "To be formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and used the alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the show's creator.
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good side, our bad side, our confused side, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
West is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former collaborator of West, has used his last name with or without hyphenation and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country marks the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in the Plaza de Tlatelolco that "military force will never be used again to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly student grants and opening more free public universities,
has stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI.
"As China becomes more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money it spends on AI research", says Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the US government have announced measures on AI, despite the country's general lack of a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the world's number one AI innovation country by 2030.
"Doubling the budget allocated to AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the world is lagging far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the field of AI", Lee pointed out.
"Doubling the funding could double the chances of the US achieving the next big breakthrough in AI", Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that outranked the top-ranked American player in Othello and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee positively assessed previous US Government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
"Often, American researchers have to work hard to get public grants", Lee said.
According to Lee, "It's not China that's taking away academic leaders; it's companies".
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired prominent academics to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the US' work in the field of AI could also be seen boosted by changes in immigration policy.
I believe that permanent residence cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in IA, he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its latest-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
China's National Natural Science Foundation grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other public bodies in the US give money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior in China, Lee pointed out.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of an Artificial Intelligence Select Committee.
Also, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently allocates over 100 million USD a year to AI research.
Meanwhile, for months, no measures have been applied in relation to the US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on changing the name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory and has barred it from NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slav majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is casting doubt on whether the minimum turnout of 50% is reached for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper is: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that were created in the wake of the breakup of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority in Parliament is required.
The State Election Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", declared 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for it to join the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join them head on, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that joining NATO will be accompanied by much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I think the vast majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said before depositing his ballot.
Zaev stated that a "yes" would mean "confirmation of our future".
In a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum participation required.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Manchester City's Sergio Agüero scores after bargaining away all of Brighton's defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were the undoing for Brighton in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a play that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He went through three Brighton defenses at full speed, smashing through the pitch with whatever came out of his foot.
Then Agüero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He bargained a defense before overcoming a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball on first down, inside the area, to Agüero, who with his right foot hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that slipped inside the net on the right side.
"Agüero has foot problems", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We decided that he would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the early lead in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
On that play, Aguero received the ball deep into Brighton's court and
He made a beautiful pass into space on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long stick.
The Sky Blues forward put the ball inside the net before heading out the backline.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League on Tuesday at 18:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, out of options, wants to eliminate the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to force another opening.
But Scherzer, highly competitive, hopes to get on the pitching mound next Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to make the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but they're still looking for their first division title.
Even if we don't play each other, at least we can go out there and pitch knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably be playing every point at the highest level, like no one has done this year.
Why would I want to miss this game?
The Nationals have yet to announce an opening pitcher for Sunday, but apparently they're determined to let Scherzer pitch if that situation arises.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, did a warm-up session on Thursday and would pitch Sunday, on his usual day off.
The Washington right-hander has an 18-7 record, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I don't introduce myself, but I actually do introduce myself, so I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates", she said.
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary, it shows their meanness, their bad intention.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control. But we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats' mission, he said, is to "resist and obstruct".
"And that can be seen in the last four days", he blurted out, and called the Democrats "dirty, mean, dirty and fake".
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which prompted a strong public outcry.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Whoa, whoa, what?
No, uh, no. Wait a minute -- that was a really bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
He's intolerant of those who speak their minds.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a long line of British MPs to be told that we are not welcome, all for the sake of speaking our minds.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she spoke out strongly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the no-confidence motion, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe -- ironically, these are similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday's meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party said that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings held on Friday nights have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of "more generous and kind" policies, if they ever existed, has long since been forgotten.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I once thought I shared a similar political vision expected me to make a U-turn and take positions I would never have taken, whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, social media is flooded with aggressive messages calling for my candidacy not to be renewed, denouncing centre-left policies and saying I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just happening to me.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who every day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they do not get mad.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of no confidence or every change in the selection rules, the party is getting smaller.
I've had a lot of advice over the last couple of years, and it's been, "Keep your head down, don't be so expressive, and everything will be fine".
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student, spurred on by the negligent Thatcher government, which literally left my entire class in the dust, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to convey is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of not renewing my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's unbeaten run to the top of the table
Two last-minute attempts distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved victory in this vibrant Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
Ayr, who are the only undefeated team in the ten, occupy the first position in the standings.
In the end, the home team won thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to take better advantage of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
"The matches we have played so far have tested us and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose opined: "Happy for the Ayres, they have seized the opportunities better than we have".
A try from Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland international Rory Hughes, conceded for the match by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty and, just at halftime, scored and converted a try to put the score 17-5 in Ayr's favour at the break.
But the Melrose started the second half well and the try of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
The match was then interrupted for a long time by the serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who retired in the bunker, and in the second half Ayr extended the distance again with a Stafford McDowall try converted by Climo.
Subsequently, alternate captain Blair Macpherson was cautioned with a yellow card and, again, the Melroses took advantage of one more man's superiority with an unconverted try from Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the home team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line-up, MacPherson scored a counter-attack behind the Ayr penetration spring.
Climo scored, as he had done again almost from the break, after Kyle Rowe collected a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to third-line winger Gregor Henry to score the home team's fifth try.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be ready to start a new career in the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he had been appointed a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his longtime comedy partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it appears that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan had intended to enter Glasgow's "thriving restaurant sector".
The sea is ours: Landlocked Bolivia hopes court reopens Pacific route
Sailors patrol their covered naval shipyard in La Paz.
Public buildings are flown with a navy blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are empowered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
To get it back is a duty.
Across Bolivia's landlocked territory, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains very vivid, as does the longing to sail across the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, it is waiting with a positive attitude for the result", pointed out Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the TIJ decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign outlet to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has high hopes for Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised last August.
However, some analysts think it is unlikely that the Court will rule in favor of Bolivia and that if it does, things will not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of the possible talks.
The TIJ's resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates that the case "was not complicated", Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, said.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea", Zárate noted.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk for a while, but it will be very difficult to have conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally rapid.
Next Monday Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho claims that his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a pipe dream to think that continued sanctions and the US's objection to a declaration ending the Korean War could bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first makes significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country considers the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of oversized hats, on their way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to protect yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of extravagant, disproportionately sized hats from their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has been overrun by impractical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the runway.
Valentino's signature piece was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were sickle-shaped earrings, a witch's hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of extra-folk masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, brightly colored, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete scuba diving suit, with tube and goggles, while another looked like a dark ice cone.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you're in luck.
Style watchers predict that huge hats could be implanted on the main streets near you.
The oversized hats step on the heels of "The Bomb", a two-foot-wide, straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski has worn.
The cult label behind the so impractical hat that spread through social media brought another great creation to the catwalk: a beach straw bag, almost as big as the swimsuit-clad model wearing it.
The dark orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia serrels and finished with a white leather nance, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career of their choice and for their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages remain a very popular and desired choice subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head".
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's examinations, we can see that languages lead the ranking tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the top grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students obtained an upper A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an elective subject, are held in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in curricula from independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission revealed that of the reasons employers gave for finding it difficult to fill vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more potential job opportunities require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language education is important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools in terms of the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, towards 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, he or she can always choose from a range of languages in independent schools, which have specialist teaching staff.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In today's global business environment, it is undeniable that languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, and this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It must be done well.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the minutes he'll play are still to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers reporter, tweeted that James will likely play a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to be ready", he blurted out.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off a wave of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies Trump is scheduled to hold next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump is aiming to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can it be viewed online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's West Virginia rally can be watched online at the link below, via YouTube live video stream.
Trump is likely to address the hearing this week with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been tense because of the sexual abuse allegations he faces, as the Senate's scheduled confirmation vote remains on hold until a week later and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main purpose of this wave of rallies is to help the Republicans who are running in the delicate November election gain momentum.
So President Trump's five campaign rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at boosting volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majorities, according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can as we head into a busy campaign season", said a Trump spokesman who declined to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is running unfavorably in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come in and give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows ambition to keep hopes alive ahead of Sunday's singles matches
After three uneven sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The dynamic tipping pendulum is a made-up sporting concept, one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
So which side is the positive dynamic on now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we're in a little bit of a positive streak", Jordan Spieth declared as he walked away at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind blowing a little in their favor and have many reasons to be excited, largely because of the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and he's setting an example.
The guttural shouts of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his turn and he putted a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that won the match on the 15th hole with a similar shout, of the kind that indicates that he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
"You have to try your best and worry about your own party", Spieth pointed out.
It's all these players have left now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players to have more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup sensation.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four of fours and make no mistakes.
Moliwood were the only pair that did not make a Saturday afternoon bogey, and also avoided the Saturday morning and Friday afternoon bogey, and the final nine holes Friday morning.
By this result and the way their energy seems to flow in and out of the bustling crowd, it is reaffirmed that it is the players who beat Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to lock in a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, to speak of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly finished with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, who paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and Swede into a hole from which they never had a chance to get out.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to watch because of the interactions between the equipment, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change all of a sudden.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the final day with a significant advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the US, had questioned.
Europe reaches Ryder Cup final with favourable score of 10-6
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after ending Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went to great lengths to score two victories against a struggling Tiger Woods and to break their record, to date, by four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who was aiming to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an unsuccessful American team at the morning fourballs and put the series at 3-1.
The U.S. put up more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not narrow the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to score four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed on fourballs, they put on a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two games on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourballs, paired up with Henrik Stenson again in the foursomes and fell 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have it all on a nice, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new record for the Americans on Saturday by scoring two points.
They won a determined 2-1 victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter at fourballs and later won back Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 at foursomes, after having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team overcome a four-point margin in singles matches, although Furyk's defending champion team only needs a draw to retain the title.
However, after being second best for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is out of his reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm any way if signs of trust are not appreciated
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying his mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any response in line with the US", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way.
While Ri took up North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization approach whereby North Korea would be rewarded as it took steps step by step, his statements seemed significant in that he did not reject full unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump made at the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The US insists that denuclearization must occur first and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the declaration of end of the war, Ri noted.
The perception that sanctions will bring us to our knees is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuous sanctions are intensifying our mistrust.
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader outlined at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stalemate".
However, Ri's tone was very different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President Trump dubbed Kim "Rocket Man" in a suicide mission.
At the United Nations last year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament steps, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearises.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared to the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm complete and final denuclearization".
The Security Council has pushed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later communicated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took "consonant action".
He said Kim had communicated to him that the "consistent measures" he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, in addition to actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a class on resting habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep longer in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of all-night study stimulated by caffeine.
One academic noted that students at the world's top universities are often misled about the basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
And at the end of the talk, this girl came up to me and said, "Why are they telling me this now, my senior year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first implemented this year, teaches students the basics of how good sleep habits improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, stated that the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive assignments.
In one section is a picture of a dorm room, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, banners and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance affects sleep deprivation, and the importance of maintaining a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
We know that student behavior won't change overnight.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes", Professor Czeisler noted.
The culture of pride in staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students make sleep deprivation an increasing problem.
Ensuring that they get enough quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode and makes students hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes in his last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask graduate students to undertake a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal finishes the Gerrard's men with a goal
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at home to Livingston which is another stumble away.
The Ibrox side were looking to pick up their first home win since last February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as manager to leave their side adrift, 8 points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership's unstoppable leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half, and it never seemed that Rangers, lacking inspiration, were on the verge of equalising the score.
While Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston move up to third position, behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties afterwards, as linebacker Calum Spence required medical attention for a head injury caused by an object apparently being thrown from the stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up that swept Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same starting eleven that kicked a point against Hearts last week, surely feeling satisfied by the way his well-organised side smothered their rivals at every turn.
While the Rangers dominated possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the second minute of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder shot off and squandered the great opportunity.
A blunt foul by Keaghan Jacobs hit captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot to the back post.
The Rangers were in control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty at the fifteen-minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only managed two shots on goal in the first half, but Ibrox first-team goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problem with the header from Lassana Coulibaly and docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi's first act in the 34th minute might have been against the run, no one can deny that they deserved it for their effort alone.
Again, the Rangers couldn't match Jacobs' well-crafted play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted at the break by trading Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The trade had a virtually immediate impact, as the end made a pass to Morelos, though the imposing Kelly ran to the block.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the attention of visitors by playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's side could have given up the lead in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow made a deflected shot from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still called a last-minute penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson rolled his eyes.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as the "Geiger computer".
The Geiger counter, which has been a mainstay of science ever since, also became a mainstay of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms emanating from the radioactivity in minerals".
Evans: "It's sure going to blow up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
You can look at a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject it
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2), and then injecting them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., "the results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine".
The HER2 protein "promotes the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West went on a pro-Trump rant wearing a MAGA hat after his performance on SNL.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was written out of the show during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After her third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Again cap, she began criticizing Democrats and reiterating her support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say, 'How can you like Trump if he's racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago", he said.
SNL began with a Matt Damon spoof, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over the sexual assault allegations brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the post.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not treated well backstage because of the hat he wore.
"I was threatened backstage.
I was told not to go out with that hat on.
I was besieged.
And then they say I'm in an inferior position", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" while saying he would put on the Superman cape so that he could not be told what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love".
His comments drew public scrutiny at least twice and the show's crew members seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter tell the publication, "The whole study went completely silent".
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-husband, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West baffled much of the audience with his performance of the song I Love it, disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR STANDING OUT OF THE MULTITUDE".
But the talk show host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and who is absolutely wonderful".
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free to go.
And so are we", he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly called Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince was renamed by a symbol and later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday in west Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has come out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for portraying the role of the swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of the virile hero, stating that these roles imply that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with Culture magazine from The Sunday Times, Kit said that he believed "something had gone wrong" and that he was wondering how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that he is determined to tackle the issue.
"Personally, I now wonder where we went wrong with masculinity", he says.
What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we experience now?
According to Kit, television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity thanks to its virile characters.
He added: "What is innate and what is acquired?
What is it that is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel they must have this facet of manhood?
I think it's one of the great questions of our time: How do we change it?
Because something has definitely gone wrong with the young boys.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series finale is scheduled for next summer, all while saying that he is fed up with battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best thing Game of Thrones has ever given him.
"I met my wife on the show, so it gave me my future family and my life going forward", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV from this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is common.
Given the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90 percent of men who engage in homosexual relationships will eventually marry a woman.
Many sexually transmitted diseases are caused by a lack of proper sexual precautions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican senators and debunks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the demands were driven by critics and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a session of the Senate committee on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was related to Waters' office and that it revealed information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and a pure lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent reports, was not responsible in any way for this information leak.
This baseless allegation is completely false and a pure invention".
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is full of indignation", Fleischer wrote.
"That makes you think you don't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not become angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and composed".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Important if it is true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted the relevant authorities and law enforcement of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed", he continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for all actions they have taken that have harmed each and every one of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again: a parody of the limited spy by Rowan Atkinson
It's a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this reboot of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Will this humorous self-satire about how despicable we are be another opportunity for the country's export?
In any case, the rubber-faced, gouged-out-eyed incompetent Johnny English has been able to renew his license to twist it all for a second time.
Evidently, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare pretensions to liquid glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveller Atkinson who represented the now-forgotten Barclaycard television advertisements, where he was wreaking havoc everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this last journey of JE.
He loved Johnny English, who approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and had the leaves of the helix clicking on his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's gift for physical comedy, but the humor seems rather flowing and strangely superfluous, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems intended for children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as witty or focused as the silent gags of Atkinson's Mr. Bean character.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the network of Britain's top-secret web spies and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the dismay of the duty officer, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and beleaguered figure, who is already suffering a total collapse from lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Teresa-May-esque character, but the script doesn't go much further.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And that includes the clumsy Johnny English, now employed as a professor at some fancy institution, but teaching off-the-record classes on how to be an undercover agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his dry-cleaning suitor Bough, a role that Ben Miller reprises.
Now Bough is a married man, attached to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of when things get very ugly in Her Majesty's secret service come into action once again and find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous follies: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French fast food restaurant, wreak havoc by smuggling contraband aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes a major stir by attempting to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are certainly taken from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, it all looks like a children's program.
It's pretty common.
As with other Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to wonder if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to her talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is devising a plan to get the British to have a four-day work week and cover five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week and get paid for five.
Supposedly, the party wants company bosses to pass on the savings gained from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them one more day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the economic agenda of the parties and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The change to a four-day work week is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to take advantage of the economic change.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits into the party's perspective of "balancing the economy in favour of the worker" and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration in a joint manner at present.
According to a Labour spokesman: "A four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it".
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also imply that shareholders of the water companies might not recoup the entire investment, as the Labour government could apply "deductions" for perceived wrongdoing.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to hand over 10% of private sector firms' shares to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends worth up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be published Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than her South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean it", said Kennedy.
"At the hearing I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened and the allegations became public, and I asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined, and confident".
But Graham's vote seems to be burned.
"I have my own opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I would make an explosive accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people you nominate can verify that.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing".
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it done anything to reduce poverty?
New York City will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, featuring an absolutely stunning lineup of stars, who are on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
In its seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather on the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's global goal of ending extreme poverty in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively help fight it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (as long as someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
What has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years left to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just another case of what we call "clictivism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, which have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over USD 37 trillion, which will have influenced the lives of over 2,250 million people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that to date protected funds have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based investor and developer association, which pledges to "help children grow as much as possible" and pledges to send $35 million to Rwanda to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens members like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on their website that asked "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It's going to be a long, hard road. Sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before it, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy as 'blockade' to hamper Russian energy exports (Home Secretary)
Washington can, "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to trade energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe", he allegedly said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockade, to prevent its energy from entering the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are effectively equal.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels", he said, while indicating that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the "inadequate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is due simply to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Department Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to back off from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", declared Dieter Kempf, director of the BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will "think carefully" about her candidacy for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "think carefully" about running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider her candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the fracture of government, for women to hold high office", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town meeting and claimed that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, "it's clear we need an FBI investigation before the election".
However, a poll released Thursday showed a majority of Warren's own voters believed he should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the nomination.
The poll revealed broader support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who were considered in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD-affected Track Palin at the rally of Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"With what my own son is going through since he came back, I can understand other families who are suffering from the ramifications of PTSD and some of the emotional wounds that our soldiers come back with", he explained to the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans, "they become a little different, they become hardened, they become wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the military, have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and is charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a plea of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge to a new asylum policy
Twelve states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus curiae brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who was challenging the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the lawsuit in the Grace vs. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the US, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine stated Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal law requires that asylum claims be adjudicated according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates that principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide needed jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those persons who leave their country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, even the most serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming increasingly desperate.
"The atmosphere is very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calmed her feverish son at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance is bringing bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water".
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to grab flooded belongings and try to salvage what they can.
There are hundreds of injured, and hospitals, battered by the 7.5 magnitude quake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured her shoulder, are outside the Palu military hospital as patients are being treated outside due to the repeated heavy shaking.
Tears welled up in his eyes as he described how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
I heard my wife crying for help and then I didn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're all right".
The US ambassador accuses China of harassing him with "propaganda ads".
A week after an official Chinese publication ran a four-page ad in a US newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump last Wednesday addressed the China Daily paid supplement to The Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the US election marked what US officials have told Reuters is a new phase in Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an intensifying trade war that has seen tariffs on each other's imports soar.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claimed that Beijing had harmed US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "is redoubling the harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press".
"In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press by inserting a paid advertisement in The Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and see no real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens may have about China's worrisome economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was evading the offer to publish" his article, but did not name the publication.
Republicans are taking away women's votes ahead of the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, analysts warn.
With many leading Republicans supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to have an FBI investigation conducted will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched in the Senate lobby as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be off the chart", explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've been tall; it's true.
But it could have been more, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, 18 to 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony, detailing his sexual assault claims against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative response could be produced if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this issue and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford star and those who witness Kavanaugh, with the balance tipping slightly toward the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents undoubtedly or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to undoubtedly or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or undoubtedly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same of Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating claims made by Ford and at least one other whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted him while under the influence of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party while attending Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and who can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of which are available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data warehousing is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some on-staff developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one on his team is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether we need to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely emptied overnight.
"We're not asking for your permission".
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Victoria Cross of the I GM
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque at a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under intense gun and machine gun fire".
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with "utmost courage" advanced the line before throwing himself over a cannon with one hand and stunning three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel was shot down by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat that he could never match, which produces a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a true hero is shown by the support he will receive from many people.
The MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 and being denied the biggest event of the year.
The San Jose card contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and were to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00pm, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the showdown, UK viewers were stunned when the programme was switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset because they had stayed up all night to watch the fight.
One Twitter follower described the move to cartoons as "kind of a vomit shock".
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they switched to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the rebroadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yeah".
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would work on the programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work", said Coker.
"But there it is six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we cannot solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not all of them were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We're gonna leave it at five fights instead of the usual six, and we tried to show it to the fans again, but it ended.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to other people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old athlete has stated that he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a father had made it less important to him to win the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off for illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" others because he was "not socially acceptable as boys and girls".
She said the following: "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph".
She wanted to prove that she was "something", she said, so as not to disappoint anyone when she eventually discovered her sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been an issue.
According to him, when you go through so much when you're young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June of a son whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "his whole perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold", he said.
"There are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'Dad, you're not going to be there to occupy the front row,'" she said.
"As I held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that he was dead, that I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games. There was no better feeling", she declared.
It also inspired the choice of her first song (Proud by Heather Small), which she had heard during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which still gave her goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
A worsening Mickelson showed up for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday as he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his physical condition if he does not want to become an unhappy target.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was introduced by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as has been customary for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments splits his time between cheerleading and working on his game on the field, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the peak of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough usually punishes the deviated shots.
And if his own track record isn't daunting enough, Mickelson, in game nine on Sunday, will face the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down in starting all 12 singles matches, start strong, Mickelson's match could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He understood his role for the day perfectly, slapped me on the back and put his arm around me while telling me he would be ready the next day", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's a hall of famer and he's done a lot for these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how he trained and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like everybody else".
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It may mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that has not matched his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, jokes, likes to make fun of people and is a great teammate", she explained.
I think the younger players also had fun getting laid with him this week, which was fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the game than that.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the lead can be erased soon
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage in the singles matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, when the Seve Ballesteros-led team had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they won by the narrowest of margins, 14.5-13.5.
"You keep remembering that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by a little bit", Bjorn said, in the image, after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History has taught me and all the members of the team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go all the way.
You have to go out there and do it right.
This isn't over until the points are on the board.
We have one goal, to try to win the trophy, and we have to stay focused to do that.
I've said it before, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have in mind who our rivals are: the best players in the world.
Delighted with his players' performance on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I'll never rush into this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performance will make the difference and change everything.
It's great to be with a partner when everything is going well, but individual duels really test your golf ability.
That's the message you're gonna give the players, bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
At that point, you let your partner go and he has to go out and get the best of himself too.
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the last day's back-to-back wins, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to start on a good foot, like we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When you have a team that's inspired, it creates a lot of pressure in these central duels.
We've prepared the lineup based on the circumstances and the best way to try and do magic tomorrow.
Thomas is challenged to try to start the comeback against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I chose this order because I think it covers all possibilities", Bjorn says of his selection for the individual matches.
Germany's new battleship, postponed again
The German Navy's new frigate was supposed to have been completed in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, but will not be completed until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have set the deadline for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy commissioned in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other notable features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use new frigates for up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continuing delays imply that the forward-deployed ships, which were expected to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the dreadnought Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once it had been delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons for her return, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that rendered her unusable if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are significant, as approximately 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the older Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-Württemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been noted that the ship's weight is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" will weigh twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Aside from the faulty materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also starting to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from an initial budget of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, if recent warnings are taken into account that indicate that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, has acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships that can be used.
The official has claimed that the situation has worsened over time as the old ships were taken out of service, but no new ones were provided as replacements.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
New research on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape to feed.
It is hoped that the discoveries may provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow soprano and common bats, as well as northern eared and water bats at Inverewe Botanic Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
Volunteers and staff from the UK National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Experts' analysis of the sound recordings will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and habitat map will be created to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser at the National Trust for Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do paper mosquitoes and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to locate insects and obstacles that get in the way of their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts with the proper training, who conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues on a regular basis.
In fact, the organisation has created Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate's administrator, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
"Here in Threave, we have a large area for bats", he says.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.
He notes the importance of checking for bats before doing maintenance work on properties, as the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest could kill more than 400 females and young, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, harass them, and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer with the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to step forward to help.
He stated the following: "We still have a lot to learn from bats and, in the case of some of our own species, we do not have enough data on their population".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the rape allegations against him are "fake news" and has claimed that people "want to become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers are suing the German weekly Der Spiegel, which is responsible for publishing the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid $375,000 at the time to keep the incident from becoming public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed it was "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just trying to be nice.
What they said today, fake news, says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They want to be famous because of my name.
It's only natural.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is in order", added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have described as "unacceptable information of suspicion about privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to reports filed in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him he was a 99% good guy, except for a 1%.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to cancel the agreement, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of signing for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he signed for Juve, the Italian giants, in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading manufacturer after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
'My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,' said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU with no agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU will work has raised fears among other UK carmakers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims that it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a 'just-in-time' basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for automotive manufacturing.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on 29 March, there could be riots at the border, which the industry believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to be halted as a result.
Clark claims that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls".
"We have to get a deal, we want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not just to enjoy the success we have now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains".
Toyota has not been able to confirm for how long production would be halted, but, in the long term, has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, said members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: "From experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back".
A government spokesman said: 'We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU'.
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's highly anticipated meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed by a week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Russia and Trump aid, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general and jeopardizes Mueller's independence has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has stated that he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but postponed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied as follows: "No date has been set yet, it could be this week, although it may be that it will be delayed another week for all the issues with the supreme court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists might dispute this claim: Sanders has not made a single White House briefing since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of briefings was not because he disliked the bragging of television journalists, though he said: "I won't deny that they're braggards".
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any previous president", he said, before adding the following without citing any source: "We have consulted these data".
Sanders has stated that briefings will continue to take place, but if the press has the ability to ask the president of the United States directly, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often, you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and it will replace the briefings when you get to talk to the president of the United States.
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are infrequent.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal and, at times, bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in Scottish National Health Service over Brexit fears
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the United Kingdom's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of residence status applications for EU citizens working in devolved public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote the following: During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and everything seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also started preparations in case of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a turbulent time for all of you.
So I just wanted to reiterate that I really appreciate the contribution of all the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting patients and the communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers running back Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told the press that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"It came to the sideline and plummeted there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him in a litter and taking him away for further testing.
An official from Tennessee State reported to Chris Harris, of WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is Abercrombie's first season as a sophomore with Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making it a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty on buying property in the UK with the extra money used to help the homeless under the Conservative Party's new plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those people who do not pay UK tax.
Hisenda hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to be charged a higher stamp duty on purchases of UK property and the money will be used to help the homeless, a measure Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those individuals and businesses who do not pay UK tax; this money will go towards the government's action to combat the homeless figures.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and real estate speculation, could be as high as 3%.
The estate expects to get up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are owned by non-British residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to break through to the property ladder.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people get their first homes.
He accused the large developers of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable housing to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a number of attractive proposed housing reforms, such as rent controls and the end of "no-fault" evictions.
It also wants to give more power to the town councils to build new homes.
May said the following: "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must be better for each new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and make a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is equally easy for people outside the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the indignity of homelessness makes it all the more real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to coach Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his "greatest ambition" is to be Scotland manager at some point.
The Scot, 42, has accepted the challenge of reviving the north-east club, who currently sit in third position in League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called up once as a back-up and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it's always something that takes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I am successful coaching clubs, but .
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio, who were all appointed by the club in the summer of 2009.
The former Alloa Athletic manager claims he does not feel the pressure of being next on a list of established names at such a big team, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be whether I can get this team back into the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is obvious that its place is the Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would only consider myself successful here if I can bring the club back".
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a spell as second-in-command at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaching staff.
He helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to Championship champions the following season.
Ross claims he feels more comfortable now than he did during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a turning point", she recalled about accepting the role at Allowa.
I always thought that coaching was my best skill, rather than playing.
It's weird because I did it right, I got by reasonably well and I had a pretty good time.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot you have to get through every week.
I still struggle with aspects like stress and pressure from work, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable time I've felt since I've been an adult.

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has boosted consumption in Britain's struggling bars, but has added more pressure on restaurant chains.
Bars and chain bars have seen a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has fallen by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, from the financial advisory firm CGA, which collected the data, states the following: "The continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has been extended more than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with the increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by drink consumption, have had the best results, while consumption in restaurants has been declining.
Bars serving food have also been hit by the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurants.
It seems like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we consulted, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sales of food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, from leisure and hospitality analysts RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of large social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to sales in the foreign leisure market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, but a 4.8% year-over-year decline in sales would be especially damaging, more so than continued cost pressures.
This long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-serving businesses and time will tell if the milder temperatures we've had in August will provide that much-needed breathing space.
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including recently opened ones, was 2.7% in July, indicating a slowdown in brand presentation.
The sector sales indicator The Coffer Peach Tracker for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of over £9 million and is the established benchmark for the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to survey data
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in fake Instagram pages.
News has raised fears about the posting of sexual content
20% of students claim to have a "main" account that they show to their parents
One in five kids, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
The news has raised fears about the posting of sexual content.
About 20% of students say they have a net "principal" account that they show to their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to "rape me".
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Private School Headmasters' Committee (HMC), has revealed that 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, half of whom have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the 'voice of athletes' at the Scottish Athletics Association board
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed as a non-executive director on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit from its inclusion in the directive", Beattie said.
Doyle has stated the following: "I am very keen to act as the voice of athletes and hope to grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland".
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic medals and is currently a regular commentator for the BBC, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted the following: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if I could recover or to what extent.
It's been exhausting, but I've made a full recovery, I've learned to walk again and today is agility practice!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
A leaflet comparing mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
One flip-flop company has divided opinion online with an ad that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "world's first silent, wearable t-shirt", consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a music video joke to showcase the freedom the new t-shirt gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of farrages and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I'll move myself, but you won't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not braggers, they're my breasts".
The round continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, feed the girls".
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reaction from those who have seen it, many of whom claim it shows the horrors of the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth", one person wrote.
The Elvie wrap is discreetly concealed in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented as follows: "Understandably traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a flyer for mothers who will keep their babies?
Another user added: "It's an inappropriate ad".
Others defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song "funny".
I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping for the toilet made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little crazy, but you have to take it for what it is.
It's a great product", wrote one user.
Another person commented as follows: "It's a funny ad targeted at mothers who pump with tissues (usually at their workplace or in the bathroom and feel like cows.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the bandana discreetly tucked into the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use the band-aid.
However, the Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra, giving women more freedom to move, restrain babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood developer of Mother, has stated the following: The Elvie t-shirt is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
By drawing the parallel between women and cows, we wanted to show the audience how to use a bandana and the challenges involved in doing so, while demonstrating, in a fun and educational way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new bandana offers.
This isn't the first time that Elvie the stripper has been in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children, quietly moved to a tented camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children being held has increased even as monthly inflows across the border have virtually held steady, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid of risking their chance of staying in the country if they decided to adopt a child.
The risk has increased since June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults living in their homes will have to submit fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to take in unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
About 80% of people who have hosted or are living in the home of a host are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people", Albence declared.
To process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of the previous standard of 60 days, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear via videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for aid will be deported immediately.
The longer children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to workers and reports the system has released in recent months.
Lawyers say that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eight-year-old war.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, has claimed that foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the "war on terror is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions to be displaced.
He has stated that Damascus will continue "fighting this holy battle until we have purged all Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that conditions were good for their return and has blamed some Western countries for spreading irrational reasons that make refugees want to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
"They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats have claimed that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has fostered the opportunity to continue political meetings.
The Russia-Turkey deal has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed hope that military action will deal with the jihadists, which include fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, UN envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to begin outlining a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, scandals and impeachment proceedings prematurely end his presidency.
Which would, without a doubt, be "the end of one of the most dramatic presidencies in history".
At this time, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led cable television viewership with up to 3.5 million viewers on prime news nights.
"People have been thrown into it because they don't understand it", says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
He said it was because it made him laugh. He called me Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike the TV shows, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be reunited and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen goes further when you're within six hours of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "private" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket, and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' gruesome descriptions of, say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I'll never look at Super Mario the same again.
"Part of what makes it feel like it's part of a reality show is that every night gives you something new", says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the character changes and script twists on Trump's show (fucking the NFL, praising Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're staying behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, it was about 75 degrees and sunny outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was locked in watching MSNBC while CNN was taping.
He couldn't let go, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing those crazy shows back then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Foreign money floods the races of the tightest midterm elections in the House of Representatives
It's no surprise that there's a flood of cash in Pennsylvania's 17th district, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has two incumbent members competing for the same seat.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburgh involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the parties' main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a closely watched special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held the office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political pundits give the Democrats a slight edge.
US imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but withdraws them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador was contemplated, which received in 2017 an aid from the United States of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be damaging to the Central American country and the high murder and unemployment death tolls.
With the internal meetings over, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any chance of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on it, according to diplomats.
The three American envoys discreetly returned to their posts in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, who include two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations from anonymity.
An outside analyst, close to the administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
He studied history
The next event to occur could be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is ample evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself holding the body accountable, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler, but only if the Western bloc resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates at turning points like this and speeds up or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing several turning points right now.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the news since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unfit for the job.
Rosenstein claims that the Times' information is inaccurate.
How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is upheld for the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and perjury?
And, especially, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will start to be in danger.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because I learned my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers, optimistic ahead of the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, aware that a win against the Austrians, after an impressive draw at the Villa-real ground this month, would leave them in a good position to qualify for group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first few minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Real, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team", said the player, 31 years old.
We played the game thinking we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten something more out of it in the end, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second half.
On Thursday, it is another big European night.
We hope to keep the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they got a good result in the last match, but I'm sure we will give everything and get a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I sustained and the changes at the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys are enjoying themselves, the training is good.
I hope we can give it our all, put last season behind us and succeed.
Women lose sleep over the fear of saving for retirement
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people discussed this with their families.
Approximately half of the nationally surveyed said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent of those surveyed said they had spoken to their children about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they don't dare ask", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
We have to start here.
Talk to your spouse and children. You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to decide where and how to get care, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation - they can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover the costs, or self-insurance with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepare your legal papers: cut the legal battles.
Find a representative so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that professionals honor your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider also obtaining a notarial power of attorney for your finances.
It is a good idea to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in the event of your incapacity.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly relative has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finances are not the only factor that has to be determined, but also which doctors you want to treat", said Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready".
Man shot multiple times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with a shotgun while returning home after a night out.
The victim, aged in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
'Officers have described the shooting, which occurred at around 2.30am (UK time), as a 'random act'.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His life is not in danger from the injuries and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities.
As communications are cut off, relief units have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on Celebes Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Cèlebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Cèlebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of Celebes Island.
The regency, an administrative region less than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the coast at the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 a tsunami also occurred west of Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes occur frequently.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake shook a populated area of Padang City, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake rocked one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 metres (33 ft) deep that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but over 100 people died because of buildings that collapsed.
2018: A series of large earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she pulled out her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Provisional Detention Center, where he is being held on a 500 USD bail bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he pleaded "not guilty, with certainty" when asked how he pleaded, according to this network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could go to prison for up to a year and pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to notify them of the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His partner testified that he punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake rocked the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The quake struck just off the coast of Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the impact are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking an exceptional death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - an extraordinary sentence that hasn't been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists during his ride in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes could carry the death penalty, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury struck Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors typically use in Mafia cases, in addition to one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors claimed the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's manner of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the notice of intent, which was filed by the police.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police explained that he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
According to police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be unfurled in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of misdemeanor theft.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accept a plea of guilty and a life sentence without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative party conference.
The former UKIP leader has claimed that politicians should "feel the pressure from Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Outgoing Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted as pro-union Conservatives have turned out at another anti-Brexit protest in The City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan in place amid attacks from Brexit supporters, unionists and the EU.
Allies insist he will manage to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the Conservative party to choose between his package and chaos.
Mr Bone told the Solihull Leave Means Leave meeting that he wanted to undo Chequers's pledge.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd already be out,' he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to undo Chequers' commitment".
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be serfs.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed their mind and want to stay is totally false".
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: "I just tell you, Prime Minister, listen to the people".
"Chequers' commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out into the streets and get us to win an election.
Drop the Chequers commitment and start listening".
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said politicians at the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class", he said.
"They are trying to cheat Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not allow them to do that".
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, she added: "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure".
"We are mobilising the popular troops of this country who gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, union supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners about the anti-Brexit Conservatives after the group's launch this weekend.
Conservative Member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with a party app at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for the frictionless border, for the borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
"It is a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open house in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Representative Geoff Diehl, who served as deputy chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He has been the center of speculation about the possibility of relieving Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open meeting format since Trump took office.
An aide asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top".
One person arrested in the shooting death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge, La., police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims received a shot to the head that ultimately killed him", police officer Murphy J. Paul told media outlets Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton District Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas stood ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes team orders would play a big role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas got off to a good start and nearly exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits early and let Hamilton run with the traffic at the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to pit stop and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to abandon the free inside with the risk of being out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and by the end of the first lap was in seventh position on his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position for much of the race, as he conserved his wheels to save time, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and moving into fourth position.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the next eight laps and Raikkonen was in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me pass.
The team did a fantastic job to get a one-two", Hamilton said.
Her body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "evil, cruel and liars".
"Something that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see angry, evil, cruel and lying people", he said.
"When you look at the communiqués and the leaks and they say, 'No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember his response -- did you leak the document?
No, no, no. I was just...
I didn't leak it".
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered -- No, we didn't filter it", she added as she imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's anti-Kavanaugh statements in July and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, just like he asked me to".
But his denial did not please the president, who commented at the Saturday night rally, "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the statements to their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to have power and control", the President said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants and the team with the best record in the league
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite defeat against Belfast Giants as they won the return match 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately took a two-goal lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the bar for their team, but Dwyer later restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee, then two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer in the fourth minute, at 3:35, from an assist by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with an assist from David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this hectic early period, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt equalized at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first period when he scored the second goal of the night late in the first period.
The home team regrouped and once again Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the match at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies trying to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake-stricken plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after dying to ensure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a massive earthquake rocked the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many aftershocks occurring in the area and there are many people trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his fellow passengers escaping for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his seat in the shaky control tower of Palu Mutiara Six Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that Batik Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he came out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This has broken our hearts", she added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the rubble and there are still many that have not been accessed", said agency representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial planes are bringing in aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance is bringing in dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been looted".
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working around the clock to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is a tragedy, but it could get worse".
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after the crash in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that was to crash into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, though it previously said all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, as of Saturday afternoon, they were unable to find a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities reported Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed the plane grounded in the lagoon because the runway was too short.
Some witnesses believe the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was flying very low.
"That was extremely positive", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to walk with water up to their waists to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve a dock also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the affected people ashore before the plane sank some 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors wrapped up the case Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to construct the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicted her previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he claimed to be in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he had lied, as his van was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Phone records indicate that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin their final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of gender.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and bring conscious hip-hop back into fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK from the hand of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY nanny sues couple for firing after "racist" post
A New York City nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother protesting that she was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and liken the lawsuit to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at seeing the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, as black when she arrived at work on her first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOO Another Black Person", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Madame Maurice, twice.
After realizing her pity, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Maurice, all claiming that the nanny she had dismissed, who was African American, had done her job poorly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received her day's pay and was then sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is claiming compensation from the couple for the dismissal and is asking for compensation of approximately 350 USD per day for the six-month residency job for which they had hired her, even though there was no contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do things like that", he told the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have responded to the claims that they are racist by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid of not being able to trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent you something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people", the husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you had a grudge, even if it was by mistake?
A baby? What is it?
Come with me".
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to "extortion", claimed that his wife was two months away from having a baby and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going to pursue something like that?
It's not a very nice attitude", the investment banker added.
The legal case is still unresolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers might not identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It's very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success".
She explained that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book about a little stuffed bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection. She also said that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was "bittersweet", following his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and adds that his father was very proud of him, of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous one", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was practically like when your child achieves something: you're proud, even if it's not your own.
I think he saw Paddington's success as that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, I always used to acknowledge Paddington's own merit".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad would call frequently to say that it was very bad and that they did not expect him to get over it", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he told me that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medication they had given him to keep his body beating was being used up and being released from his system.
He had died earlier than expected, and so everything was shut down.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep my manners".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience.
"Nobody knew", he said.
"My head was in a puddle, and tears were streaming down my face.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for overwhelming Christmas.
The feeling that he needed my love and my understanding.
I know I loved her very much".
Mourners hanging signs to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said her smile could light up any room".
However, he left his job before he died because he was in a "very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis stated, "I am continually concerned that there is a side effect".
Ms. Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people they can turn to, that they can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent, you have to speak".
Mrs Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said he was unwell or depressed or anything like that", she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in attitude.
It hit a low point on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their presents and he didn't look them in the eye or anything".
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to work on it: "It opens a hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to keep fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins an investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
With just five weeks to go until the November 6 midterm elections, if, as expected, the Republicans don't do well, they will be weakened in their ability to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call senators and pressing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI believes your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where, at present, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to overturn the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean defector numbers "fall" with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, said that 1,127 desertions occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increased prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Normally, the vast majority of North Korean defectors are offered South Korean citizenship.
Sources in Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants, rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards achieving a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves unilaterally first", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historian" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is a "historian" and that his temper makes him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted in this way, she would have been called a 'hysteric,'" Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, thrilled, denied allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes shouting and speechless as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee and said the charges against him were a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed his bias against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if she would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"This is what I can say: if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only are you not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, you are not qualified to be on the court where you are now", Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she considers herself a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he dodged questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the High Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to walk into court and expect us to look wonderful", Pelosi said.
Women have to exercise their power.
It's a justified diatribe: months and years of raging rage and can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that uncommon.
She continued: "It helped me a lot to have a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started to cry, saying to the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And then he would go on.
I thought it was brilliant".
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once ended up crying in an indescribable rage, is of an older woman (a cold, controlling woman who had always terrified me a bit) who grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the foot of the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy, because they'll have you".
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running herself as a candidate for president.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Somebody called it "Whitey and the Seven Dwarfs".
As she was late to the campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised that she would not enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who had given $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give $250 to her.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not be launching a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and for targeting voters instead of delegates, and anger, and sexism) that she was left speechless.
"You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled of the press reaction.
"You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking, What will they put in my grave?
"Did he cry?"
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The initial fallout from the US-China trade war was deafening, and while the war does not appear to be ending anytime soon, a detachment between the countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed tariffs on China's main exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of products, and these tariffs impose a tax on half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has repeatedly counterattacked in the same way, recently raising tariffs from five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has committed to replicating the U.S. and it's not likely that the world's second largest economy will back down anytime soon.
Giving Washington back means giving in to some demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that initiate a collapse in either country is far more dangerous than the witnesses had anticipated", says Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All conditions are met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or help from countries that funded the insurgency.
Europe's team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the opening shot into the water at the par 3 16th hole, which ceded the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all of his series and became one of only four players to have achieved a 5-0-0 record since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was dismissed with a 5&4 by the least qualified player of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's most skilled player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup winner Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time leading scorer with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the cup back.
The team is the most important thing... and I'm glad I was able to help", said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four matches he had in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players to ever play the game, with 14 major titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
There was a moment this morning when we pressed the European selection.
We fought.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have played very well.
We're gonna regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna make progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
You've got to take off your hat.
We have been defeated".
