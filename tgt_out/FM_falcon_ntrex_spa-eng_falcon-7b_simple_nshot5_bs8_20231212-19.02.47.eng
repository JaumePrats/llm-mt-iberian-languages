The Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM, for their English acronym) are worried about "looking like muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are perplexed by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for its English acronym).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Welsh Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Member of the Labour Party stated that his group was concerned "that it would stay with Twp and Pwp."
For the readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that the whole group was "dissatisfied" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales stated that their group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the change from MWP to muppet was "small."
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
In 2017, the Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which revealed widespread support for calling the National Assembly for Wales to Parliament.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the option MWP got the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, the Members of the Assembly are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring down the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who would have to send the bill for the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will have the last word on how they should be called when the Assembly deliberates on the legislation.
The Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum about changing the name of the country
Voters in Macedonia will decide on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Macedonia of the North."
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted that the name of its neighbor to the north implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent due to the difficulties of the churches of Harlem.
"Historically, the people I've talked to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner," says Mr. Adams.
“Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.”
He pointed out that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods that people go to regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "at some point, they will return to the starting point."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the type of people who will not help the shelters that are left in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and, therefore, they will accelerate the closing of these churches, since it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's Episcopal Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that was worshipping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took control of St. Martin's, under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were refusing to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while the parishioners of Father Johnson were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of the Father Johnson in San Martín, used to call them with pride "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who was playing the carillon called it: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the carillon at Riverside Church, the largest carillon, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martín did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing their concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the parish council, even though the council had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was bitten by a shark while diving for abalone in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the first day of the abalone season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child calling for help, so he swam over with a group to pull him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was "screaming that he had been bitten."
Hammel observed that the boy's clavicle was broken.
Hammel added, "I told everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark."
The child was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented in a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
The authorities closed the access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's Beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's beauty plans drive the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the aisles of their style and beauty stores.
In order to significantly boost the beauty market in the United Kingdom, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with a growth that is increasing in comparison with the decline of sales in fashion and household goods, the largest beauty retailers will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, will be rolled out in more stores the following year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be reserved for televisions, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury's announced that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup line with a majority of animal-friendly products.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will try out its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, in the south of London, last week. The second will open in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
The rise of online shopping and the shift towards daily purchases of small quantities of food in local stores forces supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that Sainsbury's stores will look more and more like shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered that this has boosted sales of food and has made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the chain of supermarkets to renew their beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over how to divide the profits from the sale of pharmaceutical products in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of the 281 pharmacies of Sainsbury's to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will be participating in the plan, adding a wider range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, commented: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to create an environment that enhances the shopping experience for our customers."
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a 11 million pound contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, went "furious" after Holly Willoughby broke an agreement worth 11 million pounds with his lifestyle business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to devote to the fashion brand and accessories Truly.
This business had compared with the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by leaving her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the girl of gold on television admitted that her new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to devote to Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the head office of her business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, aged 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
According to a source consulted: "Holly truly was, without a doubt, the main priority of Holly."
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her there for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved completely dumbfounded.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters, ready to be put on the market.
Experts believe that the exit of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes, and, possibly, delay its launch even more.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for the past ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, who is 52 years old, joined as president in March.
The couples were on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 % stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador for Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here on the ITV channel.
A source close to Jones said that last night "we didn't talk about business."
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up on so many things?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of a "news presenter".
"I haven't given up on anything."
He said that Kim is interested in meeting with him again after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a big step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for the nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the principal diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the leaders of the world gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an "adequate" response from the United States to its first steps toward denuclearization.
On the other hand, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
“We get along great with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
They would have killed millions of people.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of missile tests, help for the release of hostages and the return of the remains of U.S. soldiers killed in action.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing to the people standing right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was reported to foreign NGOs that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, there was no declaration of a national emergency, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” says Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will be sent to Palu, they still do not know if the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that the authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if it was safe to allow international organizations to provide aid.
Taking into account that the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami refuges have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a warning in advance, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, traveling from one island in Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the central theme of his election campaign, and has allocated quite a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is facing a reelection next year.
In addition, he must contend with the pressures of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim community have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while bands of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equalizes the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved the Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against the Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri that was about 27 meters from the goal of Chelsea when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot before kicking it to the second post.
The action sent the ball over the area and towards the top right corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to parry it with a jump and fell into the net.
“I was trying to get into that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kante was coming and I gave him a tap. I didn’t think too much about it, I just threw the ball.”
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The mediapunta of the Blues made a tacón pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning and making a dribble near the middle of the field and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and sprinted down the middle of the field.
After that, he made a nice pass to the space that led to Hazard in the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and kicked the ball into the net of the second post with a left-footed kick with his left foot that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
Wednesday at 15:00, the Liverpool plays against the Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will take place at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples (Italy).
On the other hand, Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of victims from the earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's disaster management agency at first light on Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of the buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and that triggered waves of up to six meters, according to the spokesman of the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the debris of the collapsed buildings.
The police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder of a woman after she was stabbed to death.
An investigation into murder has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, in Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, in John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect for murder.
The police have asked people in the area who may have seen or heard something to contact the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who may have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us."
In addition, I would recommend any person, especially taxi drivers, who may have been able to capture something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
Some people who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have informed that they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was perplexed when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to return to their homes in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
He keeps repeating, "It's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents were standing guard inside the cordon controlling the floors.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police on DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, reference number 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Oliver Cromwell in the House of Commons becomes the last commemorative success by "rewriting history."
Its prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by its fanatical puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestions of Mr. Crick as a "madness" and a "desire to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice the wrong Cromwell because of the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebrating.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy."
If it is a completely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing with the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has given shape to the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable face that represents a side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a herdsman in a market in the southwest of China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty at the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, as the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pigsty in Xining, in the province of Qinghai (China).
According to reports, she traveled with her cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in its mouth in the pigsty.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and mangled," said the cousin, who goes by the surname Wu.
Images from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or to his cousin.
A manager of the market told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It seems that the family of Yuan and the authorities of the market are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time that a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilos cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs aren't usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "disparator."
They're just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to do harm.
What needs to be done is to give them the respect they deserve.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rains in the southwest of the U.S.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the U.S. in the next few days.
Rosa caused gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, from Sunday at 5 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) and was located about 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move towards the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are starting to form, which are moving eastward towards the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday, a tropical storm will start to push the intense tropical rains northward, towards the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical downpour collides with the low pressure system that is approaching, there will be widespread heavy precipitation in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation rates of almost 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to receive between 5 and 10 inches of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in the greater part of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, it is possible that flash floods can occur suddenly with conditions that worsen quickly.
Due to the threat of torrential rains from tropical storms, it is not recommended at all to go on foot in the desert.
The heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and the storms could cause strong winds and local dust storms.
The approaching low-pressure systems will bring heavy rains to specific parts of the southern coast of California.
The torrential rains could leave as much as two inches of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make the roads slippery.
This would be the first torrential downpour of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical showers are expected to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and all day Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes can be observed in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warming of the tropics.
At other times, this can mean drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen in the entire center of the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and, Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of the summer will attempt to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the United States, it is expected that the beginning of October will be warm, with general temperatures that will range from 26 degrees Celsius in the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates above-average temperatures for the eastern half of the U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's testimony.
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, as they gave their testimonies before six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the politics continued to be at a standstill and the media interrupted their regular programming to retransmit the latest news from Friday: a deal designed by the senator from Arizona, Jeff Blake, for the FBI to carry out an investigation for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she has the absolute certainty that Kavanaugh groped her in a state of drunkenness and that he tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his impassioned testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely sure that that had not happened.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen's post on Friday have seen it.
The company tallied the average audience for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other channels that retransmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also tends to have some problems in estimating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it's like a Super Bowl or an Academy Awards ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, averaged 5,69 million viewers during a hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC occupied the second place, with 3,26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3,1 millions, the NBC had 2,94 millions, MSNBC had 2,89 millions and the CNN had 2,52 millions, according to Nielsen.
After the hearing, there was a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican released a statement saying it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the CNN and CBS cameras captured protesters yelling at Kavanaugh as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
As he received these reproaches, which were being broadcast live by CNN, he appeared dejected.
“Looking at my face,” said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
And she continued: "You have power when there are so many women who don't have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a press release and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at his appearance before the committee.
The cable and broadcast networks were airing everything in real time hours later, when the Senate Judiciary Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said that he would only do it if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the next week, which had been requested by some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, the Democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators later, Flake took his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation with the FBI regarding the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of "making politics" with the Brexit.
Theresa May, the British prime minister, accused her critics with her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and of undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British prime minister, arrives at the Conservative Party conference that will be held in Birmingham (United Kingdom) on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside hers on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect the other's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Assassination of Wayde: the police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of LSU player Wayde
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and jailed for a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made public a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and said that they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say that he admitted to having shot Wayde.
A bond of $350,000 has been set, according to the defense.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court released a preliminary report on Friday that indicated the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the criminalistics lab of the Louisiana State Police, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's director of athletics, thanked the local police force for their "diligence and search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was more than 2 meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, the basketball coach of LSU, declared that his team is "devastated" and "shocked" by the death of Wayde.
“These are the things that people always worry about,” said Wade.
A volcano spews ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods to the south of Mexico City.
The National Center for Prevention of Disasters warned the Mexican people to stay away from the volcano after it showed signs of activity and emitted 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center registered several tremors and quakes.
In social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after protesters clashed with the police while thousands of people took part in anti-independence demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and powdered paint at the riot police, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally filled with tourists.
There were also confrontations later in the day and the police used truncheons to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans like "No forget, no forgive," faced off against unionists, shouting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1, 2017, independence referendum, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose overwhelmingly for independence, although the turnout was low, as many people who were against secession boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at polling stations throughout the region, where there were violent confrontations.
The pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying tears of joy for being able to vote, but now we are stuck.
Despite winning a narrow victory in regional elections last December, the procatalanist parties have struggled to retain their momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident took place around 7:30 p.m. on Thursday.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there was damage to the access points and to the building itself.
At some point, it is possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured the victory
A Livingston promoted impressed the Rangers with their second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's team went up a place, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard's team have yet to win a game away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points' advantage.
Before, the Rangers play Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends its winning streak to six games in the division.
Livingston fails to capitalize on opportunities in front of a tough opponent
Holt's team had to have gone a step ahead much earlier, causing all kinds of problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defense, but missed his shot in front of the goal. After that, Alan Lithgow's shot went wide after he went in for a header from Craig Halkett in front of the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors by playing the ball at a standstill.
That's how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston looked for an opening, combining with Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that moment, the Rangers were in possession, but they couldn't get past the host's defense and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
The game continued until the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a stoppage of play.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers goalkeeper, saved a shot by Scott Pittman with a kick, and Lithgow was far away from another play by the Livingston.
In the Livingston area there were constant long passes, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one after a Halkett run on the substitute Glenn Middleton and the other after a hand.
“Fenomenal” from Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A fantastic performance and a great result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they played an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of a rising trajectory.
His style of play and his squad have hardly changed since his promotion, but this is largely due to the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was huge and directed a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
On the other hand, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good times with Gerrard, they were short-lived.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to get into the other team's field once, which is a call to attention to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Colonia
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of the Turkish President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's bid to join the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Colonia to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers showed up in the vicinity to see their president.
They were also heard by hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, who condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German-speaking Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has been killed in a car accident in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended to by the paramedics, but he died there and then.
The accident happened after a cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene in Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and it has been advised to drivers to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six agents injured during disturbances
Six prison officials have been injured in a fight that broke out in a high-security prison for men, according to the director of the prison.
The disturbances started in the prison of Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, at 9:30 in the morning and are still going on.
An elite team of specialists (called "Tornado") is in charge of controlling the disturbances, which involve eight patients and affect a ward.
The agents received assistance for minor injuries to their faces at the scene.
A spokesperson for the prison service says: "Specialist staff have been deployed to the prison to deal with the incident in progress at HMP Long Lartin."
Six members of the staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we have made it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.
Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison had received medical assistance after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, it was requested that riot police be sent to the prison to deal with a serious altercation in which the prison staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid regions could benefit)
It is very unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern Nevada, eastern California and southern Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind at the end of Monday.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix commented in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950."
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of torrential rains, which can reach up to 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollón Rim in Arizona.
It is likely that between 2 and 5 inches of rain will fall, with the possibility of up to 10 inches in isolated areas, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that do not run the risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains may be beneficial due to the drought conditions that are currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering, at least, extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported by weather.com.
In the first place, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which by Sunday morning will still be a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving northward at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
As a result, it is expected to weaken into a tropical storm by the afternoon of Monday.
Torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which run a high risk of flooding.
“Heavy rains of between 7 and 15 inches are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 25 inches,” as reported by weather.com.
After that, Rosa will head north towards Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona-Mexico border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression. Later, it will move southwards towards Utah by the end of Tuesday night.
The main danger of Rosa or its remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert.
It is expected that these rains will cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable."
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds, and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to the Avon and Somerset Police.
The police have made an appeal to anyone who may have recorded the incident with their mobile phone.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and the anger" of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the despicable and disgusting tactics of the Democrat Party,” said Trump at a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered through the meanness and the anger" of the Democratic Party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
In addition, Ford testified about this accusation in the session.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, "the American people saw the shrewdness, the quality, and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our day, a jurist with an admirable record of service to the public,” he said to his supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I am running a race.
"That's why I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
It is expected that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday, according to a high-ranking official of the Republican Party to CNN.
Hundreds of dead in a quake and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the enormous waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and a tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday night when waves of up to six meters arrived at the coast in the evening, dragging many to their death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When it was announced yesterday that there could be a tsunami, people were still on the beach and didn't leave immediately, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, in Indonesian) in a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it brought cars, trees, logs, houses, it destroyed everything that was on the ground," said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken bridges and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks were continuing to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in a region with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT, for its Indonesian acronym) informed in a press release that the energy released by the great earthquake of Friday was 200 times greater than the energy released by the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, they found bodies of some victims trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho pointed out that the number of victims and the damage could be greater along the 300 km of coastline to the north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, commented Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the officials say that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man can be heard warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water slams into the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great blackout that cut off communications in the area around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army started sending cargo planes with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic products.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for emergency and rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centers of Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although the staff of World Vision in Donggala have arrived safely in Palu, where they are sheltering under tarpaulins installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating scene on their way there, according to Mr. Doseba.
“They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as the aid groups put their gears in motion, some people were lamenting that the authorities were not allowing the free movement of experienced aid workers to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign aid, supplies and foreign personnel can be used in a disaster zone if it has been declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says this is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but that hasn’t happened yet.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing still had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolating stories that natural disasters write.
On Saturday, a small child was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor for the national paragliding team of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the people who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"Because of my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional baggage," he said.
Mr. Gendon remembered how, in the hours that followed the announcement that the hotel Roa Roa had collapsed in the community of parapenters, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival that was taking place on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a verification mark in grey, not two in blue.
"I think that means that the messages didn't get through," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a cash withdrawal at a Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, some thieves robbed an employee of Brink who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had just emptied an ATM machine located in the center of entertainment and was preparing to reload it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running up behind the employee of Brink" and stole a bag of money meant for reloading.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will now be known as Ye.
Kanye West announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West."
West, who is 41 years old, has been called Ye for some time now. Ye is the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will present his new album, Yandhi.
Replace the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance due to "emotional reasons", as commented by the creator of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, which means 'you'," commented West in the early part of this year while talking about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
It's you, it's us, it means us.
He went from being Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad, and confusing things, all.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred to be called Love and Brother Love.
An old collaborator of West's, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters or small letters, with or without a hyphen.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised not to use the army against the civilian population.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that he is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people in a moment when student movements in Latin America were strengthening.
López Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving them monthly stipends to study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U. S. should double its funding for I. A.
Now that China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional of I. A. who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after the announcements of several parts of the U.S. government, even though, in general, the U.S. does not have an official I. A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan a year ago: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for I. A. research would be a good start, given that all the other countries are lagging behind the U.S.," says Lee.
The doubling of funding means twice as many opportunities for the next great achievement in I. A. to happen in the U. S., as Lee stated in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important I. A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of I. A. that defeated the best American player of Othello. Later, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China office.
Lee recognized the previous competitions of the U.S. government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would take place, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers have to work hard to get funding from the government, said Lee.
"It's not China that's taking the leaders of academia; it's the corporations," Lee said.
In the last few years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired prominent researchers from universities to work on I. A.
Lee commented that some changes in U.S. immigration policy could also help intensify U.S. initiatives in I. A.
"I think that doctors in I. A. should have permanent residency cards automatically," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July of 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people at academic institutions just like the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the Department of Defense of the United States established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from industry and academia. On the other hand, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I. A. research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that was supposed to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence and Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum if they are going to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "Republic of Macedonia of the North", a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their bid for EU membership and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbor to the north is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the new name proposed, but the nationalists argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the participation will reach the 50 % minimum required for the referendum to be considered valid.
In the referendum ballot, the following question was asked: "Are you in favour of the accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to help Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79.
Although it will not be legally binding, many members of the Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote so that it will be decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds in the Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared that, at one o'clock in the afternoon, no irregularities had been reported.
However, participation was only 16 % in comparison with the 34 % of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when a 66 % of registered voters cast their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopie.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko deposited their vote in the referendum of Macedonia on a change of name of the country that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the EU in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament, in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from in front of the tents set up by those who would be boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not by the back door,” said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of the Euro-Asian integration.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, says that joining NATO would bring the investment that his country so badly needs, with the unemployment rate being over 20 %.
"I believe that the majority will be in favor, since more than 80 % of the citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Public Policy, between 30 and 43 % of voters were expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation.
A survey conducted by Telma TV, in Macedonia, revealed that 57 % of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 % said they would vote in favor.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, the participation rate must be at least 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policies of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from the Manchester City, evades the whole defense of the Brighton to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian midfielder received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three defenders of Brighton before entering the open field.
Once there, he found himself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded a defender before beating several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit the ball with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the goal.
“Agüero has some problems with his foot,” said Pep Guardiola, City’s coach, to the press.
We talked about playing for about 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League title race.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very deep in the territory of the Brighton.
He made a nice pass to the left side for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave a few taps to Sterling before directing him to the second mast.
The striker for the Sky Blues kicked the ball just before it went out of bounds.
The City faces the Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil the party for the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoff race, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer expects to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies clinched at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still seek their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the crowd in Denver will be excited and that the other team will probably be playing at the highest level that I have faced this year.
Why wouldn't you want to participate?
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but it looks like they are leaning towards starting Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who would be making his opening number 34, had a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The history of Washington's right-hander is 18 victories and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, as he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
In November, everything we have done is on the line.
There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the most important. I'm not running, but I'm working hard to get great candidates.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, they're doing it right now."
And they are determined to get their power back by any means necessary, you can see the meanness, the nastiness.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control. And we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, according to him, are embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
"We've seen this for the last four days," he said, saying that the Democrats were "angry, bad, horrible and false."
He made reference to the Senate Judiciary Committee nominating Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received boos from the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, "What?"
No, no mmm, I'm waiting for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of opinions.
He's intolerant of people who say what they think.
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour Members of Parliament who are told that we are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in the House of Commons, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not being in agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
He was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, for Europe. It is ironic that he was in disagreement with previous leaders on these matters.
As it was expressed in the notice of the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday, "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of the eight years that I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been like.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more friendly and compassionate" policy has already been forgotten, if it was ever really applied in the first place.
It is becoming more and more clear that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged in terms of whether the leaders of the party consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a similar political vision started to expect him to change his views radically and to adopt positions with which he had never been in agreement, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who has experienced this.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but never run away.
One of the most disheartening aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have such a wide range of opinions and, with each motion to censor or each change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to keep my head down and not make myself heard too much and that way "I would be all right."
But I haven't gotten into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, I have been motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left my secondary school in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my political ideas, not even in the last elections.
It is impossible that someone in Nottingham East did not know my political positions and the areas in which I did not agree with the current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday is that I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunistic politics will stop me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr remain unbeaten at the top
Two late tries at the end of the game may have decided the final result, but, without doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining game of the Tennent's Premiership.
Now they lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten that are participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defense, as well as their ability to make the most of the opportunities, which gave the local team the victory, so the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"They have put us to the test in all the games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy about that,"
Robyn Christie, from the Melrose, commented: "The Ayr deserves the recognition, they took their opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card shown to captain Rory Hughes, on loan from the Warriors for the match, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the numerical disadvantage and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Climo extended the lead of Ayr with a penalty. Before that, just at halftime, he scored and converted a solo try, which left the score at 17-5 in favor of Ayr at the break.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's conversion, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
There was a long stoppage due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, and, when the game resumed, Ayr took the lead with a try by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of having one more man on the pitch with a penalty not converted by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for placating Climo without the ball, from the line of scrimmage, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing almost since the game restarted, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong's punt and sent Gregor Henry into the corner for the fifth penalty kick.
The star of Still Game wants to direct his career towards the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restaurant business after revealing that he has been named the director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-stars with his comedy partner of many years, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to make any comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "thriving restoration market" of Glasgow.
“The sea belongs to us”: a Bolivia without a coastline has the hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Navy marines guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
Flags are flying at half-mast in public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right."
It is a duty to recover it."
In all of Bolivia, a land without a sea, people still remember vividly the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict for the resources that took place in the 19th century, as well as the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1st, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and calmness and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the failure of the International Court of Justice on large screens spread throughout the country, hoping that the International Court of Justice in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is locked in a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has a lot to say about the resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the tribunal will rule in Bolivia's favor and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands does not have the power to adjudicate territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the resolution of the International Court of Justice came only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have actually hindered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
In addition, he suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales has eroded any residual good will in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have conversations after this.
The two countries do not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will offer Chile "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "putting an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", said.
In addition, Calzadilla denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political tool.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see what we need to leave behind.”
North Korea says it will not give up its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to give up its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He urged the U.S. to live up to the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rivals.
His comments come as Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, appears to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic talks on nuclear issues with Kim Jong U, the leader of North Korea.
Ri says that the continuation of the sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korean War is a "quixotic" dream.
Washington is wary of accepting Pyongyang's declaration without first seeing some significant disarmament movement.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's offer to give up its nuclear arsenal, which the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is expected to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The fashion parades in Paris reveal the last line of enormous hats that are about to land in a shop near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, you need look no further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the runway.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a wide-brimmed beige hat adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large accessories included watermelons with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of outlandish masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn-up lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a diving team, complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're in luck.
The hunters of style predict that the huge hats could start to be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats are coming strong from "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimetres used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand behind this impractical hat that flooded the social networks presented another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the model wearing it.
The orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia tassels and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the La Riviera collection by Jacquemus for the spring-summer 2019 season at the Paris Fashion Week.
As Luke Armitage, the stylist to the stars, told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories."
John Edward: linguistic skills are fundamental for citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have a long history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these independent schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for its acronym in English), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
The purpose of independent schools is to prepare their students for further education, for the career they choose, and for the place they will occupy in the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, the message goes to his heart."
If you talk to them in their own language, it reaches their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries, you can't rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the classification tables, with the pass rates being the highest in independent schools.
In total, 68 % of the students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that make up the SCIS, showed that 72 % of the students got an A in Mandarin, while 72 % of the students who studied German, 69 % of the students who studied French, and 63 % of the students who studied Spanish also got an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support the teaching of foreign languages because they see them as a fundamental skill that children and young people will definitely need in the future without a doubt.
Today, it is considered that languages are at the same level as the CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the Commission for Employment and Skills in the United Kingdom revealed that, of the reasons given by employers on the difficulties they faced in filling jobs, 17 % were attributed to the lack of linguistic skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming more and more essential for preparing young people for their future careers.
The possible employment opportunities that require language skills are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last their whole life.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to get ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 % of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. It was also established that the only foreign language spoken by a two-digit percentage, the 15 %, was French.
For this reason, investing in the teaching of languages now is important for children of today.
If children know more than one language, especially those of developing economies, they will be better equipped to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Some centres will focus on the classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools they can choose between several languages taught by specialist teachers in this field.
Scotland's independent schools devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have an important role to play in the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, the modern languages must be considered "competencies for international communication."
The independent schools in Scotland will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You've got to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron James makes his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for the fans who are waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, has announced that James will play in the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
However, it is yet to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
The reporter for the Lakers, Mike Trudell, tweeted that it was likely that James would play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game pre-season schedule of the Lakers.
In this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare myself.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five Trump campaign rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation of his candidate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court in waiting, Trump intends to obtain support for the next mid-term elections, since the Republicans run the risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see it online through a live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on this week's hearings of the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, which were tense due to sexual misconduct allegations and have left the Senate in limbo for, at most, a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans who are facing the elections in November to gain momentum.
Thus, the Trump campaign announced that the five rallies scheduled for next week are meant to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
“The control of the Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the campaign,” said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named.
The rally scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as having coverage in the Pittsburgh media.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters, "For Morrisey, it's not a good sign that the president has to come to West Virginia to give him a push in the polls."
Ryder Cup 2018: the U.S. team shows that it is willing to fight to keep alive the hope of facing the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept in sports, but the players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
Then, where would they say the impulse is now?
“We were six points behind and now we’re four points behind, so I guess you could say that’s a little bit of a push,” said Jordan Spieth after the round.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more to play for.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel they have the wind at their backs and plenty of reasons to be optimistic, among other reasons because of the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and earned four points out of a possible four.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee to the green and preaches with example.
The guttural roars of celebration rose in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth round when he and Thomas were two down with two to play.
The putt that gave them the win in the 15th hole was received with a similar cry, one that conveys that the US team has not yet been eliminated.
"What we need to do now is redouble our efforts and concentrate on the game," said Spieth.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe have won four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple that did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening, and the last nine holes of Friday morning.
This run of form and the way their energy flows with the boisterous crowd makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, in two different holes at the same time.
Even so, it is still premature to speak of the European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio García, the hero of the four-ball match in the morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two aces in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help to get out of the holes on Sunday.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch up close because you can see the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the U.S. team is not afraid to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe is ahead by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good lead going into the final day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a score of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods who was in trouble, leading by four points in the Le Golf National classification.
Europe's Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that committed many errors during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but was not able to shorten the distance.
The American Jim Furyk needs to obtain eight points out of the 12 individual games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership served to defeat a despondent Woods and a rookie American Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who did not stand out too much in the two matches on Saturday, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome matches, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to be the partner of Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and number three players in the world respectively, with a result of 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and calm in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spaniard Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has come back from a four-point deficit in the individual matches only twice, but Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for the last two days, it seems that mounting a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that "there is no possibility" of disarming first unilaterally if they do not have confidence.
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened their mistrust of the United States and that there was no possibility that they would renounce their nuclear armament unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared before the General Assembly of the international organization that North Korea had adopted "important measures of goodwill" over the course of the past year, such as ceasing nuclear tests and missile launches, dismantling nuclear test sites, and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we did not receive a similar response from the United States.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no chance that we will disarm unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated the well-known complaints of North Korea about the resistance of Washington to a "phased" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, since he did not reject a unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between a U.S. president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, 2018, when Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the U.S. has said that Pyongyang must renounce its nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington has resisted calls to soften the international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. has insisted on nuclear disarmament first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a declaration of termination of the war," Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a fantasy of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our mistrust.
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced with great fanfare by the U.S. president at the U.N. General Assembly a few weeks ago.
Instead of that, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the interested party in the denuclearization of the peninsula instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct the missiles of North Korea towards US soil after the "malignant president" Trump, on a suicidal mission, called Kim "rocket man".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said that there was still much to do and that sanctions would have to be applied until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward North Korea for its advances.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, "The sanctions imposed by the Security Council must continue energetically and in full compliance until we realize a complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions unanimously on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for the country's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then commented that he would return to Pyongyang in a month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea announced that its "demands were those of a gangster."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea agreed to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. took “corresponding measures.”
He said that Kim had told him that the "measures" he was looking for were the guarantees of security that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep.
Thanks to a new course that is being taught this year at Harvard University, all the students are sleeping more in an attempt to fight against the growing culture of studying all night drinking coffee.
A professor discovered that the students of the number one university in the world do not have any idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how lack of sleep affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was just finding out about this now, at the end of her last year.
He said that no one had ever spoken to him before about the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were barely sleeping during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, running shoes, and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
After that, an icon of the campus with interactive icons animates the participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that this is not going to change the behavior of the students immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco.
He said that the culture of pride for "staying up all night" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure students are under meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and a good night's sleep should be "the secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since lack of sleep makes the brain generate a feeling of hunger, so that they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after having attended one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
I hope that the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
The recommendation of the professor Czeisler is that students think about putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of the electronic devices and the LED, which can alter the circadian rhythms, so that they would have problems falling asleep.
Rangers 1 - Livingston 0: Menga's goal sinks Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression away from home, when the attack of Dolly Menga despatched the disarticulated team of Steven Gerrard to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Rangers wanted their first win away from home since February's 4-1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat them for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack took place a few minutes before half-time and the uninspired Rangers line-up was not up to the task.
Now, the Rangers go down to the sixth position, the Livingston go up to the third position, behind the Hibernian by the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as judge of the line Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance after apparently being hit in the head by an object thrown from the visitor's side.
Gerrard changed eight of the eleven players who won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt took 11 players from Livingston who drew 1-1 with Hearts last week and would have been happy with the way his organized team suffocated their opponents throughout the match.
The Rangers may have had more possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have marked at two minutes into the game when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman who passed through the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs committed a foul in the penalty area for the captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, could only send it out for a corner kick.
The Rangers recovered the control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson turned a deaf ear to the Colombian's request.
The Rangers got two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble dealing with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's long-range shot.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston was against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Once again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a deep pass from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and passed the ball to Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the winger passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block it.
Even so, Livingston continued to lead the visitors exactly to the type of game that he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing the way with long passes.
Holt could have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stayed firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow rounded off a corner header that didn't go in.
The substitute for the Rangers, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and COUNTING... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which since then has become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 movie "The Bells of Coronado", with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of scientists cowboys:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium."
When you put on the earphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity emitted by the minerals.
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells.
A new vaccine against cancer may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancerous cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a common protein in many cancers and re-inject them.
A clinical trial of the vaccine is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and, subsequently, reinjecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer", such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained the professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancerous cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a diatribe in favor of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't come out well.
Kanye West was booed off the set of Saturday Night Live after an erratic performance in which he praised President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times I speak with someone white and they ask me how I can like Trump if he is racist.”
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago.
Saturday Night Live started the show with a sketch in which Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in relation to the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the comedian Chris Rock posted the recording of West's tantrum on social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West with the publication.
In addition, West said to the audience that he had a bad time on stage because he was wearing that hat.
They came after me.
They told me not to go out with my hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm sleeping," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and added that he was "going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant that no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to advance?"
Try with love.
His comments received boos from the audience at least twice, and the members of SNL seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many when he came out on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING AGAINST THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I decide not to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes, or supporting their art) who I think is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.”
He's free.
We, too,
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he was "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
This is not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as P Diddy, Puff Daddy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the late legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
It is expected that the accused will appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecutor's office will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, who is 31 years old, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those roles on screen often transmitted to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit Harington, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he thinks it's "fairly important" to address this issue.
"Personally, I think it's quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?"
"What have we been teaching our men while they were growing up, thinking about the problems that we see now?"
Kit believes that television can have a part of the responsibility for the increasing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on television, and in the streets, that makes young men feel that they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of the young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he thinks knowing his wife, Rose, is the best thing he has taken away from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose was cast as Ygritte, the love interest of Kit Harington's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at a farm belonging to Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports of a 14 % increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14 % in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, there are more than 820,000 people affected, according to the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of these were infected through sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread quickly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced in its entirety, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference held in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100 000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGTB community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB community still suffers from a lot of discrimination.
Due to the conservative nature of the country, studies have calculated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases are due to not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to anti-retroviral drugs as part of an effort to confront the problem.
Representative Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data to Republican senators and states that it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Representative Maxine Waters criticized Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles stated that those accusations were being driven by right-wing commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more vile lies,” commented Waters in a tweet.
Apparently, the information published included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, a person unknown to the Capitol published the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Filtration took place at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the posts was associated with Waters's office, and made public the data of a member of Waters's staff, according to the Capitol.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
The member of my personal staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters's statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including from the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Denies this information with anger," wrote Fleischer.
This suggests a lack of the necessary temperance to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
Don't rebel.
The defendant should not question the motives of the accuser.
He must maintain his calm and serenity.
It seems that Fleischer was trying to compare the reaction of Waters to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during his testimony on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who hopes to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and the entities charged with the enforcement of the law" to the allegations of fraud.
"We will make sure that the authors are discovered," he continued, "and that they are considered legally responsible for all of these destructive and dangerous actions against all of my staff members."
Review of Johnny English: Again in Action. Rowan Atkinson's parody of the spy fails to deliver
Now it has become a tradition to look for guffaws at the Brexit in any new movie with a British focus. It seems that this is what you should do with this new installment of the parodic action and comedy Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satire be the new opportunity for exporting the nation's insanity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his license for the second time. Just his name already gives away that, more than anything else, it is a comedy created for non-English speaking territories.
Of course, it's the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions of squandering glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that type who touched a single note in the theme of Chariots of Fire that touched a single note in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious man traveler and international represented years ago by Atkinson in the forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last episode, there are a couple of good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed as a medieval knight while the helicopter's rotors hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps off the screen, but the humor is a bit short and is oddly superfluous, especially now that franchises like James Bond and Mission: Impossible are adding comic ingredients without problems.
The humor seems to be more directed to children than to adults, and for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as clever and accurate as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the oft-repeated argument is that Britain is in deep trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of spies of Great Britain, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent in service, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the straw that breaks the camel's back for the prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who is watching her popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That has to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, although he also teaches extra-curricular classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since it is a spy academy similar to the one in School of Rock.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets up with his old friend Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submariner captain, a role that he doesn't take advantage of enough with Vicki Pepperdine.
So, the Batman and Robin that do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of Her Majesty return to action, with the beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a charismatic multi-millionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve the IT problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a fancy French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Undoubtedly, they put a lot of effort into that last sequence, but, however funny and noisy it may be, the whole thing still has a somewhat childish feel to it.
A fairly regular product.
Just like with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would truly do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is working on a plan to have Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but they would be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants the owners of the companies to use the savings obtained from the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to give their workers an additional day off.
So, the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "would fit in" with the party's economic agenda and would favor workers.
This change to a four-day work week has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a high-ranking Labour Party official commented to The Sunday Times: It is expected that a review of the directive will be announced before the end of the year.
“We won’t be able to achieve this overnight, but the four-day work week is definitely a question that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, for the time being, not all of the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not part of the Labour Party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this time."
The shadow chancellor of the exchequer, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference that took place last week to expound his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover the powers of "anonymous directors" and "beneficial owners" of companies that provide public services.
One of the shadow minister's plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies will not get back all of their shares, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to the irregularities perceived.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and create inclusive property funds in which 10 % of the shares of private sector companies would have to be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to £500 for them.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak on "60 Minutes" about the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh and if it could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed at least a week the final vote on his confirmation as a judge on the Supreme Court and, in addition, raises the question of whether the results of the investigation could influence any Republican senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.”
I called him after all of this happened, after the allegation came out, and I asked him: "Did you do it?"
He was firm, resolute, and unyielding.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be immovable.
“I’ve already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I’d ignore the accusation,” she said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it tajantely,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people named by her has been able to confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it been able to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together a star-studded lineup in support of an equally star-studded mission: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will move to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real objective of the event: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
If you would like to receive a free entry to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), attendees to the concerts have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or any other thing that serves to raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved after 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of "clicktivism", which refers to the position we adopt when we think we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favor of a large number of different objectives.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have achieved commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from their actions, of which, at least 10 000 million $ have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition," an association of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom with the common goal of "helping children grow and develop to their full potential." With this in mind, they have pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen collaborators.
Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, the donors, the national governments and collaborators of Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we think can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and difficult road and, in many cases, we will stumble and fall."
But, as they have already succeeded in the movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will have at the New York event this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of Russian energy exports - Department of the Interior
In case necessary, Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent the Russian energy from shaking the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States, Ryan Zinke, according to what is published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates on behalf of the legitimate government, is no more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the main supplier of energy to Europe.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods of dealing with this issue.
"The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to guarantee that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that the energy does not end up in the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the consumer energy industry" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington has taken in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
"The alternative economic model in Iran and Russia consists, basically, of exploiting and replacing fossil fuels," he warned at the same time that he indicated that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to promote the exportation of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this purpose, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the gas pipeline to $22 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin defends that the fervent opposition of Washington to the project responds only to economic motives and is another example of unfair competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot be converted into a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said the Minister of Energy of Russia, Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the Secretary of Energy of the United States, in Moscow in September 2017.
The U.S. position has found itself, however, with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization that leads the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the U.S. not to intervene in the energy policy of the EU nor in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a meeting that took place recently between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibility of running for president in 2020, says the senator from Massachusetts.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Saturday that she will study the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
During a hearing at the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering this challenge.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and to finally have women among our leaders,” she said, as reported by The Hill.
After the 6th of November, I am going to seriously consider the possibility of running for president.
Warren gave her opinion on President Donald Trump during a press conference at the City Hall and stated that "he was taking the country down the wrong path."
"I'm really worried about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren spoke openly about Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from last Friday, Warren asserted that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
However, a majority of Warren's own supporters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run.
A 32% of the respondents supported, however, his candidacy.
In the poll, 38% of respondents expressed support for the current governor, Deval Patrick, while 48% expressed opposition.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for 2020 of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
26-year-old Track Palin served a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation that my son is going through, everything that has happened to him since he came back, you know very well the effects that the TEPT and other wounds have on the families of our soldiers,” said to the public that gathered in a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that nobody wants to talk about, and commented about her son and other veterans of war that "they come back with a different behavior, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and interfering with a domestic violence complaint, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's new policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker who is currently facing the current directive, according to NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" presented in August by the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) in opposition to the federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and his children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but the U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers who represent these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum requests to the U.S., as nations that face generalized problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States revoked a decision of 2014 taken by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA, for its acronym in English) by which undocumented immigrants who flee domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made some statements on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum requests must be denied on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the particular claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle.
In addition, the lawyers pointed out in the letter that the policy that denies entry to immigrants hurts the economy of the U.S. by asserting that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and "represent a necessary workforce."
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on June 11, 2018, that asylum seekers can now apply for protection in the U.S.
The asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people all over the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead increases in a race to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby at a relief center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute more ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search through the few belongings they have left in an effort to recover what they can.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Hospital of the Indonesian Army in Palu, where the patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous aftershocks, also very strong.
I couldn't help but cry when she told us about the violent earthquake that she lived through while she was on the 5th floor of the hotel with her wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the debris of the collapsed wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife ask for help, and then a terrible silence.
I don't know what's happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are all right.
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
One week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper touting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, made reference to the supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the elections to the Congress of the United States on November 6, something that China denies in a very clear way.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence U.S. elections marked a new phase in a growing U.S. campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led both sides to increase tariff levels on imports from each other.
The compensatory tariffs that China applied at the beginning of the trade war were designed to fall on exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and business people.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China is "intensifying that pressure even more by running ads in our free press."
To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by trying to publish an ad in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, in the newsstand on the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that the people of China can have on the worrying trajectory that their economy is taking, since the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Communist Party of China.
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts point out that the Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle.
As many Republicans of note are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that this could lead to a backlash, especially among women, in the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense, and many Republicans have stated that they want to move forward with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI's investigation will be enough to calm the disgruntled voters on this issue.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they’re not going to forget tomorrow, or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered at the doors of the Senate were chanting "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) at the moment when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to go ahead with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by the Mic.
Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, said, "The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is way out of the ballpark."
People say that the impact is already very relevant and, in fact, that is so.
But it could be even greater, especially among the indecisive voters from the outskirts of the city and the younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who don't usually vote even though they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which she detailed in great detail her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts indicated that there could be a backslide if the Republicans continued ahead with the confirmation.
“This has turned into a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as reported by NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or even if they sit on the bench with Kavanaugh; it's also about how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they've treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helps elect Democrats).
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who are on Kavanaugh's side.
In a new YouGov poll, it is indicated that 41% of the respondents believe Ford's testimony definitively or probably, while 35% believe Kavanaugh's testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38 % said they thought Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while 30 % said the same of Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements as well as at least those of another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while she was drunk at the age of 17.
On the other hand, Ramirez claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitals to him at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is putting together a new company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the legend of technology. A company that is based on the open source code platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention that lies behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world."
“It has to be now,” he said about the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses the technology of Solid to allow users to create their own "personal data storage space" or a POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, the calendar, the music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available in the same browser at the same time.
One thing that is exclusive to online personal data storage is that the user is the one who decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal data training through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and the skills necessary for Solid to reach the whole world.
For the moment, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers included in the staff that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools that are available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking with "Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce or not a radical change where all their business models are going to be completely modified from one day to the other."
"We're not going to ask permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate over the neutrality of the Internet.
Even though Berners-Lee is launching Inrupt, he will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee said he was "incredibly optimistic" about the next era of the web.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years after his death.
Lt. Col. Rev. Bernard Vann received this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest honor in the British military.
On Saturday, the couple's two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons."
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", he advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking out three of the detachment.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was accompanied by the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the true value of a genuine hero becomes apparent when he is shown such a strong show of support."
The MMA fans stayed up all night for the Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig.
Imagine that he stays up all night to watch the entire Bellator 206 so that at the end they don't let him see the main event.
The San José card had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when the program suddenly changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a really bad joke."
“There is a government regulation that governs what can be broadcast from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when we asked him about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig", yes."
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they are going to modify the program to include the British audience in the next editions.
"When I think about the option of a live broadcast, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it's 6 a.m. on a Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, there were a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise that the next time it won't happen.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, which is what we normally do. We tried to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we did.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but this was what motivated him to become a champion.
At 24 years old, she told us that she didn't realize it until she got to high school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first episode of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in talking about gay rights was to "transmit hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to put less importance on winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this mythical program, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne, Daley, who showed himself as an outcast, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
She said: "Until today, the feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to show that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games held in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he told his story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to transmit that "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that it was also a surprise for her to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married last year the winner of an Oscar, who is 20 years older than her, although she specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you live so much from such a young age (she was at her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows that you have.”
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "global perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me a year ago, all my answers would have been about 'I have to win a gold medal'," she said.
But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal from the Olympics is, without a doubt, Robbie's.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had the tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the first row.
She said, "I couldn't tell him I couldn't be in the first row."
“I had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"In that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better," she said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him during the preparation for the Olympic Games. He still got goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, sat on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad statistic.
Mickelson, who was playing in the event that takes place every two years to try to get a record 12th time, was beaten by the captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he has been so many times for the United States, the five-time major champion had to content himself with cheering in some moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what ails him.
Never the most direct of drivers, not even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough punishes errant shots.
And, if the field wasn't challenging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match of the Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches that they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, had started off in such an impressive fashion, Phil Mickelson's match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, but he could not say much more.
Furyk understood perfectly the role he had to play today, gave me a pat on the back and said he would be ready for tomorrow.
He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, just like the rest of them.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break the record of Nick Faldo for the most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could have been the last of a career of Ryder Cups that had never been so clearly defined by his individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 ties, although Furyk said that his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, clever, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It adds a lot more than just playing.
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the leadership can disappear very soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, even if you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, you can easily turn it into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 Ryder Cup at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end only managed to finish with the other team's heels by a minimum margin, winning 14½-13½.
."
The story will teach me and the rest of the world that this team is not finished.
You've got to give it everything tomorrow.
Get out of here and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, which are the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players have done on a very difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to get ahead of myself."
Tomorrow will be a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are the individual performances and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, you really put your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message that has to be sent to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it's time to leave your partner behind, and go and get the best out of yourself.
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as a pair, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points to four.
The same Furyk has been on both ends in the last few days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won in Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
We have 12 superimportantes matches tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all advance in the same direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parts.
We defined our strategy and made them feel like we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.
We assigned Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and face off against Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole route,” said Bjorn about his individual selections.
The new German warship has been postponed again.
The new frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old frigates of the Cold War era, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, according to local media.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that leads the new class of Baden-Württemberg frigates, has been postponed now until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery delayed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates requested by the German Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of air-to-air missiles and anti-missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar signals, infrared and acoustic signatures, which are very reduced.
Some of the most important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative warships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the oceans) will already be out of date when they go into service, as Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It has been the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Very little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if it was sent on a combat mission.
Deficiencies in software were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half the crew that had been on the old frigates of the class Bremen.
In addition, it was found that the ship has an excessive weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is twice as heavy as other ships of the same class that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached 3.1 billion € (3.6 billion $), instead of the initial 2.2 billion €.
The problems that are being attributed to the new frigates are of special relevance in light of the recent warnings about the reduction in the power of the German navy.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy is "running out of ships that can be deployed."
The official said that the problem has been getting worse over time, because the old ships have been decommissioned, but they have not been replaced with new ones.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of the bats
This new research, which has been carried out in the Highlands of Scotland, is trying to find out how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is hoped that what is discovered will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide the next conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton's bats and brown long-eared bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in strategic locations on the property to monitor the activities of the bats during the season.
The template and volunteers from the NHS will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
The experts will analyze the sounds recorded in the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the bats and what species make them.
Then a report and a map of the habitat will be produced to create a detailed image of the environment and of its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, is hoping that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to the bats and how each species uses them.
With this information, it will be possible to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how they should be maintained for bats and other species associated with them.
The populations of bats in Scotland and in the United Kingdom have decreased considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
The wind turbines and the electrical cabling can also pose a risk to them, as well as insecticides and other chemical treatments of the construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful to them than their eyes in finding their prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocalization that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the matter, who carry out regular surveys, inspections of nests and, in some cases, rescues.
The organization has even inaugurated the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in Scotland in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says that it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees, and all the right habitat.
However, there are still many things unknown about bats, so the work that we do here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop.
He points out the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance work inside properties, as it is possible to accidentally destroy a colony of breeding bats and kill up to 400 females and their young, which would mean wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we don't know how they evolve their populations."
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape at the same time that his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has cataloged the allegations of rape as "fake news," and says that people "want to be known" at the expense of his name.
The lawyers have been instructed to file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping a woman from the United States, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of having paid 375 000 $ to hide the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video of Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, tarnished the report as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false," says the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or, looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to make themselves famous just by mentioning me, but it is so, I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations that appear in what they have called "an inadmissible report on suspicions of privacy", according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will try to get compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in the last few years."
According to reports, the supposed incident took place in June of 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After getting to know each other in a night club, supposedly, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's room and there he, allegedly, raped her anally, according to the documents registered in the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt down after the supposed incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had only disappointed him with the "one percent" remaining.
In the documents it is stated that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took pictures of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "terrified of reprisals" and worried about "being humiliated in public".
The woman, who is 34 years old, says she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has changed to Juventus, a big name in Italian football for a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: the United Kingdom would regret losing car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom would "regret it for the rest of its life" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
Mr. Clark said, "We need an agreement."
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at the border in the case of a Brexit without a deal could result in the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Auris and Avensis models for Toyota, produced 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that, if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be parones of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the general director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers from the United Kingdom have shown their fears in relation to the exit of the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after the Brexit.
The main concerns that the car manufacturers are referring to are the problems that could arise in the factories in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is based on the "just in time" method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars by order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be a disruption at the border, which, according to the sector, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day's worth of inventory in its Derbyshire plant, the company said and, in such a case, production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan of Theresa May, where the future relations with the EU are established, is "precisely calibrated to avoid those controls at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of this moment well but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4 program Today.
"Toyota's evidence shows that we have to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a very successful supply chain."
Toyota has not been able to say for how long it would stop production, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, in the end, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the plant for 24 years and is the shop steward for Unite at the plant, said his members are becoming more and more concerned: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that sets out our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be postponed another week, as the dispute over the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, connections between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not and, in this way, compromise the independence of Mueller has fueled the gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone that he himself carried to try to get rid of the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, on Monday he was at the White House, among news where it was reported that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the vote of the full Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "We haven't set a date, it could be this week or it could be another, considering everything that's happening with the Supreme Court."
We'll decide as we go along and I'll be informing the press as I usually do.
Some journalists would refute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10th.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the shortage of press passes was not due to a dislike of TV reporters who act grandiloquently, although he said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they fanfaronade."
Following that, she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president has more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him," he said, while citing without evidence: "We've compared those numbers."
The press briefings will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly to the president of the United States, I think that's much better than asking me."
We've tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press briefings with the dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him alone are very rare.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why, where he made a casual and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled press.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to the staff of the NHS in Scotland about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the staff of the EU agency working in the HHS of Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and its desire for them to continue working with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens who work in public services that are not dependent on the central government.
In her letter, the Sra. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit took place in which it was expected that the decisions would be taken this autumn.
However, the government of the United Kingdom has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario in which there would be no agreement.
I know that all of this must be very confusing for you.
And it is for this reason that I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each and every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count on you.
A Christion Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, a player for the Tennessee State Tigers was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennesse.
The coach of Tennessee State University, Rod Reed, informed the press that the injury occurred just before the break.
“He came to the band and collapsed right there,” Reed said.
Both the coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A member of the staff of the Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 for the entire season.
Foreigners will have to pay a higher rate of stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK.
A foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to give shelter to the homeless.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters.
The increase in the transmission of land tax will be applied to those people who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year which will be used to help the homeless.
The additional money raised by the increase in stamp duty for foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the homeless, announced Theresa May today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to ease the burden on those with higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty on property will be levied on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to incentivise the government's policy to combat begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, also includes the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, which could reach up to 3 %.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of new properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which causes prices to rise and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder.
Many of the more affluent areas of the country (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping the prices very high for the properties by buying land without any intention of using it and asked the Sra. May to get rid of the fees that are applied to affordable homes to solve the "shameful problem of housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, among which are controls on rent and the end of evictions without cause.
He also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
The Prime Minister's wife, Mrs. May, said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life chances of every new generation."
And that means solving the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the working class in Britain.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult to achieve for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland."
The coach of Sunderland says that his "primary objective" is to become the coach of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the possibility of reviving the north-east club, which at the moment occupies the third place in the League One (the third division of English football), three points away from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Premier League for the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.”
But I only managed to get a B hat," he said on Sportsound on the BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child and it's something that has always made me want to go back.
This opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I am able to successfully direct a club.
Among the predecessors of Ross as the manager of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any fear when he turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
In this moment, the success for me is measured by whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club correspond, without a doubt, to those of the Premier League."
“It’s not easy to achieve, but I would consider that I have achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it should be.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after being an assistant at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the technical staff of Hearts.
After that, he helped the Alloa recover from their relegation to the third division and helped the St. Mirren avoid relegation and win the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims that he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
I've always thought that direction was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, because I was good at it, I could make a living with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But it can be very hard to play.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I've always wanted to train and now I've achieved it, this is the time of my adult life when I've felt better, without a doubt.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Monday, September 30th, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the perfect time to have a pint is at 5.30pm on a Saturday.
The heatwave of the summer has pushed up the profits of British pubs that are struggling to survive, but focused all the pressure on the chains of restaurants.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8%, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, from the consultancy firm CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup has meant that in July the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased by 2.8% their profits, while restaurants have fallen even more.
The fall of 1.8% in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly serve alcoholic drinks had their best month, compared to the majority of restaurants, where they reduced their profits.
The pubs that mainly serve food also suffered with the heat, although not to the same extent as the restaurant operators.
It seems that people only want to go out to drink.
In bars and pubs managed, sales of drinks rose by 6.6 % during the month, while sales of food fell by 3 %.
Paul Newman, a hospitality and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April."
Time and the impact of important social or sporting events continue to be the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful in view of the continuing pressures on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, which reflects the slow decline in brand implantations.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the restaurant, bar and pub sector in the UK, the data is collected and analysed for 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9000 million.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that their parents don't know about.
One out of every five children (some even as young as 11 years old) have secret accounts on social media that their parents and teachers do not know about, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages.
The news has sharpened fears that sexually explicit material will be published.
20% of the students said they have a "main" account that they show to their parents
One out of every five children (some even as young as 11 years old) create accounts on social media that hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has sharpened fears that sexually explicit content will be published.
20% of the students said that they had a "main" account that they showed to their parents, as well as having other private accounts.
A mother who happened to come across her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenage boy was encouraging others to "violate" her.
The investigation, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of directors of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to form part of the board of directors of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in track and field in Scotland and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want to see the sport benefit from her great international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognised and respected in the whole community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from her being in charge," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help to develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now is a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him without the ability to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I suffered a cerebrovascular accident."
He couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell if I would recover or to what extent I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn how to walk again and now I'm doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!
The announcement of the breastpump where they compare mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A breast-pump company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares mothers who breast-feed with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "world's first silent breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music that shows mothers talking about the freedom that the new breast pump gives them.
Four real women dance in a barn full of hay as a dance floor, along with some cows, with signs like: "Yes, I can milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues to say: "Feed them, feed them, I'm feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I'm feeding my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has created a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions of all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say that it puts the focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to be able to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after giving birth.
The Elvie breast pump adapts discretely in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and for the baby."
But, yes, why not use them to announce an extractor of milk for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a crazy announcement."
However, other people defended the ad, like a woman who admitted that the song was "annoying."
I think that's a great idea.
If she were still breastfeeding, I'm sure she'd have one.
When I used the pump, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit over the top, but I don't give it any more thought.
It's a great product,” we were told by a woman.
Another person told us: "It's a funny ad directed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows."
In the ad, there is no praise or criticism of the dairy sector.
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreetly placed bombs inside their brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump their milk with a pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to a nursing bra, which makes it possible for its users to move, hold their babies, and even go out in public with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, social and ECD of Mother, tells us: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved an audacious and provocative launch."
By showing the parallelism between expressive women and lactating cows, we wanted to call attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minors discreetly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied minors detained has experienced a significant increase, despite the fact that the monthly inflow at the border has remained at the usual levels. In part, this is due to the harsh rhetoric and the policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, the majority of godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take in a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
Around 80% of the sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we are still pursuing these people," said Albence.
In their rush to process minors more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum of one month from their arrest, instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to the workers at the centers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before a judge in immigration cases.
Those who are not considered to be eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to workers at the centers and reports from the system that have emerged over the last few months, the longer they are held in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, the signs of distress in these children will be overlooked.
In addition, the transfer to the camp without having given them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them to suffer a trauma that many of them are already suffering.
Syria asks the "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the vice prime minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the matter "will be dealt with accordingly."
“They must be withdrawn immediately and without conditions,” he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would "continue to fight this sacred battle until we purify all the Syrian territories of terrorists and any foreign presence."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advising to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the topic of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "seeding irrational fears" that made them decide to stay out of the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats from the United Nations say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a de-escalation zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where 3 million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and has expressed the hope that the military action will focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), which will be "eliminated."
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy of the United Nations, is expected to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to draft a new constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers surely expect, an impeachment or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would be without a doubt "The most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million, respectively.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has surpassed the ratings of the cable news channels with 3.5 million viewers for the main news programs at night.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t understand,” Neal Baer, the show’s executive producer, tells us. “Designated Survivor” is a drama about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran writer of comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a ride in a taxi he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him that he would vote for Trump.
Why?
"Because it makes me laugh," was the response Scovell received.
Chaos is always at an all-time high in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families can reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged spectators.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", the hunter's coat of $15,000 of Paul Manafort ("a garment of excessive pride", in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of the scabrous descriptions of Stormy Daniels of the anatomy of Trump.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s in part what makes everything seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars” and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when we talk about the rotating cast of Trump and his daily plot twists (whether he’s fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to get left behind.
When I spoke with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside his house watching MSNBC and CNN at the same time.
I couldn't tear myself away from the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
"I remember when in those days we were doing all those crazy shows and people were telling us that this was the beginning of the end of western civilization," Fleiss tells me.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

Foreign money flows into the midterm elections of the most adjusted House of Representatives.
It is not a surprise that the influx of money is coming to the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the reorganization of a congressional district with two candidates who are seeking reelection to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburg, whose structure was recently redesigned, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another Republican candidate for reelection, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th Congressional District has sparked a battle for campaign funding between the main financial arms of the Democratic and Republican parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed down.
Diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection on the part of Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with the President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the owners of the hotel evicted the Trump Organization.
The Department of State decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, the development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As the meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials put off a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by the middle of September, high-ranking officials in the administration made it clear that their intention was that the conference go forward, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for the middle of October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a signal of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new threats or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the release of the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there is already a lot of evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also investigating the possibility that Trump's campaign was working in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will have to answer to that chamber, just when he is preparing to run again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and with that I don't mean that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the war.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of the story revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several of these points of inflexion.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good mood since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to serve in the office.
Rosenstein says that The Times's explanation is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation that the F.B.I. has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?"
In addition to all of this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these exams, we will find ourselves in a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we won't fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the group stage of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We got a good point out of it, because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing we could get something, and we ended up with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but, in general, the draw may have been a fair result.
We were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and we were the better team.
This Thursday we'll have another great night in Europe.
I hope we can get the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the previous game. But, with all the fans supporting us, I'm sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will turn out well.
The team is doing well, the boys are having a great time, and we are having a good training session.
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind us, and achieve success.
The fear of saving for retirement is keeping some women awake at night.
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their family members.
Around half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said that they did talk to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this topic.
“People want me to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and with your family to talk about where and how to receive care, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Include in the conversion to your financial advisor, since he can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
His options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help him cover his expenses or to insure himself with his own savings, as long as he has the money.
Negotiate his legal documents: get a head start on the legal battles.
Be sure to designate a person of trust to oversee your medical care and to make sure that the professionals carry out your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
He can also prepare a power of attorney for his finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father is having a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all of these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
"It's not just the finances that are at stake," Martin asks. "What doctors do you have to treat?"
What medications is she taking?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned out.
Several shots are fired at a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They have fired several times at a man with a rifle while he was walking home after leaving the house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was found in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, the abdomen and the hand.
The police officers described the shooting, which happened around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have made an appeal to possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said. It is expected that the number of deaths will increase.
Communications have been blocked, so the aid workers have not been able to get any information from the regency of Donggala, which is north of Palu and closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a sub-provincial administrative region hierarchically inferior to the province, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Donggala and Palu have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west coast of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of great seismic activity, and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Next, we summarize some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A great earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in the north of Sumatra, caused the 26th of December a tsunami that affected 14 countries and took the life of 226.000 people in the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims took place in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of victims were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with almost 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
In 2016, a shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 tsunami and earthquake.
This time it did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of earthquakes of great magnitude that caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
The son of Sarah Palin arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29 years old and a citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the police report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin has been ordered to be held in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held with a non-guaranteed bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked to make a statement, according to the channel.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a Class B misdemeanor, with a sentence of one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a criminal offense.
In December of 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the court of veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the reporting of a domestic violence crime, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he punched her in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking the violent behavior of her son to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead victims
At least 384 people died after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have fallen and it is expected that the death toll will increase in the next few days.
The earthquake took place just to the side of the centre of Sulawesi, which is located to the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived at the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in the New York City terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October 2017 attack on a bike path in the West Side of Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and bicyclists as he went.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury presented Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of a motor vehicle.
The attack required "a substantial amount of planning and premeditation," according to the prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notice of intent states.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
It has been more than a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York processed a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal execution in New York was that of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This couple was executed after they were convicted of conspiring to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said to the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked that the flag of ISIS be raised in his hospital room, according to the police.
He has been declared not guilty of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved,” said Patton.
The defense team for Saipov had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of UKIP said that politicians had to "feel the heat" of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK "would have left" if Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more when a group of Tories in favour of remaining in the EU have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers plan for Brexit on its feet in the face of attacks from Brexiteers, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and "chaos".
The Leave Means Leave MP John Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," she said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile."
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the protest, where she told reporters: "I'm just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people."
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it, and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.”
In a message directed to May, he added: "First ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the crowd that they would have to make the politicians "feel the heat" if they were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
Now it's a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the politicians who are about to betray the Brexit feel the heat."
"We are going to mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with the Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, those in favour of staying in the EU marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards reading "Tories Against Brexit" after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the problems they had with an app during the opening of the conference.
"These are the same people who are telling us that they can implement the systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of running for the presidency
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., says she will consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a town hall meeting held in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There has been a lot of speculation about the possibility of Warren facing off against Trump in 2020.
Saturday's event in Holyoke was Trump's 30th town hall meeting with voters using the municipal format since he took office.
An assistant asked him if he was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time that "women go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top."
An arrest has been made in the shooting death of LSU football player Tyrann Mathieu
The police of Baton Rouge (Louisiana) announced this Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the basketball player of the LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who is seen in the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the campus of the Southern University at first light on Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death," said the police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon, and to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1,98-metre-tall player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a key role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton out of the race by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Sebastian Vettel was the first to enter the pits and let Lewis Hamilton run in the back of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out a lap later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after an action with the wheels almost touching that made the Ferrari driver have to give up the inside line at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished in seventh place at the end of the first race.
He then led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered boxes in the 44th lap, but he could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to recover the fourth position.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman by letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect pair.
That's been a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia Occidental, the president did not mention directly the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, repulsive, and false."
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false," he said.
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say "But if I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his response... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, give me a minute.
Have we filtered it? No, we haven't filtered it,” he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and denied that the leak came from her office in early September.
“I didn’t hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I didn’t filter her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret and, therefore, I did."
But his refusal didn't seem to sit well with the president, who during his Saturday night speech said the following: "I'm going to tell you something: that was a really bad body language."
Maybe he didn't do it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own political gain.
They are determined to get their power back by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League by beating the Belfast Giants 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants took an early 2-0 lead thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local game before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
François Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third loss of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee by a score of 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won all three previous games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered an initial very animated period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to tie the game in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as the game drew to a close.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane in an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many more are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to batter the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, aged 21, refused to leave his post at the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained firm to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
He jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear this," the mother added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand people. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there are still many bodies under the rubble and we have not been able to contact a lot of people," says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Terrifying waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute comes an ambulance with more bodies."
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted in all places.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is trying to help as many people as possible, but we don't know what we will find there."
This already is in itself a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the army of the country: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
The CNN reported that they were ready.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes at the beginning of this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man has disappeared after the aircraft accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after saying that all 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening it has not been able to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had overshot the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane came very low.
Jaynes said, "That's a really good thing."
Jaynes comments that he and other passengers were able to make their way through water that was up to their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who were working on repairs to a pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the aviation safety network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents involving Papua New Guinea airlines registered in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution finished its arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The Department of Justice's Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He testified before the jury about how he used the phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the accused 29-year-old, and Jessica Chambers, the victim of 19 years, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting his previous statements, as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Chambers's phone had been with Sanford's phone during the time that Chambers said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls, and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be decided by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: "What is Conscious Hip Hop?"
A trio of hip hop artists want to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Interpreters like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A nanny in New York sues a couple for firing her after sending a racist text message.
A nanny in New York is going to sue a couple for discrimination after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denies that it is racist and compares it to a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her consternation when she discovered that the new baby sitter, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK WOMAN”, wrote the Sra. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead she was expecting a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for a day's work and sent it home in Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for a compensation of $350 a day for six months of work as an intern, although without a contract.
“I want to show them that things don’t happen like that,” he said to The Post on Friday and added that “I know this is a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable thing to do, as they feared that they could not trust her after having offended her.
“My wife had sent him something he didn’t want to say.”
She's not racist.
Joel Plasco, the husband, told the Post, "We are not racists."
But wouldn't you leave your children in the hands of someone who has been rude to you, even if it was an accident?
To your newborn?
“Come on!”
Comparing the demand as an "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a baby two months earlier and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going to go for someone like that?”
That's not a very decent thing to do,” added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and their logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, as revealed in a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who was reading the book for the first time before its publication."
It's very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a teddy bear to write a children's book, trusted that his work would be rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agridulce" after her father's death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very quiet man and didn't like to boast.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, even though it wasn't really your achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his own imagination, he always gave credit to his own Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
When the plane landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“She called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that she didn’t think she would make it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
After I received the call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes, I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said to him: "Tashi, I love you very much."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep his heart beating were slowly running out and his system was shutting down.
She had died before her time, and everything was going dark.
The only thing I could do was sit there and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep my composure.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was taking place.
She said, "Nobody knew."
I bent my head down and the tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all the love and understanding I could get.
He knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning put up cards to prevent suicides is a bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones to suicides are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call if they need help.
Tyler, the son of the Sra. Davis, began to suffer from depression when he was 13 years old and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any father to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
All of us knew him by his smile.
They always said that her smile could light up any place.
However, he left his job before he died, because he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after having taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm always worried about the consequences."
Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend."
Don't keep it to yourself, you have to talk about it.
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a friend of Davies's for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been living for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"He didn't say that he was depressed or anything like that," he tells us.
A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to get over it: "It leaves a void in the whole family."
It has left us devastated.
But all of us have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
“I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited investigation in time, with a limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going off the rails” in the middle of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican partisans not want the FBI investigation to take place?
His refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
Only five weeks remain until the midterm elections on November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
President George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary to the President.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear if Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of deserters from North Korea "fall" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by human traffickers, have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of deserters from the North are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed illegally into South Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants instead of refugees, and they are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have conversations that focused on the negotiations of nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, the foreign minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the lack of progress on U.S. sanctions.
“Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histrionic" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said that the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "histrionic" and that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin (Texas).
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have called her a hysteric," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used his emotions to deny the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking as he spoke of his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by some angry liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed his partiality against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with those statements and the way he's pursued the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi put her objections when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed in the case and if the Democrats got the majority in the House.
"I will only say one thing: if he is not telling the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he will not be fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court he is on now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible rulings of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, which is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a hysterical person and an impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine," Pelosi said.
And the women have to pick it up.
It's a justified diatribe, it's been months and years of fury overflowing, and she can't let it go without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," the Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's all that strange, do you?"
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to: "Maybe you think I'm crying because I'm sad."
No, I'm not angry."
And then he went on with what he was doing.
I thought it was great."
Crying is allowed as a way to let out anger in part because it's not really understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once when I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An older woman, a serious manager with whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he told me.
They have no idea that you're furious.
They think you are sad and they will be happy because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when they caught Hart in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business, she had to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea of running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," he said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and they didn't need another one.”
Someone referred to us as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was already very advanced, he stayed behind in the fundraising, so he promised that he would not enter the race again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he wondered.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on capturing voters instead of delegates, and anger at the sexism), that she choked.
"The logical thing would have been to think that she had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, remembering the reaction of the press.
You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to put on my gravestone?"
"Did he cry?"
The trade war between the U.S. and China could benefit Beijing.
The first salvos of the trade war between the U.S. and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rupture between the two countries could benefit Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning at the beginning of the year by imposing tariffs on the main Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs that affect 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds sterling) in products, which will add taxes to half of the products that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has taken retaliatory measures, applying tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has committed to equalizing the attacks of the U.S., and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world is going to back down soon.
It would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping to submit to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic crash in either of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than what the spectators have recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground is today more stable and safer thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is still trying to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to try to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of the refugees who had to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their means of living.
The U.N. estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
There are still six million people who live in the country and who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional help or the help of the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup of 2018 by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside of Paris (France).
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive matches on European soil since winning the last Ryder Cup on European soil in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn managed to get the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American golfer Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water on the par 3 16th hole, admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Francesco Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have ever achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The United States' Jordan Spieth lost to the European team's lowest-ranked player, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen, 5 and 4.
The number one player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European player with the most wins in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a very hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have been able to recover the cup.
It's a team effort and I'm very happy to have been able to help," said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now he passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in an individual match.
“I feel incredible pride to have beaten Tiger Woods, because I have grown up watching this man,” said the 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his career in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, leaving him only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they never gave up."
There was a moment this morning when we were able to warm up the situation in Europe.
But we messed it up.
I'd like to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it's our turn to bow our heads.
They've surpassed us."
Update of the red tide: Decrease in concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission) shows a general reduction in the concentrations of red tide in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, irregular flowering conditions are being reported in parts of the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which suggests a reduction in concentrations.
The bloom of the red tide extends approximately 130 miles along the Florida coast from Pinellas County to Lee County.
Irregular parcels can be found as far as 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places if compared to last week.
Red tide has also been detected in the county of Pasco.
During the past week, concentrations have been notified in the County of Pinellas and on its coast, concentrations between low and high in the County of Hillsborough, concentrations of low to high in the County of Manatee, concentrations of low to high in the County of Sarasota and its coast, concentrations of low to high in the County of Charlotte, concentrations of low to high in the County of Lee and on its coast, and concentrations of low to high in the County of Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come in from the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwestern part of Florida during the past week.
