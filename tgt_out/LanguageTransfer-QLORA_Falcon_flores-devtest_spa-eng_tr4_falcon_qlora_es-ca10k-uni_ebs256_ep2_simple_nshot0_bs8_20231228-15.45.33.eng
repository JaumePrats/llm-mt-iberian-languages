In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathery, a theory that is already generally accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this animal has a chestnut-colored plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotene-colored plumage on the lower part.
Moreover, the discovery allows us to understand better the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed axis, called the rachis, but they do have other feather characteristics, such as quills and barbules, the researchers came to the conclusion that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but to regulate temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers say that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, even though it is a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but most of the products coming from Central America were free of taxes.
Even so, the countries of Central America imposed tariffs of eighty percent on the products we manufacture. They treat us like that.
I thought that was unfair; definitely not fair.
All I say to people is that you treat us the way we treat you.
A law was proposed by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill proposes that violent video games sold in California must be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of the Crown Prosecution Service, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.

Schneider gave testimony through a virtual link from a base of the US Air Force in his country of origin.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races apart from the Wednesday competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he got a "Did not finish the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other career, the giant slalom, she got the tenth place in the female sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four slalom skiers of the category failed to complete their races and a total of 45 participants of 117 in the Giant Slalom did not reach the classification in the race.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the laptop and the mobile phone that were stolen.
The deputy inspector general, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the superintendent of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused presented themselves before the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.

In the beginning, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Court of the County of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is under custody awaiting the accusation and the trial, any witness's testimony can be questioned, since her image has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the processing of cases, said to the press that it would not make any further comments until the charge sheet was issued.
According to the information that has been leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine wants to resolve based on the existing borders prior to the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics that were also discussed, according to the information I have, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA only accepts five.
During the complementary pest control trial, the game wardens had to supervise the shooters closely, since this was monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the NSW Association of Target Shooters, volunteers were recruited to the Association's shooting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS, said that a comprehensive training and safety course was given to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it's the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the generalized protests that started in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, at times violent, were provoked by the fact that elections are not being held, in some cases since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, which caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry has spoken out about the delay in the Apple report, saying it was "truly lamentable".
Mariana was shaken by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake at 7:19 pm local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage on the Northern Mariana Islands.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, capital of the Philippines, a former police officer of that country kidnapped a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
They have rescued several hostages and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old lady because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time, while he was working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday the government investigators recovered the flight data recorders from the black box.
The wrestlers who fought alongside Luna also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Powder Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as me; even more so. I love her and I miss her. I hope she's in a better place."
Since 2008, when we surveyed 1400 people in advance of the 2010 federal elections, there was a 8% increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, the interim prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the Queen's reign was over.
34% of the respondents share this view and want Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At the other end of the survey, 29% of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other end, 31% think it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle had to swim in the freestyle style and three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned after his complaints.
He been unable to take painkillers to ease the pain, because it is forbidden to use them in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people checked the discovery by using different hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of scientists is to understand how planets are formed, particularly our own, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office at the beginning of the year and the month past, he signed a law that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He called it "political gossip and nonsense"
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
Use satellite technology, in contrast with the old radar technology, in order to allow the air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate data.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered the possibility of playing the game closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the Science magazine published an article about a new species of bird discovered in the Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University and Uppsala University in Sweden have revealed that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated to take much longer, because of the reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus-finch migrant, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
It is not only possible to hammer and roll into sheets, but also to stretch it until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it can be used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "manuscripts illuminated".
This is called pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using cranberry juice.
The colour of the juice of the cabbage will be altered depending on how acid or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of removing a proton from an electron.
Mix both dry powders together and, after mixing them, with clean and wet hands, knead them to form a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers of your skin, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had inodorous toilets with drainage in almost all houses, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, there were traces of sewer systems.
They also had public toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and the view that we have.
You need a giant rocket, more than 100 feet tall, to carry a satellite or telescope to space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to make travel much easier and faster.
Thanks to her we have many means of transport, like the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including domestic cats) that feed on small species that are much more abundant, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of his success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which avoids it from competing with others.
Lions are the big cats that socialize the most and their life takes place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their calves.
Usually, females are very close to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behaviour as wolf packs or dogs, with whom they share a surprising similarity (in contrast to other large cats) in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, dive, jump and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-bodied roar like that of the lion, but rather, like a sentence of words spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. In the best of cases, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will be smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (food) by smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places, and they move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey mimicking their surroundings and then they attack them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main population (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they can't easily go back), they will find themselves in a different environment than they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
No have been any changes in the original population, which still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As time goes by, as the population is adapting to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will not be possible to classify them as belonging to the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and it is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
Plant food is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. The majority of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except other Mosasaurs.
Their long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth like knives, and another group of teeth in the palate, which means that anything that came in front of them, had no escape.
We don't have the security, but it could have been a viper. Its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs and even a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a T. Rex, as big as it was, was a threat to him.
While most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, lobsters and even a type of rodent, the lizard.
Another thing that distinguished them was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the rich enjoyed sharing banquets and eating sideways.
It is impossible that the recipes of the ancient Rome included foods that arrived to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
In other words, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate, or Roman food. No Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy their needs by celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
In other cases, they built special towers with a pyramid shape, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the patio; the shops were just showcases that gave onto the street. The houses were built with stone.
In Canaan there were no big forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Few people lived in Greenland. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that he took more westward, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to his discovery, the Eskimos already inhabited the place at that time.
While each country was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may think that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. The reverse of the document contains something written, but it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has the following text on its reverse: "Declaration of Independence, original of July 4, 1776". The text is on the lower part of the document, facing down.
Although it is not known exactly who wrote it, it is known that it was written shortly after the event, and that it was rolled up and stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
While the D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, the south was still to be liberated.
His government was in the hands of the French Vichy, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragon was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of a group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and relates to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, as well as civitas, which means city or city state, and which, in addition, determines the size of the society.
The cities-states are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization with a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy, and a homogenous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and they are not recognized as civilisations in their own right.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was the only component.
The Congress did not have the power to set taxes, and since it had a national executive or judicial power, the function fell to the states, which often did not cooperate to enforce all their laws.
He was not qualified to annul fiscal laws or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval from all the states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave the government so little importance that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions of Spain, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan there are about 7000 islands (the largest one is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, it is often referred to as "Japan" as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who were sailing in the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the establishment of the Dutch East India Company in Taiwan, initiated a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty army (1644-1912) took control of the coastal region of northern Taiwan in 1683 and declared it as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex in order to show tourists how they looked originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and the work continues today.
To illustrate, the most common format for fixed-image photography at the global level is 35 mm, which was the most commonly used film size towards the end of the era of analogue film.
Today, it is still produced, but the most important thing is that the relationship between the dimensions is transferred to the sensors of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35mm format is a bit confusing, as its measurements are 36mm wide by 24mm high.
This is why it is said that the dimensional relation of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest ratio of integers) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS group) are similar or look very much like this relation of appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the object of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple rule that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing us to give some order to the images.
This indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had united the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected all, from the king to the people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be used for that specific purpose.
The central cupola of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognized international legal principle and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain has been extracting water from international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral ships at risk.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would find a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid that situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at Edison in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poems and a recommendation letter written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
This happens with the military, because now they base the charges of the army on the level of the soldier, instead of basing it on the class.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other people of the working class who were repressed in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this life. He used to visit a cave called "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured through the ages, illustrates in a very real way the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
On the top of one of the mountains north of La Meca, and in the middle of nowhere, lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains around. From the inside of this cave, you can see and hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramids of the same shape and size built to worship the deceased pharaoh.
The Guiza Plateau, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids, tombs and temples of a smaller scale were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The "upward arrow" mark is similar to a V and the "downward arrow" mark is similar to a grap or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, while a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the bow have been made in that place for a musical purpose, and therefore should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Luis Carlos, 4 years old), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a guard executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people paid the war expenses of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
Already, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in Europe in which these events take place is known as the Middle Ages, between the 11th and 13th centuries (that is, between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The technological determinism is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the impulse or imperative technological to a strict sense of that there is a logic underlying that drives the destiny of humanity and that is related to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on its own independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a reduced number of cars, so new techniques of manufacturing are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The determinism of culture was very present in romanticism, according to studies by Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography moulded people and, with the passing of time, customs and cultures developed that were related to that geography, which, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered as such in the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began approximately 400 BC and extended until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its status declined, especially due to the fact that, upon their return, the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the way of dressing received a great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the western styles could take a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe started to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
The term "subsistence farming" is used to describe a farming system that aims to produce enough food to feed only the farmer and his family.
The subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of seeds stored in the region with the rotation of crops and other simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many countries in the path of development.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality due to social standards and gives them the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to this by using distinctive and symbolic style, such as fashion, gestures and slang.
One of the most common mechanisms for graphically representing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, bad luck or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children have suffered traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or fleeing.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived by themselves in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical capabilities) almost identical to those of the animal that raised it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Although the project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new software or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in real or virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also a small animated paperclip in Microsoft Office is a type of scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand by himself.
Children are taken into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care or education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family system provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our foster care system is to provide safe, loving homes, nurturing foster parents, sustained education, and reliable medical care.
The objective of the foster care is to cover all the needs that were not attended in the home of the child before the foster care.
The Internet is a mixture of components of mass communication and between people.
The different traits that the Internet presents open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of users to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), the authors also detected "personal participation" and "durable relationships" as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that, by reading the microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of the speaker with precision.
It also suggests that the skills for interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
The segregation and recombination of genes shuffle the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the resources of plants that it has available.
Not doing it causes serious problems: slowing down of growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been the simplest source of vegetable resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except if they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not surprise us if our ancestors had solved their "protein problems" in the same way as chimpanzees do today.
Interrupting sleep consists of waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a clock alarm that will wake you up without waking you up completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm are drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is related to the amount of tension that is in their body and their spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we are in contact. Each one of us has the potential to find peace and absolute happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that blocks the way is our tension and negativity.
Although the basis of Tibetan Buddhism is the teachings of Buddha, they spread through the path of love Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, laism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be cleared, the chakras can be activated and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up by distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that on September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize itself in the extension of the Romanian head of bridge.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, bilateral and multilateral agreements, and international treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to guarantee that its country can move its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The Atlantic campaign in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the purpose of obtaining easily their milk, meat, skin and hair, the ancient peoples and tribes started to keep them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in herds that wandered the hills or other areas of grazing, often tended by herdsmen who were children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd. These methods of grazing are still used today.
In England, the railways had been installed in the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses to pull them to go faster and carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place was done quite early. However, gradually, they realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused a greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767, they started using iron wheels.
The first form of transport was walking. The human being began to do it in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
The Australopithecus ancestors did not walk upright.
While bipedal tracks have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start to live a more friendly life with the planet, join environmentalist movements or even become activists and fight to reduce, in some measure, the suffering of the future.
Yes, in many cases, like the asintomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, due to the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, in Philadelphia, a few blocks away.
Copies were made, during the night, between 150 and 200, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time and did it in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8th.
On July 6th, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on July 9th. On August 10th, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are birds.
Many people don't represent them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work with data coded in binary.
A binary number can only have two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are called binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is finding an open bottle of medicine or cleaning chemicals.
Read the label to get information about specific first aid for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasitic insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with the lice, a very developed species to parasitize humans.
Bedbugs and bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States has risen to about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among adults aged 20 to 50.
The central nervous system, the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack of multiple sclerosis.
The studies showed that women have twice the chances of men to suffer from EM.
A couple could conclude that raising a child would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific research.
This is not an experiment, but a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing phenomena that guide the scientific research.
The focus of naturalists and philosophers was placed on the classical works; especially, the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those of science, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, Western civilization distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining way and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA was a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fungus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected fragment of genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have different effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes the animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transfer launcher, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists support that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
All of us are part of society and use the transport systems; and almost all of us complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
What is the reason for the complaints of such a nature and why do they happen daily? Are the engineers of transport simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, because it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of the drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and to be represented by an approximate mathematical model.
In order to graphically represent the flow of circulation more clearly, three important relations were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations facilitate the planning and design of the road network and the operations of the road network devices.
The first insects to fly were the insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, pressing them against their bodies.
This provides a wider range of possible hiding places for small animals from predators.
At present, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Millennia ago, a man called Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon River is the most caudalous and the second most extensive river in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water that comes from the rivers of the world that flows into the oceans, 20% comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the pyramids of Guiza, nor in size nor in the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest in population.
Italian is used in the Vatican City, both for drafting its legislation and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that most people speak daily is Italian, and Latin is used only for religious ceremonies.
All the citizens who live in the Vatican City are Catholics.
The basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It had a greater resemblance to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but at the same time it had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be the elements like calcium and potassium. From the beginning, there are metals like gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
For this reason, when it was invented, the pencil gained many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to approach a pencil.
The only thing left to ask is what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill. When you divide the nucleus once more, you release some of that energy.
Some atoms' nuclei are unstable, that is, they tend to decompose with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer shell is called the crust.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km on the side close to the observer and about 100 km on the side far from the observer.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more lakes on the side closer to the volcano because the crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to reach the surface.
The content theories are focused on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines say that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grow up until they reach maturity.
These theories analyze what causes some people to want certain things and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
The managers of this category have a hard time making decisions that are unpopular with their employees, imposing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and demanding accountability from their employees.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it necessary to change everything that has been done until now by the group and do it in its own way.
In the end, the ultimate success or failure of the team is the leader.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team act as a point of contact for their physical team.
Generally, they enjoy more autonomy than the members of a traditional group, thanks to the possibility of their teams meeting at different times, which, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a "real invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of managing and to which each member reports. It fixes the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organization to submit to the process of establishing an organization for learning? One of the purposes of applying the concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the available resources are used in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
The result of this, is that the organization that works in a team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process to attend the needs of the customers.
For an organization to be innovative, the leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offers factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. It reduces the field of research and gives it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time, it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before in the brain.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
While there is a lot of association between artificial intelligence and science fiction, it is a speciality of great relevance within computer science, which is responsible for the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI implies the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and consultation requests from customers, as well as facial recognition, handwriting recognition, and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence system is used now often in the economy, medicine, engineering and military, in the same way as it was incorporated in various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as an album of memories.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with a grammar and spelling that is not very careful, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Because students are the readers who most criticize, the blogger starts to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid the criticism.
Blogging also requires that students be more understanding of the world around them. The need to engage the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and it has a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting Muskoka and the extension that follows.
These aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The northernmost areas are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
For a comparison of the population that causes great surprise to many: in the United States there are more African Americans than Canadians.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest island in the world, if we talk about wild life.
The majority of the smallest islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and it was imposed, in large part, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The first European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, as a result of the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, of the route that links the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region borders with the Sahel to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is advised that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round to reject men and not to fear to defend your position (there are cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of White House, but in 1755 they abandoned it after the earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco with the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in Morocco.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist point in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the eastern border, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left a large part of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any trip outside the city should be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the North Kivu province.
The city is the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking excursions are the most economical in Africa.
To get to Goma, you can take a moto-taxi. The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
And, added to the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, it has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and distant image.
Tombuctú is a poor city today, but it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included in the World Heritage List, due to the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del Mundo Africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecosystems, in each of which a different wild life lives.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all the natural reserves of South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows you to enter the parks of South Africa or all the National Parks of the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island of Hong Kong, which is the destination of most tourists consider the main attraction.
The comparison of the buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong with a luminous bar chart that shows the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and go to the Kowloon side, located in front.
The reclaimed land in the northern coast of Hong Kong is where the city's urban development is most dense.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see proof of the past colonial history of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Although this is not without risk, the forests are not only mangroves, but also contain some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swamp.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wild life and it is estimated that there are 400 tigers in the area and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those that travel to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket with some days of advance.
Almost all districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cantilever bridge that crosses the river, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that currently constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá aboriginal groups lived in the region of Chaco, and they hunted, fished and gathered as a way of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spanish started the colonization stage, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to conserve a good part of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and players in the world.
The most important polo tournament of the year takes place in December in the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also see other tournaments and matches in other parts of the year.
On the website of the Argentine Association of Polo you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in relation to the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. It is in front of the FIC West store, in Stanley.
Sterling is accepted in most places in the islands. In Stanley, you can pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There are chances that in the outer islands they do not accept credit cards, but they might accept British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to know which payment method is accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money in the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do it before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and viceversa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above 30°C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: although it is very rare that temperatures fall below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same all year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild life is still wild, so you shouldn't feed it or disturb it.
According to the instructions of the park authorities, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals.
Even if they are as gentle as they may appear, the truth is that bears, bison, elk, moose and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors suffer injuries each year because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous; so respect their space.
Also, remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so you should avoid cooking food that releases a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except for a British cruiser. They killed nearly two hundred Americans and Germans.
During the war for independence that the Mau movement faced, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the state's leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland has two ports. The most famous ones are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, in the Pacific Ocean, there are beaches from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
Most beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive unfold in the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the local beer most popular and it is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
Although there is a great variety of French wines, the New Zealand and Australian wines could be considered better for transport.
The local water from the tap is completely safe for consumption, but if you are worried, you can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the notion of "black coffee" as foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and there, the wounds caused by any of these causes are rare.
In any case, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all the signals and pay special attention to the security alerts.
The Portuguese man-of-war is found near the beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April, north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where the saltwater crocodiles live. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
The advance booking of accommodation gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to stay when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined packages of flights and accommodation.

We have to take into account that, while the musical actions may have ended, in other parts of the festival they may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special areas for camping, intended for families with children.

The stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging stretch of road and frequently passes through remote and isolated areas.
If you don't usually drive on rural roads, keep your eyes open: there are many steep slopes, narrow roads and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are notoriously lower than on the previous stretches and on the ones that follow, usually between 56 and 64 miles per hour (90 and 103 kilometers per hour), and their strict enforcement is even more important than on any other stretch.
However, curiously, the signal of the cell phones is much better here than in many other sections of the road like Pennsylvania Wilds.

The stirrups are the supports for the feet of the riders who hang on both sides of the saddle.
While providing greater stability to the rider, they can present problems of safety, as it is possible that the rider's feet get tangled in them.
If a jockey is thrown from a horse, but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, there are a series of safety measures.
First of all, most of the riders use boots with a narrow heel and a flat sole.
In addition, there are saddles, especially English saddles, with safety bars that allow the leather of the saddle to be detached from its structure if a rider who falls off pulls back.
The Cochamo Valley is the most popular climbing destination in Chile and is known as the "Yosemite of South America" for its extensive walls and granite cliffs.

Imagine the ski slope as a hiking trail.
Under satisfactory conditions, it will be able to cover distances a little longer than if it were walking, but very rarely will it reach the speed of skiing on a prepared slope without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to apply for visas and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area works as a single country in this sense.
Generally, when you move within this region, you can cross the border without passing through a passport control post.
In the same way, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa for each country in the Schengen area. This will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects older than 100 years are antiques.

As soon as I escape the current, swimming back will not be more difficult than usual.

If you sent a shipment by air freight, in some routes it may have taken days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to make it faster was to send it as checked baggage. The airlines' regulations prohibit transporting baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or executive class on an airplane is to spend a fortune on that privilege (or, what is better, have your company pay for you).
But this has a price: in general terms, you can pay up to four times the economic tariff in business class and up to eleven in first class.
Generally speaking, it's a waste of time to look for discounts for first class or business class seats on direct flights.
