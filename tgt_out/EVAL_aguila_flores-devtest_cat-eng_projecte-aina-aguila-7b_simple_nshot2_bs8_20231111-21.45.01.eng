Martelly took the oath of office to a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) of nine members.
It is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
The commission recommended the resignation of the previous Electoral Provisional Council, in the context of a package of measures aimed at advancing the country toward new elections.
The commission was the response of Martelly to the general protests against the regime that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of holding elections, some of which had been scheduled for 2011.

Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% from 2008.
La primera ministra interina Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
The 34% of respondents want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the edges of the poll, 29 per cent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 per cent believe that Australia should never become a republic.

A study published Thursday in Science described the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Scientists from Princeton University in the U.S. and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in only two generations, even though it was thought that such a process would take a lot of time.
It can be worked in all sorts of shapes. It can be molded into all sorts of shapes.
It can be woven into threads, which can be twisted. It can be compressed into sheets, which can be folded.
It can be made very fine and layered over other metals. It can be so fine and layered over other metals.
This is the pH of a substance. You can make a pH indicator by using a sample of col lombarda juice.
Carrot juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the substance.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions in the substance being analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which the electrons have been removed.
Mix the two dusty powders and then, with clean hands, make a ball.
Humidity in the hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Discovered remains of sewage in houses of the Minoan civilisation in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also public baths in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China.
When you call somebody who is miles away from you, you're using a satellite.
The satellite picks up the signal and then reflects it back to the ground.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. The scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and our view.
We need a rocket bigger than 100 feet high to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in a remarkable way. The most remarkable thing that the wheel has done for us is to make transportation very quick and easy.
He brought us the train, the car and many other kinds of transport.
Below them there are more medium-sized cats that eat smaller-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and antelopes.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including the domestic cat) that eat the small prey that is far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, birds, and small mammals.
The secret of his success is the concept of a niche, a special skill that each cat has and that prevents him from competing with the other cats.
Lions are social animals and live in large groups called bands.
Groups are made up of one to three males, with up to thirty females and their cubs.
Sisters and daughters are intimately related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions tend to behave in much the same way as wolves or packs of wolves, which are animals with a remarkably similar behaviour to that of the lions.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb, swim, jump great distances and push with 5 times the strength of a human strongman.
The tiger is in the same family (tribe) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only cats that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is like the roar of the lion, but not as loud as the roar of a lion.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt mice, snakes, birds and small birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find the animals that are eating (prey) with their sense of smell.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can move very quietly. They catch their prey by ambushing them from behind.
When a small group of organisms (a population) is separated from the main group and original (for example, crossing a mountain or a river, or emigrating to a new island and not being able to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment from the one they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need to have different characteristics or adaptations from those it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same kind of adaptations that they had before.
With time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new surroundings, it begins to look more like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
The process of speciation is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants manufacture oxygen, which humans breathe, and take up carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants manufacture their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also shade other plants.
We build our houses with plants and we make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat is plants. Without plants, most animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, reason for which it had no fear of anything except other mosasaures.
His long jaws had seventy-six sharp teeth like knives, with an additional set in the sky of the mouth, so that there was no escape for anything that came between him and his prey.
No we know for sure, but it may have been a bifurcated language. His diet may have included turtles, fishes long, other mosasaures, and perhaps even a cannibal.
He attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant T. rex couldn't match him.
The Romans ate a few unusual foods, such as wild boar, pheasants, rats, and lemmings.
Another difference was that, while the poor and women ate in chairs, the rich liked to participate in banquets where they all sat together while they ate.
The ancient Roman meals would not have included foods that have come to Europe from America or Asia in more recent centuries.
They had no maize, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no peas, and no chicken.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to cover the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a courtyard and then a closed sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramids were built in the shape of a tower, called ziggurats, as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the home wasn't as important.
The majority of the family life of the Jewish people was spent in the open air.
The women cooked in the kitchen; the shops were simple open stalls that looked out onto the street. They used stone to build houses.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorisation and lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland because of a murder and, on his journey westward, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorisation and lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor.
Although all of them were Scandinavian countries, there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may have imagined that behind the Declaration of Independence is a map of the treasure.
There is no such thing as a map of the treasure.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Declaration of Independence original with date 4 July 1776". The text is found at the bottom of the document, down.
Although no one knows with certainty who wrote it, it is known that the long scroll (29¾ polzades per 24½ polzades) was folded to store it.
It seems that the notation was added simply as an attachment.
The landings on D-Day and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south of France still wasn't free.
It was governed by the Vichy France.
Operation Dragoon
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilisation is a culture shared by a group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city-state.
A city-state precedes a nation. A civilised culture involves the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a lasting cultural legacy, and a fair and equitable sharing of knowledge.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving archaeological traces and are not recognised as civilisations properly so.
During the War of Independence, the Thirteen Colonies formed a weak central governmentbeing the only component of the Congressunder the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no executive or judicial national power, it fell on the state officials to enforce its acts.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorisation and lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor.
The Articles needed the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended and the states often absenteeed.
The Italian national football team, with the national football team of Germany, is the second most successful national team in the world and they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swimming, ice hockey, cycling, motor racing, auto racing, and Formula One.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and count with the presence of Italians who participate in international and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins stretch back to the 15th century, when Portuguese sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-east of Taiwan, where they initiated the transformation of indigenous agricultural practices and recruited Chinese workers for the plantations of rice and sugar.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) takes control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan in 1683, and declares Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
The treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, was signed in 1895.
Machu Picchu consists of three buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give visitors a better idea of how the buildings looked originally.
Machu Picchu has been restored to its former glory.
For example, the most common film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the size of the main film format at the end of the analog era.
It is still today, but still more important: his relation of aspect has been inherited in the formats of digital camera sensors.
The 35mm format creates a little bit of confusion, with 36mm of width and 24mm of height.
It is said that the relation of aspect of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of numbers) is, therefore, of 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats, for example) are very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been too used and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time maintains order in an image.
He says that the most effective place for the subject principal is in the intersection between the lines that divide the image into three vertical and horizontal sections (see the example).
During this period the history of Europe was put into question, the Roman Catholic Church became rich and powerful.
Christianity has united Europe for more than a thousand years, despite the differences in language and customs.
His power was omnipresent, affecting kings and commoners alike.
One of the principal principles of Christianity is that the rich should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds exist precisely for this reason.
The authority of the church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led to many people asking if it was being fulfilled.
Soon after the start of the war, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective, cutting off the vital supplies of military and civilian personnel, but this blockade violated international law generally accepted that had been codified by several international agreements in the last two centuries.
The British mined the international waters to prevent any ships from entering segments complete of ocean, putting even neutral ships in danger.
Because there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany was expected to respond with a submarine war without restrictions.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, the nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company of New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
The Ancient China had a unique way of showing time periods differently: each era of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
In these periods wars were fought ferociously between many of the nobles who fought for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most bloody periods in Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the seat of power at the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, the occupations were opened to all men who applied.
This s'aplica també als militars, perquè en lloc de basar els estaments de l'exèrcit en classes, a partir d'aquest moment es van basar en la rellevància.
The French Revolution inspired many other working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mahoma was interested deeply in matters beyond this life. He used to frequent a cave that was known with the name of "Hira" on the Mount of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, gives a clear picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the summit of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
De fet, i fins i tot coneixent-ne l'existència, no és gens fàcil de trobar. L'aïllament és absolut un cop arribes dins de la cova.
There is not much of this world that can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Constructed by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramids built to honour the Egyptian Farao.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (among which, the Great Pyramid is the largest), several tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honour of the Pharaoh Kheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and temples were erected in honour of the wives and members of the family of the Pharaoh.
The sign "upwards arrow" resembles the letter V (ve baixa) and the sign "downwards arrow" resembles a grape or a square without the lower side.
When the arrow points up it means that you have to start from the tip of the arrow and push it upwards, and when the arrow points down it means that you have to start from the bottom of the arrow and push it downwards.
Sweeping the strings from right to left produces a softer sound, while sweeping the strings from left to right produces a more assertive sound.
Take the freedom to annotate your own instructions, but be aware that the arrow marks are for a musical reason, so you should respect them.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two youngest children (Maria Teresa of 11 years and Louis-Charles of four years) and the sister of the King, Madame Elisabeth, were compelled by a mob of women traders to return from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
In a certain point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a royal guard murdered in Versailles in front of the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of the imperialism of the United States during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the people of the Philippines.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the colonial American regime, in order to cover the expenses and interest of the floated bonds in the name of the government of the Philippines through the Wall Street banks.
For certain, the great gains derived from the exploitation of the Philippines people would be the basic gains of imperialism in the United States.
To understand the Knights Templar it is necessary to understand the circumstances that led to their creation.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 10th to the 13th centuries (1.000 - 1.300 dC).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which lasted until about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas, from the impetus of technology or the imperative of technology to a narrower sense that human fate is guided by a hidden logic that is associated with the laws of science and its manifestation in technology.
The majority of interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology in itself follows a course independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, motor vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a network of roads for just a handful of cars is not economically feasible, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of having a car.
The possession of cars in large numbers also leads to a greater number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair bodies damaged by accidents.
Romanticism had a strong component of cultural determinism, drawn by writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography gave shape to people, and with time cultural customs and cultures became better than laws imposed arbitrarily, as they were in harmony with the place and with the society.
As Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered to be the capital of fashion in the European feudal world.
His fame as a centre of luxury began in the 400s and lasted until the 11th century.
His status waned during the twelfth century because the Crusaders had returned with gifts like silks and spices that were more valuable than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was in this moment that the title of capital of the fashion industry went from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak of popularity in the 13th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the culture of the Byzantine Empire to the east.
However, and owing to the slow communication channels, styles could often arrive in the west with 25 to 30 years delay.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time is that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
 subsistence farming is the farming of subsistence.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, organic system that uses native seeds of the ecoregion combined with rotation of crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and still is in many developing nations.
Subcultures attract individuals who feel abandoned by mainstream society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Cultural qualities that determine a subculture as differentiated can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of the factors.
The members of a subculture often distinguish themselves from those of other subcultures by the use of a distinctive style, which includes modes, customs and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while they were growing up, due to neglect, misfortune or malicious intent.
These children are called "savages" or feral. Some children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this abandonment was due to the severe intellectual or physical disability of the child by part of the parents.
Children of the Wild may have suffered abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Other supposedly have been raised by animals; of some is said to have lived in the wild all alone.
The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, presents behaviours (always within some physical limits) almost identical to those of the animal that raises him, such as fear or indifference in relation to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffold is a step further.
The theory of bastides is not a method of learning, but a tool that helps individuals who undergo a new experience of training, such as learning to use a new computer program or embarking on a new project.
Virtual bastides can be real or virtual: said in other words, a teacher is a bastida, but also is the small clip assistant of Microsoft Office.
Virtual bastides are internalised in the software and are designed to question, show and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to solve on his own.
Children are given in adoption for different reasons that range from abandonment to abuse, from extortion to exploitation.
Children should not grow up in an environment where they are not fed, loved, nurtured and educated, but there are some who do.
We believe that foster care is a form of safety for these children.
Our welcoming system must provide safe homes, caring carers, healthy education and reliable healthcare.
Supposed to provide all the needs that were not fulfilled in the home from which they were taken.
Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and reward.
For example, learning and socialisation are suggested as important reasons for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Implicit personal and "relations in course" were identified as new motivators for Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the reaction of the public to web sites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorisation and lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand the speech due to damage to the brain but are still able to evaluate the sincerity of the speech very precisely.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorisation and lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor.
In the twentieth century, research has shown that there are two kinds of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection eliminates it from the pool of variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine forward and backward variation between the two gene pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its needs of amino acids with the resources available in the plants.
It also has serious consequences: deterioration of growth, malnutrition, and finally death.
The plant resources that were most readily available would have been the proteins that are found in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like ourselves.
In contrast, plant-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are difficult to digest, but they contain a great amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised by the fact that our ancestors were able to solve their "protein problem" as chimpanzees of the savanna do today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of awakening during the normal period of sleep and returning to sleep again at a later time (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do by using a quiet alarm clock that makes you awake but does not wake you completely.
If you are of those who rewind the clock while sleeping, try to put it on the other end of the room, so that you have to turn it on to wake up.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking plenty of liquids (especially water or tea) before going to bed, so that one is obliged to get up to urinate.
The amount of peace interior that a person possesses is inversely proportionate to the amount of tension in body and spirit.
As low as possible is the tension, the more positive is the vital force present. Everyone has the potential to find peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. The only thing standing in our way is our own negativity and tension.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was spread by the path of love of Mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of the kundaliní yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Yoga Kundalini awakens the kundalini energy (il·lustrada) through postures of yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, mantras and visualisations.
The meditation centre is the yoga of the goddess.
Germany was the common enemy in the Second World War, which facilitated co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union. With the armistice came the clash of systems, processes, and cultures, and both countries hated each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for forty years and was fought from Africa to Asia, in fields of battle in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
Polish defences had already been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and re-organise on the Romanian side of the Dniester.
However, these plans became obsolete during the night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Polish–Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, other international treaties, bilateral treaties or multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is, with a great deal, the most efficient method of transporting people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the marines traditionally has been to ensure that your country maintains the capacity to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the capacity of your enemy to move people and goods.
One of the most prominent recent examples was the North Atlantic Ferry Service campaign during World War II.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorisation and lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to conquer Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that sheep were domesticated for the first time in the Zagros Mountains, Iran, about 10,000 years ago.
Cultures and tribes of ancient peoples began to domesticate them to obtain milk, meat, skins, and fur.
Domestic sheep and goats were kept in flocks that grazed on hills or other areas of pasture, often watched by children or teenagers. These methods of grazing are still used today.
The carriages were built in England in the sixteenth century.
Though the rails consisted only of planks of wood, they pulled trains along with horses to achieve faster speeds and lift heavier loads in the most difficult sections.
Trains were introduced early to keep the rails in their place. However, soon it was seen that the rails would be more effective if they had a covering of iron over them.
This became a common practice, but the wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carriages became more pronounced.
The first iron rails were laid down in 1767.
The first known form of transportation was walking, humans first started walking about two million years ago with the emergence of the Homo erectus.
His ancestors, the australopitecs, did not walk upright.
Specializations in bipedalism have been found in fossils of australopithecines from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but australopithecines could have walked on two legs at most 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more respectfully with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become environmental activists.
It works only as a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and then deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot because of the advancement of science and technology, and that the problems have grown because of the excessive population and the extravagant lifestyles of humans.
After his adoption by the House of Representatives on July 4, a written draft, signed by the president of the House, John Hancock, and the secretary of the House, Charles Thompson, was sent to the printer John Dunlap to be printed.
Dunlap's flyers were printed during the night.
The first public reading of the Declaration of Independence took place in Independence Hall on July 8, 1776.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy was sent to London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap brochures that still exist are the only surviving copies of the original manuscript.
Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and that they are still alive today.
Many people don't realize them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many traits of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have scales with sharp spines and claws, and they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus rex.
The vast majority of computers that we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can only have two possible values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these values are known as binary digits or bits, according to the computer jargon.
Intoxicació interna may not be apparent immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of a medicine container or household chemicals poisoning.
Search for instructions on specific first aid treatment for the specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient parasitic relationship with xinxes, which are highly adapted to parasitising humans.
Nuthatches and chickadees are nest-dwellers, adapted to seeing in the nest or shelter of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the most common neurological disorder in young and adult middle-aged people.
Neurology is a disease that affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research has concluded that women have twice as many (2 times more) chances of suffering from multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple can decide that raising a child is not the best for their own interests or the interests of their child.
These couples can choose to adopt a baby.
A child adoption, parents of birth lose their parental rights over the child.
The aim of science is to discover how the world works through the use of the scientific method.
Experimentation is not the only, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classics and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
He accepted the opinions of Aristotle on all matters of science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the Orient became disconnected from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many rhythms that are observed in physiology and behaviour often depend on the presence of endogenous rhythms and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks are self-oscillating oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fags, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made two experiments marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfuric acid.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the cells affected are cells of the germinal line.
Only germline mutations in cells of the germinal line can be passed on to the offspring, but mutations at any other site can cause cell death or cancer.
The tourism based on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the natural environment, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, birdwatching, photography, and visits to parks and study of information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Each morning, people in small rural towns get in their cars and drive to their jobs.
In this dynamic vehicle everyone, of some way, is connected with, and supports, a system of public transportation based on private cars.
The science shows today that this massive economy of coal has unsettled one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of man for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses public transportation.
In developed countries you rarely hear complaints about the quality of drinking water or the collapse of bridges.
Why public transport systems generate such complaints, why fail daily? Is it because the engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow Study is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict the driver's behaviour with 100% certainty.
Traffic flow tends to be relatively constant; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to be approximately constant and can be represented mathematically.
To represent better the flow of traffic, relationships have been made between the three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help planning, design, and operations of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly enabled them to flee from enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings around their bodies.
It gives them a great variety of hiding places where they can escape from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings are the efímera and the dragonfly.
A man named Aristoteles once said that the solar system moves around the sun.
There were people who thought that what he said was true, but a lot of people thought the opposite; that the Solar System was moving away from the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because we don't have the sense that the Earth is moving, or is it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and the largest river in the world by volume.
Amazon River is the widest river in the world.
The 20 per cent of the water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is the longest river in the world.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the pyramids of Gizah was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which then had a thousand years or more.
The population of the Vatican City State is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and in its official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by the majority of people who live in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since antiquity, as they can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
He looked more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, though according to his theory, they also changed to become new substances that we see.
The alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
Alloys may also contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
All matter is composed of matter.
The atoms are so incredibly small that bilions of atoms would fit inside the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend of many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new methods of writing, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status and a lesser role.
Today, people write messages on computer screens, without ever needing a pencil.
Only we can ask ourselves how the keyboard will become when something else comes along.
The fission bomb works by the principle that energy must be applied to unite a large number of protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a steep hill. Separating the core from the wheels releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break up with a small collision or no collision at all.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust.
The bark measures 70 kilometres in the closest part and 100 kilometres in the farthest part.
It is thinner under the moon and thicker under mountainous terrain.
It may be that there are more moons on the visible face of the moon because the crust is thinner here.
Theories of content focus on finding what interests or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what makes people want what they do and what makes them do what they want to do.
Two famous theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs and Hertzberg's Factors of Happiness.
On the other end of the spectrum, leaders begin to lead their previous colleagues.
This type of principal has difficulty in taking decisions that are unpopular, imposing discipline, carrying out assessments, assigning responsibilities and making others responsible for their own acts.
In the opposite case, one is transformed into an individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that has been going on in the team and do it his own way.
After all, the leader is the ultimate responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to fights between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as their conventional counterparts, but with some small differences.
Members of a virtual group tend to function as a point of contact for their physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as their teams can gather in different time zones than the local management can comprehend.
The presence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique feature of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the invisible management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing an learning organization? One of the goals for putting in place an organization of learning is to innovate.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used effectively in functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, the joint work of an organization to overcome an adversity can lead to an innovative process to respond to the need of the customer.
Because an organization can be innovative, leadership needs to create an innovation culture as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuous improvement approach as a method employed by organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobehavioral data provided physical proof for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. As a result, it reduces the area of research and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain disorders and personality traits is supported by the work of scientists.
It is known that different types of brain damage, traumatisms, injuries and tumors affect the behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to construct models of simulation that help us understand the processes in our minds.
The field of artificial intelligence studies the behaviour, learning and adaptation of machines.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves making machines that behave intelligently.
Examples include control, planning, programming, capacity to answer customer questions and the recognition of writing, voice, and facial features.
These things have become disciplines separated that focus on solving real-life problems.
The system is now widely used in the economy, medicine, engineering, and military, as it has been built in several applications for home computers and video games.
School trips are a major part of any classroom.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in museums, visit a fish aquarium or admire the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual journey also is an excellent way to reflect on a journey and share the experiences with future students.
For example, each year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the website is updated, but the older versions are kept online as a book of records.
Blogs can help students improve their writing skills.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorisation and lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor.
The blogs encourage students to be more astute with the world around them.
Blogging encourages students to broaden their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The use of blogs can help students be more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of what they write about others and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics responding actively to internet materials (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and boasts a series of art galleries and museums that show the past and present of Canada.

The concept of skiing is very old - there are paintings of skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport is at least as old as skiing itself, but it was in the year 1861 that the first ski club in Australia was formed.
Ski touring: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, backcountry skiing, ski touring, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering, ski mountaineering,
Snowboarding generally does not involve alpine skiing or mountain skiing, which require stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route like a hiking route.
In good condition, you will be able to cover distances a bit longer than walking - although in few occasions will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in flat terrain.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. In normal circumstances, travelling between several countries would involve having to apply for visas and passport controls.
The Schengen zone, though, works as a single country in this regard.
While you are in this zone, generally you can cross borders without having to re-pass the immigration control.
De la mateixa forma, having a Schengen visa does not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen countries separately, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition for articles manufactured that are considered to be antique. Some tax authorities determine that articles manufactured over 100 years are antique.
The definition has differences geographically, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America in comparison to Europe.
Traditional crafts can be regarded as antiquaries, although they are more recent than other mass-produced items.

Extreme weather conditions are the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause significant damage, social disruption, or loss of life.
Weather conditions can be extreme anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather that can depend on the geography, topography, and weather conditions.
Storms, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and other severe weather are forms and effects of weather phenomena, such as storms, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and other severe weather.
Between the severe weather phenomena seasonal and regional, there are tornadoes, snowstorms, and sandstorms.
It is strongly advised that travellers be aware of weather conditions that could affect their journey.
Whoever intends to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should take a course in professional training.
A search on the internet for "hostile environment course" will likely lead to the address of a local business.
A course usually covers all the problems that have been dealt with here in a more detailed way, usually with practical experience.
A typical course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, first aid, and, sometimes, training in the use of weapons.
The books and magazines that talk about survival in the wilderness are frequent, but are few the publications that deal with war zones.
The travellers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery in another country should ensure they have the valid documents for the return journey.
