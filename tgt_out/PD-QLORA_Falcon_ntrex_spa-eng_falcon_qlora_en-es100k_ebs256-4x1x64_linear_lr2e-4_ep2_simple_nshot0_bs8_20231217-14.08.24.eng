Members of the Welsh Assembly (AMs) are concerned about appearing "Muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for short).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from all political spectrums are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
One Member of the Labour Party Assembly declared that his group was concerned that it would be "Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: twp means twat and pwp means shit.
One Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that his group was "disappointed" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the leap from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Assembly &apos; s Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change, states: &quot; Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of a Member of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves. &quot;
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed strong support for calling a Parliament for Wales.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the option MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly were apparently suggesting alternatives, but the fight for consensus could hold up the bill for Assembly President Elin Jones, who should be sending the bill for the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word in the question of how the legislation should be named when they debate it.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the country &apos; s name
The voters will decide on Sunday whether the name of their country will change to "Republic of Macedonia North".
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, has stated that he will ignore the vote.
However, the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin &apos; s bells are silent for the difficulties of Harlem churches
Historically, older people I have spoken to say that there was a pub and a church on every corner, Mr. Adams comments.
Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.
He noted that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People are socializing in other ways now,” he says.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods that people regularly visit.
With regard to churches, he was concerned that money obtained from the sale of property would not last as long as leaders expected and that &quot; sooner or later, they would come back to square one &quot;.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the type of people who would not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore they will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin &apos; s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped there acquired the building.
A black congregation took over St. Martin's, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while the congregation of Father Johnson made plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly called them "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who struck the gavel called it &quot; a cultural treasure &quot; and &quot; an irreplaceable historical instrument &quot;.
Furthermore, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first time that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, had played the Riverside Church carillon, which is larger, for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the parish governing body, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the parish board, although the board had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiger shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters off California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon &apos; s Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about an hour on Saturday morning when they heard the child calling for help, so they swam over to rescue him.
Hammel commented that at first he thought he was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then realized that he was screaming that he had been bitten.
Hammel noted that the boy &apos; s collarbone was broken when he arrived at the scene.
Hammel added, "I yelled at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark."
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children &apos; s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The medic, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had upper chest trauma.
The authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there were more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury &apos; s plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff working in their beauty and style departments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at £2.8 trillion and with growth increasing in comparison to the fall in fashion and home sales, the largest beauty halls will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, rolled out to more stores next year.
Beauty investment comes at the same time as this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges, with similar zones to other stores, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second of which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shops and the shift to daily small-quantity shopping in local shops are forcing supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will increasingly resemble shopping centres as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores since it acquired these chains two years ago. It is believed that this has driven food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion about how to split the income from the pharmacy counters in its supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of 281 Sainsbury's pharmaceutical outlets to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will be participating in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, commented: 'We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specialized expertise that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million deal
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones stormed off the set after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the fashion and accessory brand Truly.
This business had compared favourably with Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the business.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the girl of the television screen admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, did not leave time for her Truly fashion and accessories brand.
The business had been compared to Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow and was seen as a favourite to double Willoughby &apos; s fortune of about £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving the business, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented, &quot; Holly &apos; s main priority, without question.
It was to be their long-term future, which would keep them going for the next two decades.
Their decision to leave left everyone involved completely stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of pounds due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and could delay the launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on holiday together and Jones had a 40 per cent stake in Baldwin &apos; s television production company.
Willoughby is to become the face of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A close source to Jones said last night "we did not talk business."
A difficult conversation &quot; and then we fell in love &quot;
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of a "news presenter."
“I have not given up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting him again after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea &apos; s chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world &apos; s leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an &quot; adequate &quot; response from the United States to the first steps towards denuclearization of North Korea.
The United States, on the other hand, continued to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump &apos; s speech was much more optimistic than the one he gave at his rally.
We get along great with North Korea, he said.
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
We now have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, assistance in freeing hostages and bringing home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach to the issue of relations with Kim.
It is very easy to be presidential, but then, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this full stadium, we would have 200 people right here, he said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for international aid to be catalysed.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a little,” Mrs. Sumbung explained.
Although Save the Children was preparing a team to go to Palu, it was still uncertain whether foreign staff could work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesperson for the national disaster agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations could be allowed to provide assistance.
Given that Indonesia is a country where land is constantly moving, the country remains woefully unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even with a prior warning, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, travelling from one island to another in Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat earthquake victims was heading for Palu, but would take at least three days to reach the new disaster enclave.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia &apos; s worn-out infrastructure the central theme of his election campaign, and has allocated quite a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is facing re-election next year.
It must also contend with the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equalises for Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea &apos; s goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot and tapped it before kicking it to the second post.
The action was over the area and went to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
Sturridge said: "I was trying to get myself into that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible."
I saw Kante coming and I gave him a little nudge. I didn &apos; t think about it too much, I just let fly.
Chelsea were winning 1-0 at half-time after Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues &apos; half-time substitute, Mateo Kovacic, made a step-over pass to Eden Hazard, who then turned and dribbled into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle.
He then made a lovely pass into the area, which Hazard finished.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished by kicking the ball into the net from the second post with a left-footed shot that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 3 p.m., Liverpool plays Napoli in the Champions League group stage. The match will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Meanwhile, Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 BST in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the Indonesian emergency agency at the beginning of Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves as high as six metres, according to the agency &apos; s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press briefing.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder of a woman who was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews, John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder.
The police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to contact the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, Birkenhead, and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
In addition, he would recommend anyone who may have seen anything on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who claim to know the woman came to the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim &apos; s family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to discover what had happened.
Residents are now being informed that they will be allowed back in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
One woman was seen crying at the scene.
It keeps repeating "it is terrible".
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and one outside.
Several agents remained inside the cordon, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, registration 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament Square becomes the latest commemorative success in "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be a poetic act of justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by its puritanical fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick &apos; s suggestions as "madness" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from Westminster Palace would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
The wrong Cromwell may be sacrificed on the altar of his ancestor Thomas's actions in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft Cromwell is a testimony to the opinion of the nineteenth century and to part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Many people consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, the monarchy.
If it is a completely accurate description, then it is a matter for the historical debate to continue.
What is true is that the mid-seventeenth-century conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A Chinese farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a cattleman at a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pigsty in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, she travelled with her cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that there was a big pig with blood on its mouth in the pit.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig weighing almost 250 kilograms had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
My cousin &apos; s legs were bleeding and broken, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity to The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan &apos; s family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, pigs have attacked people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it away.
After pigs ate a rancher in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious, and their intention is not to hurt.
What is needed is the right respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the south-west United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the north Mexican coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa produced gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, from Sunday morning (5 a.m. Eastern Standard Time) and was located about 620 km south-southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressures are starting to develop in the Pacific, moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States on Monday as Rosa approaches Baja California. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rains northward, towards the south-west United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical cyclone interacts with the approaching low-pressure system, widespread heavy rainfall will occur over the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible desert slides.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation rates of almost 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially in Arizona.
Because of the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall, sudden flash floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions may occur.
Because of the threat of tropical torrential rains, it is absolutely not recommended to go trekking in the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms would cause localized winds and dust clouds.
The approaching low pressure systems will bring strong rains to specific parts of the southern California coast.
Heavy rains may leave as much as two inches of water, which could cause small debris flows and make roads slippery.
This would be the first heavy rains of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before becoming widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and all day Wednesday.
Intense temperature changes in the United States are likely in October due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warming of the tropics.
This sometimes involves drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences will be seen across the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the long-lasting heat of the summer will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures generally in the mid- to upper 20s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probabilities of above-normal temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault, on Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the policy remained stalled and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest developments from Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had groped her while she was drunk and had tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely certain that that had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who Nielsen reported on Friday may have seen it.
The company recorded the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that carried it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has some problems in calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a hearing similar to that of an American football playoff or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh &apos; s nomination, is the leader, averaging 5.69 million viewers for a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 billion, NBC had $2.94 billion, MSNBC had $2.89 billion and CNN had $2.52 billion, Nielsen commented.
After the hearing, there was continued interest.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the morning of Friday, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
While he was being berated, live on CNN, he looked dejected.
Looking me in the face, one woman said.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
And she continued: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Mr. Flake said that his office had issued a press release and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say in his appearance before the Committee.
Cable and broadcast television aired it all live hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to put Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was critical, as it became clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of "playing politics"
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will address the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to share customs duties was "completely absurd".
Wayde murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player &apos; s death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, 20, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder by the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson &apos; s DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A bail bond of USD 350,000 was posted by the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head that had entered the skull.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "in shock" over the death of Wayde.
These are the things that people always worry about, Wade commented.
Volcano spews ash into Mexico City
Ash from Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed signs of activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as &quot; Don Goyo &quot;, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police as thousands of people took to the streets in opposition to the first anniversary of the polarized Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists who had been stopped by the riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally full of tourists.
There were also further clashes later in the day and the police used truncheons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans such as "no forgiveness, no forgetting," faced off against unionists, shouting "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrated.
The voters chose independence by a landslide, although turnout was low, as those who were against secession boycotted the referendum in large numbers.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police attempted to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” she said.
Despite achieving a vital but narrow victory in the December regional elections, the procatalanist parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be standing in the European Parliament elections next year.
To stand for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government.
Londonderry: men arrested for ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday at about 7.30 p.m. on Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that the accesses and the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, the car may have been shot at with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga &apos; s first goal for Livingston ensured the victory
A Livingston promoted impressed Rangers by securing Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of Rangers.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference. Gary Holt's goal moved Hibs up to second place.
This season, Gerrard's team have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table by eight points.
Previously, Rangers would receive Rapid Vienna on a Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their winning streak to six games in the division, with manager Holt still tasting defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against a strong opponent
Holt's team should have been a step ahead much earlier, causing all sorts of problems for Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence but failed to score from close range, before Alan Lithgow deflected a shot from Craig Halkett into the net from a tight angle.
The host team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-holding.
That was how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave them a free shot and Livingston looked for an opening, with a combined play from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that point Rangers were in control of the ball but were unable to break down the home defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was relatively untroubled.
That continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked a Scott Pittman shot with his foot and Livingston were left far from another goal.
Long passes were a constant feature in the Livingston area, but they were always cleared away. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one after Halkett &apos; s shot on Glenn Middleton &apos; s replacement, and one for a hand.
Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous view is that they played a superb game that exceeded expectations of an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and their personnel have hardly changed since their promotion, but this is largely due to Holt, who has strengthened the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was immense and led a superbly organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some very good moments with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize their plays, as they only managed to penetrate the opposition's half once, which is a warning to Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, smiles and blue skies were in evidence at the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Then, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also condemned both Erdogan &apos; s policies and the German government &apos; s decision to welcome him to the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a road accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at about 10.15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended to by the paramedics, but he died there and then.
The accident occurred after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of Saturday &apos; s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the directorate of the prison.
The disturbances began at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 9.30 on Sunday and are still continuing.
A team of elite specialists (known as "Tornado") is in charge of controlling the disturbances, involving eight inmates and affecting one wing.
The officers received minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the prison service commented: "Specialist prison staff have been deployed to deal with the current incident at HMP Long Lartin."
Six staff members have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.”
Long Lartin prison holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which prison staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen early next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep through the Southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern Nevada and eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix commented in a tweet that only 10 hurricanes had maintained their tropical or depression state within a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of torrential rain, which can reach 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 cm, with the possibility of up to 10 cm in isolated areas in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places not at risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rains are considered a blessing, as the region is suffering from drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial because of the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which is still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 km/h, is 619 km south-southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm is encountering cooler waters in the Pacific, and is losing strength.
It is expected to hit Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
“Heavy rains of between 7 and 15 centimetres are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimetres, as reported by weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border by early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then move southward into Utah by late Tuesday night.
The main danger to Rosa or her remains is the torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and southwest United States.
These rains are expected to cause sudden flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, at about 4am on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he is &quot; stable &quot;.
Three 17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to the Avon and Somerset Constabulary.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party"
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the despicable and disgusting tactics of the Democrat Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "suffered the meanness and the anger of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process."
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers, testifying emotionally and forcefully.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, "Americans saw the shrewdness, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an admirable record of public service,” he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The President made indirect references to Judge Kavanaugh &apos; s candidacy in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not running, but I am running,” he said.
That is why I go from one place to another, fighting to get good candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in a quake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in the city of Palu to celebrate a festival on Friday night when waves as high as six metres hit the coast in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When yesterday it was reported that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management and Mitigation (BNPB, in Indonesian) in a press briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, and everything on land, he said. The tsunami had moved at a speed of 800 km/h in the open sea before hitting the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 evacuation centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Shelling continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in a region with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT, by its Indonesian acronym) reported in a press release that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which was built on the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant," saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, and 540 persons were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300-kilometre stretch of coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, he said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
That was already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse, he said.
On Saturday, the agency came under fire for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities say that the waves had already reached the coast by the time the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man can be heard warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in the vicinity of Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army began to send cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuees still needed food and other basic supplies.
The city &apos; s airport had reopened for relief work only and would remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centres in Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
That is very bad.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala had arrived safely in Palu, where staff were sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they had seen a devastating scene on their way, he said.
He said that he had been told that many houses had been destroyed.
That is very bad.
Even as the aid groups were putting the machinery of disaster assistance into motion, some people were complaining that the movement of experienced relief workers to Palu was not being allowed.
Under Indonesian regulations, only foreign financing, supplies and the deployment of foreign personnel may be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
That has not yet happened.
Aulia Arriani, the Indonesian Red Cross spokesperson, said, &quot; It is still a disaster at the provincial level. &quot;
As soon as the Government says that it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but that has not happened yet.
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the devastating stories that natural disasters write.
On Saturday, a small child was rescued from a manhole.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other students of his who were trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among them.
“As a paraglider, I carry my own emotional baggage,” he commented.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the parapente community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, their messages only showed a grey verification mark, not two blue ones.
He said that he believed that the messages had not been delivered.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a cash reload at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, two armed robbers robbed a Brink employee who was loading an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM machine located in the entertainment centre and was preparing to reload it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running up behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money intended for reloading.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person with information on the identities of the deceased should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will now be known as Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time now, and he used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously stated that the word had a religious significance for him.
I think it is the most used word in the Bible, which means 'you,' West said early this year while talking about the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
"I am you, you are me, means we.
He went from Kanye, which means 'the only one', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, Jay-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without quotation marks.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use army against civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected Mexican President, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Square that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has committed himself to supporting Mexican youth by providing them with monthly stipends for those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by several US Government actors, even when the US lacks an official IAL strategy.
In the meantime, China has submitted its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in IA by 2030.
Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging far behind the United States. We are looking forward to the next step in the I.A. field, comments Lee.
Double the funding means double the chances that the next great achievement in I. A. will be achieved in the United States, as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book &quot; AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order &quot; was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China &apos; s most important facial recognition companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a chess-playing system that defeated the best American player of Othello. Subsequently, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
He commended previous United States Government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often had to work hard to obtain government grants, Lee commented.
It is not China that is taking the lead in attracting the academic leaders; it is the corporations, Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent academics to work on I. A.
Lee commented that changes in US migration policy could also help the United States to intensify its efforts in I. A.
I think that doctors in I. A. should be given permanent residence cards automatically, he said.
The Chinese State Council submitted its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) funds people from academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee commented.
In early this year, the United States Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, whose purpose is to attract partners from industry and academia. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a new initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research into AI.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change their name.
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name will change to "Republic of Macedonia North", a gesture that will resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its membership bid in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Slav majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the minimum required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question was: 'Do you support the accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
The proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to enable Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopie.
Although it will not be legally binding, a number of Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote so that it will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared that, at 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, participation was only 16 %, compared with 34 % in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, said: "I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe."
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko Zaev cast their vote in the referendum on changing the name of the country in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents of those who were boycotting the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our heads held high, not through the back door.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that joining NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, whose unemployment rate is over 20 per cent.
I believe that the majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future."
A survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Studies claimed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which would be lower than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV, in Macedonia, revealed that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, evades the whole Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore through the Brighton defence to score two goals in Manchester City &apos; s 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentinean centre-back received a yellow card in the first minute of the match.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking into open play.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded one defender before beating several more on the Brighton byline.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who struck it with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot that hit the right post.
City manager Pep Guardiola said Aguero had some problems with his foot.
We said it would take between 55 and 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky to score at that moment.”
However, it was Sterling who gave City the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton goal.
He made a lovely ball down the left wing for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few taps before sending him to the second mast.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net just before he went off the pitch.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies &apos; party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies at least secured one wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still chasing their first division title.
Although we did not risk anything, at least we can step on the gum with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and that the other team probably played at the highest level I have faced this year.
Why would you not want to participate?”
Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but it looks like they are leaning towards letting Scherzer go in that situation.
Scherzer, who will open the session on Thursday, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest day on Sunday.
The record of Washington's pitcher is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation, his selection to the Supreme Court, when speaking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
In November everything we have done is at stake.
There are five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is one of the most important. I am not running, but I am fighting for great candidates, and I am going from one place to another to get them,” he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of democrats, they are doing it now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, and we see the meanness, the wickedness.
They do not care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control. And we are not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, were embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
“We have seen it these last four days,” he said, saying that Democrats were “angry, bad, horrible and false.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, nominating Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, I hope for an answer. Your body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour Members of Parliament who are told that we are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way to be categorically against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, for Europe. It was ironic that it was on issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice for the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.
During the greater part of the eight years that I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a'more friendly and compassionate' policy has long since been forgotten, if it was ever implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on whether or not the party leadership considers it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to radically change his mind and adopt positions with which he would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the centre's policies, saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one to have experienced this.
I am indeed aware that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, as my comments tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist insults, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that broad range of opinions, and with every 'censorship' motion or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice telling me to keep my head down and not to make too much noise, so that I would be 'all right'.
But I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a schoolboy, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher Government which left my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a Minister in Government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, and I have never done so in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions and areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday is that I do not understand this urge to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will stop me from acting in what I believe to be best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr invincible rises to the top
Two late tries may have decided the final outcome, but Ayr certainly deserved the victory in this entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now the top team in the table and the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make better use of opportunities, that gave the local team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
“We have been tested in all the games and we have come through, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: "Ayr deserves the recognition, they took their opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's try at 14, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card shown to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, on loan from the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage and Jason Baggot's try was not converted.
Ayr extended their lead with a penalty. Just before the interval, Ayr scored and converted a solo try, leaving the score at 17-5 in their favour at the break.
However, Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson &apos; s try, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long stoppage after Ruaridh Knott sustained a serious injury and had to be stretchered off, and Ayr went on to lead 1-0 at the time of the restart, with Stafford McDowall &apos; s shot converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having one more man with a non-converted Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of huge pressure.
However, the premises were recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for placating Climo without the ball, from the line-out, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul, which was advancing.
The weather converted it, as it had been doing almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong and kicked it out of the hands of Gregor Henry, who was left flat on his back in the corner.
Still Game star wants to steer his career towards the catering industry
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the catering business after it was revealed that he had been appointed manager of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis, the famous BBC programme, which he writes and co-stars with his long-standing comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth series will be the last, and Kiernan seems to be making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source at the Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming Glasgow restaurant scene."
Bolivia without a coast: a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the Pacific route
Navy personnel are stationed at a naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying in public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
It is a duty to recover it.
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, the lost coast, which was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the nineteenth century, and the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean again, are still vividly remembered.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is expecting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and calm, and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision, commented Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens set up throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia &apos; s claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has an obligation to negotiate with Bolivia to grant it sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is embroiled in a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution on Monday.
He promised in late August that we were very close to returning to the Pacific.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the tribunal will rule in Bolivia &apos; s favour and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice &apos; s resolution came only six months after the final submissions indicated that the case was &quot; not complicated &quot;, said Chilean expert Paz Zárate.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
The problem of access to the sea had been seized by the current Bolivian administration, he said.
It also suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales had undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to keep talking after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian representative to The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, rejected the idea that the court &apos; s decision-making was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia would be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and to put an end to 139 years of mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
Bolivia would never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The resolution was an opportunity to move on from the past.
North Korea says that there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation would never be the first to give up nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made at a summit meeting in Singapore between the rival leaders.
Your comments come at a time when Mike Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, appears to be on the verge of restarting a diplomatic nuclear dialogue that has been stalled for more than three months since this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
He said that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the United States &apos; opposition to a declaration that would end the Korean War and bring North Korea to its knees was a &quot; chimera &quot;.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without some meaningful disarmament movement by Pyongyang first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is a general scepticism about North Korea &apos; s seriousness in giving up an arsenal that the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is expected to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of enormous hats about to land on a street of shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you need look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a collection of eccentric large hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino &apos; s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large-size accessories included a watermelon with jewels, a witch &apos; s hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-up lips and bore a more Hannibal Lecter look than haute couture.
One creation resembled a full diving team, including snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you are in luck.
The haters of style predict that the huge hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
Big hats are back in a big way, thanks to "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a 60-centimetre brim worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand that made this impractical hat so popular on social media presented another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini that she was wearing.
The raffia-woven orange-brown bag, decorated with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at the Paris Fashion Week.
As stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets of the high street. Since the designer has had such a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories."
John Edward: linguistic skills are vital for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the exams, which is further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for short), are striving to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are intended to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, modern languages are still popular and in demand in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, &quot; If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart. &quot;
If you speak to them in their language, you reach their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if one wants to establish relations and build trust with people from other countries, one cannot rely solely on English.
If we look at the recent results of this year &apos; s examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables, with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
Data from the 74 centres in the SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A in Chinese, 72 per cent in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that will be needed by children and young people in the future without doubt.
Languages are currently considered to be on a par with the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere else.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that, of the reasons given by employers for difficulties in filling jobs, 17% were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming ever more indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential for language skills in the workplace is increasing, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career path someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to this kind of skill, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with persons from foreign countries will enable that person to automatically gain an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 per cent, was French.
That is why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child &apos; s interests, independent schools always offer a choice of languages taught by specialist staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing an environment of learning that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages still have a vital role to play in the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered &quot; languages for international communication &quot;.
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Well, we must.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James makes Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait for LeBron James &apos; s debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the season opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is still unclear how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton commented on the Lakers &apos; official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play limited minutes.
After a training session early this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers &apos; six-game preseason schedule.
At this stage of my career, I do not need pre-season parties to prepare myself, he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is holding a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump campaign events scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when ballots are cast in November.
What time is Trump &apos; s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. this evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch it online via a live YouTube stream.
Trump is likely to comment on this week &apos; s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which were overshadowed by allegations of sexual misconduct and have left a Senate vote of confirmation on hold for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections to gain momentum.
The Trump campaign noted that the five rallies next week are intended to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House," according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in campaign, said a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named.
The rally scheduled for tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage from Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is falling behind in the polls.
For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has to come and give him a push in the polls, Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows that it is willing to fight to keep the hope alive for the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
Where, then, would you say the impetus is now?
“We were six points down and now we are four points down, so I guess that is a little bit of a push,” Jordan Spieth said after the round.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth notes, the Americans feel they have a bit of wind behind them and plenty of reasons to be cheerful, among them the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and combined for 4 points out of 4.
Spieth has been deadly off the tee and preaches with his example.
The guttural roars of celebration grew louder as the pair's round progressed, introducing a vital putt for a vital par to level the fourth round when they were two down after two.
The putt that gave them the lead on the 15th was greeted with a similar cry, one that said that he still believed that the American team was not out of the game.
What needed to be done was to redouble efforts and focus on the party, he said.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable couple of Europe are four from four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only pair to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That run and the way he is playing with the crowd clearly shows that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and there will be no other players more popular than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun goes down at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in separate holes.
However, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning, after pairing with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help on Sunday to get out of the holes.
The foursomes and fourballs are fascinating to watch up close because you see the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and do not give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team is willing to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the foursomes and fourballs with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The Fleetwood-Molinari duo led the contest with two wins over Tiger Woods, who was in trouble, gaining four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a US team that made many errors in the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points. He and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their brilliant partnership served to beat a dejected Woods and the American rookie Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who had not really shone in the two matches on Saturday, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world #1 and #3 players respectively, 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the south-west of Paris, Europe was not having all its own way.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas served as a reference point for the Americans, with two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish player Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has ever recovered from a four-point deficit in the singles matches, but Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that there is "no possibility" of unilateral disarmament unless it has confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his country &apos; s distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country &apos; s unilateral nuclear disarmament under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the international agency that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" last year, including stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received any similar response from the United States.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of our unilateral disarmament.
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington &apos; s resistance to a phased denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an American president in office and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official goal of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can be trusted.
Washington has also resisted calls for softening international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States had insisted on nuclear disarmament first and had increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a statement on the termination of war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our mistrust.
Ri made no mention of any plans for a second Trump-Kim summit, announced with great fanfare by the United States leader at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea, in the past five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri &apos; s tone of speech was radically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles to US soil after &quot; malignant president &quot; Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim &quot; rocket man &quot;.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and that sanctions should continue to be applied until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize a fully verified and verifiable denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang &apos; s ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours, North Korea had denounced its "demands as those of a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantling a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States &apos; &quot; corresponding measures &quot; were implemented.
He said that Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to sleep enough
Thanks to a new course being offered this year at Harvard University, all university students are now sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of all-night caffeine-fuelled cramming.
A professor discovered that students at the world &apos; s number one university have little idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was only hearing about this now, in her final year.
He said that nobody had ever told him the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos; s health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only a few hours a week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section has an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a routine for going to bed.
In another section, participants are informed that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Afterwards, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that students will not change their behaviour immediately.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He stated that the culture of pride in "staying up all night" still exists and added that modern technology and increased pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and good-quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so students are always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
The next step would be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar programme of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler &apos; s recommendation is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by screens and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so that they will have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 Rangers 0: Menga goal crushes Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another away-day depression when the Dolly Menga attack saw Steven Gerrard &apos; s disjointed team go down 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted their first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side won for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, who lead the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga &apos; s attack came just minutes before half-time and Rangers &apos; poor shape was never in question.
Now Rangers drop to sixth, Livingston rise to third, behind Hibs by goal difference.
The Rangers may have more problems, as judge of the line Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after allegedly being hit by an object from the visiting team.
Gerrard changed eight of the players who won the game against Ayr, reaching the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, took 11 Livingston players who earned a point for Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his organised team suffocated their opponents throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have marked at two minutes when Menga made a pass into space for Scott Pittman, who passed through the defence, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs was penalised for a high tackle on captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send it out over the sideline.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction in their play in the third period.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored his Colombian counterpart's request.
Rangers got two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly barely had to break sweat to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame effort.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute was against the run of play, nobody can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, Rangers were unable to deal with a deep ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to score.
On the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and almost immediately the ball was played to Morelos, who played it to Kelly, but the impressive Kelly stepped into his line to block it.
However, Livingston continued to take the visitors exactly where he wanted them, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing a long ball after long ball.
Holt could have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed home a corner that did not go in.
Ranger substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty late in the game after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the &quot; Sunday Morning &quot; newspaper, 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and counting... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm &quot; Hans &quot; Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Big Country," with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the earphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a common protein in many cancers and re-inject it.
A vaccine trial is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein called HER2 in many cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes growth of different types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West went on a rant in support of Trump with a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It did not work out.
Kanye West was booed in the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I talk to white people all the time and they ask me how I can like Trump, who is racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago, he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch of Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted the recording of West &apos; s rant on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the audience that he had had a bad time backstage because he was wearing the hat.
They messed with me.
They told me not to wear my hat.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I am asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see me asleep?" and added that he was "going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant that nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Try with love.”
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine, "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West left many bemused when he came on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier and sang I Love it.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
But I decide not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) whom I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology in my community.
He is free.
We also”, he added.
Before the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as P Diddy, Puff Daddy and Puffy.
Your colleague Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the legendary musician Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those roles on screen often transmitted to young boys that they had to be hard to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that "something went wrong" and questioned how to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit Harrington, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he thought it was "fairly important" to address the issue.
Personally, I think it is quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?
What have we been teaching men as they grow up, thinking about the problems they see now?
Kit believes that television can have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on television and in the street that makes young people feel that they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any spin-offs or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he was "tired of battlefields and horses."
In November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
He recently revealed that he believes knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he has taken away from Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, I have given my future family and life from now on,
Rose played Ygritte, Kit Harrington &apos; s love interest on the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm belonging to Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced an increase of 14 per cent in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of these were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been reduced to a very small extent, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community suffers much discrimination.
Because of the country &apos; s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 and 90 per cent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked information about Republican senators and says it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three United States Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said that those allegations were being driven by commentators and websites on the &quot; far right &quot;.
“Lies, lies and more lies,” Waters commented on Twitter.
The information published reportedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with Waters &apos; office and released the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a total lie, continued Waters.
The member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a total lie.”
Waters &apos; s statement was immediately criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
He wrote, "This information is false and I am angry about it."
This suggests that the necessary temperance to be a Member of Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
It should not rebel.
The prosecutor &apos; s motives should not be questioned.
It must remain calm and serene.”
It seems that Fleischer was trying to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of seeming too angry during his Thursday testimony.
Republican Omar Navarro, who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If that is true, that is very serious, he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations."
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally accountable for all these destructive and dangerous acts against all my staff members.
Johnny English: Back in Action: Rowan Atkinson's spy spoof is a bit of a let-down
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new film with a British slant. It seems that this is what is expected of this new Johnny English spin-off action and comedy franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this ironic self-satire about our clearly ridiculous nature be the new opportunity for exporting the nation?
In any case, Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his licence to make a fool of himself for the second time. His name alone gives clues that he is a comic creation aimed at territories where the cinema is not spoken in English.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent, despite its strange claims to glamour, who has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a hint of that type who touched on the subject of the Cars film at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Furthermore, it was originally based on the mysterious man traveller and international representative, as portrayed by Atkinson years ago in the now forgotten Barclaycard television adverts, causing chaos in his wake.
There are one or two good moments in this last instalment.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter in full medieval armour, while the rotors were smashing into his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but the humour is somewhat lacking and is especially superfluous now that franchises such as James Bond and Mission: Impossible are adding comic ingredients without problems.
The humour seems more aimed at children than adults, and for me, the ridiculous adventures of Johnny English are not as clever and well-timed as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr Bean.
The repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in deep trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent in the field, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the final straw for the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered figure who is seeing her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this role, which is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to recruit one who is retired.
That is the bumbling Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, although he gives unofficial lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy school like Rock School.
English is moved to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets his old pal Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married submariner captain, a role that Vicki Pepperdine does not exploit enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a charismatic multi-millionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; moreover, English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta &apos; s house.
The last sequence was definitely well used, but the whole thing still has a rather childish feel to it.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I could not help wondering whether the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan to make Britons work four days a week and get five days off.
The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week, but get five.
The party allegedly wants the owners of AI companies to allocate the savings from the AI revolution to the workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "fits" into the party &apos; s economic plans and agenda, and would tilt the country towards the workers.
This change to a four-day week has the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way of workers making the most of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party figure commented to The Sunday Times: a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
"The four-day week will not be achieved overnight, but the party is definitely committed to it as a matter of course, and it is also part of the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such ideas, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, at present not all Labour Party members are in favour of this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: 'The four-day week is not party policy and will not be discussed at this time.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was prepared to recover powers of "anonymous directors" and "well-paid" directors of public service companies.
One of the shadow minister's plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders in water companies should not get back all their shares, since a Labour government might apply deductions to cover the irregularities that had been detected.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10 per cent of the shares of private sector companies would be allocated to employees, which would yield annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has at least delayed by a week the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court judge, and raises the question of whether the results could influence any Republican Senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could produce information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
I was in favour of the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, and unequivocal."
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it flatly," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the persons she named has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive roster of stars in support of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park &apos; s Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be educated on the real purpose of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they could afford a VIP ticket), concert-goers had to complete a series of tasks or "actions," such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, making a phone call or any other activity that would raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
What has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of striving to reach its goal?
The idea of a free concert as a genuine way of persuading people to take action or not is a genuine way of persuading people or is it just another form of 'clicktivism', which is the term we use for the position we take when we think we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favour of a wide range of various objectives.
Through these actions, they claim to have secured commitments and policies worth over $37 billion from global leaders, which will impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By early 2018, the group had cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly impacted almost 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition," a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom, with a common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential." To that end, $35 million has been proposed to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country, following more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
"Thanks to the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a small step in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," Tracey Ullman, ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", told the crowd at a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions asked on our website about what we think can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen partner responded: "It will be a long and hard road, and we will stumble and fall many times along the way.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already shown, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are just some of the performances we have lined up for the New York event this year, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement the energy export embargo on Russia - Interior Ministry
"If necessary," Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the Russian alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is just a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate energetically, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the most southern supplier in Europe," he said.
Moreover, according to official information, there are ways and methods of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market, he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the consumer voice in energy in the United States."
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to exploit and replace fuels," he warned, adding that Russia could only do one thing, which was to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made at a time when the Trump administration has been trying to push liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including the President himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has always insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is worth $11 billion and is intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington &apos; s fierce opposition to the project is only economic in nature and is yet another example of unfair competition.
I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow last September.
The United States position has, however, been met with a rejection by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry organization that leads the industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a major problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider running for president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a hearing at the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women in leadership, she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a speech at the Town Hall and said that "he was taking the country down the wrong path."
I really am concerned about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke without hesitation about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
A poll was published on Thursday, however, which showed that a majority of Warren &apos; s own voters do not believe she should run for President in 2020.
A Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll found that 58 per cent of potential Massachusetts voters said Senator Kerry should not run.
A 32 per cent of those surveyed did, however, support his candidacy.
The survey showed a greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy in 2020 of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin &apos; s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"The situation my son is going through, everything that has happened since he returned, you know it very well, the other families that suffer the effects of TBI and other wounds that our soldiers return with, you know it very well," she said at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that nobody wants to talk about, and commented on her son and other veterans of war that "they come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there is really that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on a domestic violence charge, which interfered with a domestic violence complaint and a weapons charge under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to develop a new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia support a judicial challenge to the new United States policy that denies asylum to domestic violence and gang rape victims.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a "friendly letter" to Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum seeker who is currently facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" filed by the ACLU in August against the federal policy was not revealed.
She said that her partner and his children, who were members of a violent gang, had abused her, but the United States officials denied her asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations facing generalized problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States reversed a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum in this country.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, made statements on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum applications must be decided on the facts and circumstances of the particular case and, instead, this exception violates that principle.
The lawyers also noted in their brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, as it often results in immigrants becoming entrepreneurs more frequently and "provides a needed workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to deny asylum to domestic violence and gang abuse victims.
People can apply for asylum if they leave their countries of origin because of persecution or threats of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said when he announced this directive on 11 June.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all problems, let alone all serious problems, that people around the world faced daily.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming ever more dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us that the situation was very tense as she tried to comfort her feverish baby at a relief centre in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search through the few belongings they have left in an effort to salvage what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, which were also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, were lying outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building because of the continuing aftershocks, which were also very strong.
She could not help but cry as she told us about the violent earthquake that she had experienced while she was on the fifth floor of the hotel with her husband and daughter.
We did not have time to get away.
I was trapped in the rubble, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help and then a terrible silence.
I do not know what has happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper was published by a Chinese official newspaper, promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the United States Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, the United States President, Donald Trump, referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely read newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the United States Congress elections on 6 November, something that China denies vehemently.
The Trump administration &apos; s accusation that Beijing tried to influence the US elections marked a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led to both sides raising tariff levels on imports from each other.
China &apos; s compensatory tariffs that were in place at the start of the trade war were designed to fall on exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Donald Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and business people.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China &apos; s "pressure is intensifying further with advertisements in our free press."
To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and free press by trying to place an advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
In contrast, in the newsstand in Beijing where we are now, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that their economy is taking, because the media are controlled by the strong pressure of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, but did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts note that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are rallying behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially among women, could occur in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense, and many Republicans have expressed their desire to proceed with the vote.
In this type of matter, it is not possible to go back," said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake &apos; s latest attempt to position himself in favour of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm disgruntled voters.
Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered outside the Senate were chanting "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) as the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is way beyond any prediction," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
People say that the impact is already very significant, and that is indeed the case.
But it could be even greater, especially among indecisive women from the outskirts of the cities and the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote, even though they do not like the president."
Even before Ford &apos; s public testimony in which he detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had indicated that a backlash could occur if the Republicans pressed ahead with the confirmation.
This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele told NBC News early last week.
It is no longer just a question of the committee vote and the final vote, or even whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench; it is also about how the Republicans have handled all this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know whom to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are siding with Kavanaugh.
In a new YouGov poll, 41 per cent of respondents said they believed Ford &apos; s testimony, while 35 per cent said they believed Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony.
In addition, 38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while 30 per cent said the same of Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is now investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while she was drunk at age 17.
Ramirez, for his part, claimed that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the technology legend. A company based on the open source Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "to rule the world."
It must be now, he said about Startup.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid technology to enable users to create their own "online personal data store" or POD.
It can contain lists, task lists, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique to online personal data storage is that the user is the one who decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it &quot; personal data training &quot;.
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company &apos; s chief executive officer, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
For now, the company is made up of Tim Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers on staff working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce a radical change where all their business models are going to be completely changed overnight.
We are not going to ask for permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on network neutrality.
Even as Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only English Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, their two grandchildren found a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "a very symbolic thing" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the decoration.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under intense machine-gun and artillery fire."
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery," pushed the line forward before reaching a single-barrelled gun and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather &apos; s actions were "so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is made clear when he is shown such a strong show of support."
MMA fans stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 only to be denied the main event.
The San Jose poster had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was going to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom that night.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face off, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a big joke."
There is government regulation of the content that is broadcast after 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said that they will be changing the format to include British viewers in the next editions.
When I think about the option of retransmission, I think it can work," Coker said.
But it is at 6 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are looking at how to do that.
Believe me, when the programme was changed, a great many messages were received, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to sort it out, because we thought it was a technical problem at first.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise that it will not happen again.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is the usual number, in order to offer more than usual so that the fans are happy and we go over.
That was a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but this was what motivated him to become a winner.
At 24, he told us that he did not realize that not everyone was like him until he went to secondary school.
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that his intention in talking about gay rights was to "transmit hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to lose interest in winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this mythical programme, Kirsty Young, is going to be off sick for a few months.
In the first Laverne, Daley, who had himself been a social outcast, commented that he had felt "inferior" to the rest of the children during his childhood because "socially it was not acceptable to like boys and girls."
She said: "Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he was not disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent face of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he told his story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass on that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion declared that it was also a surprise for her to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years his senior, although he specified that the age difference had never been an issue.
When you live so long from such a young age (she was at her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
"If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have been about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without doubt, Robbie."
His son is named Robert, after his father, Robert, who died at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and indeed one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I was not able to tell him that I could not be in the front row," he said.
She said, "I had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it was only then that I realized that he was not invincible."
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
At that moment I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better," he said.
This was also the inspiration behind her first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied her during the preparation for the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, sat on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad statistic.
Mickelson, who was playing in the biennial event to break his record for the 12th time, was replaced by Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has been so many times for the United States, the five-time major champion had to cheer on at times and, at others, try to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what was wrong.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form for Le Golf National, where the long rough constantly punishes errant shots.
And if the field is not sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth round on Sunday, faces the brilliant Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four shots down after the first 12 individual matches, had started their comeback in such an impressive fashion, Mickelson's match might have been the decider.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, and he could not say much more.
He understood perfectly the role he had today, he gave me a pat on the back and, wrapping his arm around me, said he would be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably did not imagine playing two games.
We thought it would be more, but that is how it came out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, just like the rest of them."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass the mark of Nick Faldo for most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a Ryder Cup career that had never been so clearly defined by his individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He is fun, sarcastic, clever, he likes to mock others; he is a great guy to have on the team.
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as a support, and this week too, it was fun.
It is much more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although he has a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, he can easily turn it into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a Seve Ballesteros-led American team held a five-point lead over the Europeans, but in the end they were only able to finish a minimum of one point ahead, winning 14½-13½.
"You keep reminding me that we won a great tournament at Valderrama; we also won at Brookline and lost, we won at Valderrama and won, but by a whisker," Bjorn said, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead by 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
History will teach us and the world that this team is not finished.
You have to give it your all tomorrow.
Get out of here and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the board.
We have a target to achieve, and that is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where there are the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players had done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn &apos; t want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is important tomorrow is individual action, and that is different.
It is great to share what is happening with a partner when things are going well, but when things are not going well, you are really tested as a golfer.
That is the message that we need to send to the players, to give their best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner behind and go and do your best."
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be hoping that his players can do better individually than they did as a pair, with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points on four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the last few days of these great tournaments and has been part of the winning team at Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
He remembered every word, when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had motivated his players on the final day.
We have 12 super-imports tomorrow, but we have to play as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in the same direction, all the pressure falls on the middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole trip," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era vessels, but it will not be until at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a statement by a military spokesman cited by the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery delayed the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and decoys, and some stealth technologies, such as radar, IR and acoustic signatures, which are very small.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, enabling deployment for up to two years away from the home port.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the oceans) will already be outdated when they start to serve, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was officially handed over to the German Navy last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the frigate and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time that a ship had been returned to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "critical software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly serious, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also noted that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy &apos; s ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the 'Rheinland-Pfalz' of 7,000 tons is twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is estimated that the cost has now reached EUR 3.1 billion (USD 4.2 billion), instead of the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction in the naval power of Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy was "losing ships that can be deployed."
The officer said that the problem had been aggravated over time, because old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a Highland Scottish landscape, is trying to find out how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
All that is found will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton &apos; s bat and the brown long-eared bat of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track bat activity during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Experts will analyse the sounds picked up on the recordings to identify the frequency of calls by bats and the species that make them.
A habitat report and map will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be managed for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affects their nests and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical cabling can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind,
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in achieving their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescue operations.
The organisation has even opened the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in Scotland in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
Here at Threave we have a fantastic bat site," he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and the right habitat.
However, there is still much to be learned about bats, and the work we are doing here and at other properties will help us to better understand what they need to thrive."
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance work within the property, as a colony of bats can be accidentally destroyed and up to 400 females and young can be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Scotland &apos; s Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species on which we know little about their populations."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations as "fake news," and says that people are "trying to get their name out there" at his expense.
His lawyers had been instructed to lodge a complaint against the German magazine Der Spiegel, where the statements had been published.
The forward for Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying 375,000 dollars to the man to keep quiet about the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already garnered 142 million followers just hours after the news was released, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today was false," he said, looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but I can't help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo &apos; s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they have called &quot; an unacceptable report on suspicions of privacy &quot;, according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, the player &apos; s lawyer, said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
According to reports, the alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player &apos; s room and there, Ronaldo is alleged to have raped Mayorga anally, according to the documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was a "99 per cent good boy" and that he had let him down by one per cent.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and that they took photographs of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was "afraid of reprisals" and concerned about being humiliated in public.
The woman, 34, claims to be trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a big name in Italian football on a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: the UK will always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if we lost our global lead in car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disconcerting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of delays at the border in the case of a Brexit without an agreement could result in the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced around 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production bottlenecks in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the general manager of Toyota Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal, especially in relation to cross-border trade; including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the problems that could arise in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on the just-in-time (JIT) method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU to make cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would be unable to house the equivalent of more than one day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, which sets out the future relationship with the EU, was "calibrated precisely to avoid these checks at the border".
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will not only see us through this moment but will take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a very successful supply chain.
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production will be stopped, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite shop steward at the plant, said that his members were becoming increasingly concerned: 'According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they are never recovered.'
A government spokesman said: 'We have put in place a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU.'
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, White House says
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week," the White House said Sunday, as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, connections between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump might fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus compromise Mueller &apos; s independence, has fuelled gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone that he himself carried to try to get rid of the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, where he was reported to be on the verge of resigning.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not to" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the Senate vote.
Trump &apos; s press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court."
We will decide on the spot and I will inform the press as I usually do."
Some journalists would dispute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the lack of press access was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who act grandiloquently, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they do."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President holds more question and answer sessions than any other President before him, he said, while citing "unsubstantiated" figures.
Press briefings would continue, he said, but "if the press has the option of asking the President directly, I think that is much better than asking me."
We have tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are very rare.
Indeed, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why he was so, where he made an uncharacteristically casual and, at times, bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish Government writes to NHS staff in Scotland about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working in the HSCI in Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and its wish to continue working with them post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU nationals working in non-devolved public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: 'During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on the exit, with the expectation of making decisions this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom Government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know that all this must be very confusing for you.
And it is for that reason that I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each and every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
EU and other professionals bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is, without doubt, your home and we would love to continue to have you as part of our family."
Christion Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head wound
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers football player, was taken to the hospital for emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday, when the Tigers lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
He came to a stop and fell over there, Reed said.
Both the coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A staff member at Tennessee State Hospital told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury or damage yet" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding a total of 18 tackles for the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher transfer tax when they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be subject to a higher land transfer tax when they buy property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to house the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's offensive in attracting younger voters
The increase in the land transfer tax will be imposed on those persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year for the homeless.
The additional money raised from the increase in the stamp duty on foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralise the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in the land transfer tax will be levied on non-UK taxpayers and the money will be used to incentivise the Government &apos; s policy to tackle begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is an additional levy on the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the 'buy-to-let' system, could reach up to 3 per cent.
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year from this change.
It is estimated that 13% of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which is causing prices to rise and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country &apos; s wealthiest areas (especially the capital) had become &quot; ghost towns &quot; because of the large number of foreign buyers who spent most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping property prices high by buying land in bulk without any intention of using it and urged Mrs May to abolish the affordable housing levy to solve the "shameful housing problem" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a very attractive series of reforms for housing, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the life chances of every new generation.
That means dealing with the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of sleeping on the streets is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary objective" is to become a Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited at the prospect of reviving the north-east club, which currently occupies third place in League One (the third tier of English football), three points behind the top club.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child and it has always made me want to go back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I can successfully manage a club."
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he moved from a club with such a big name to a club as big as Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, success for me is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club are certainly those of the Premier League," he said.
It is not easy to achieve, but I would only consider myself to have achieved my aim here if I could return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint in the Hearts technical department.
He helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and helped St. Mirren go from being on the brink of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he has never felt more comfortable in his career than he does now, having played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled in reference to his time at Alloa.
I always thought that management was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, but it was good, I was able to make a living from it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure from this work, but I feel well in the direction.
I always wanted to train and now I have managed to do so, it is the time of my adult life when I have felt better, without a doubt."
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Monday, 30 September, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday
The summer heatwave has boosted sales in British pubs that are struggling to survive, but all the pressure has been on the restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA Business Consulting, which compiled the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have meant that July has followed the pattern of June, in which pubs increased their sales by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants have fallen back a little further.
The 1.8 per cent fall in retail trade in restaurants in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly alcoholic drinks had their strongest month, against the majority of restaurants, where they reduced their profits.
The pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered from the heat, although not to the same extent as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just want to go out to drink.
In managed bars and pubs, sales of alcoholic beverages rose by 6.6 per cent during the month, while sales of meals fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, hospitality and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April."
The time and impact of major social or sporting events or events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the home-based market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8% fall in sales compared with last year is going to be particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long and warm summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering industry and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, data is collected and analysed for 47 operational groups with combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media, away from their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret accounts on social media networks, according to a survey
The survey, conducted among 20 000 secondary school students, revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit content will be published
20 per cent of pupils said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that hide them from adults.
A survey of 20 000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a site that is a reference for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit content will be published.
One in five students reported having a "main" account that they showed their parents, while having other accounts that they kept secret.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter was shocked to see a teenager encouraging others to "rape me."
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete on both track and field and Ian Beattie, the president of the Scottish Athletics Federation, described the change as a great opportunity for those who believe that sport benefits from its great international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish athletics community, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from having her on the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can bring things and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games between the four gold medals he won and who is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischaemic attack which left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: &quot; A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am now doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the breast pump where mothers are compared to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A breast-pump company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "world &apos; s first silent breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with a bit of ironic music that shows mothers talking about the freedom they get from the new breast pump.
Four real women dance in a hay barn, with cows, with signs such as "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they are not udders, they are my breasts."
The chorus continues to sing: "Feed them, feed them, I am feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I am feeding my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company &apos; s Facebook page, has caused a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say that it brings the horrors of the dairy sector to the fore.
A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after giving birth," wrote one person.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: &quot; Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who do stay at home?"
Another comment was: "What a ridiculous announcement."
However, other people defended the announcement, including a woman who admitted that the song was "distasteful."
I think that is a great idea.
If she were still breast-feeding, she would have one.
When I used the pump, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit wild, but I do not want to dwell on it.
It is a brilliant product,” one woman told us.
Another person commented: "It is a funny announcement aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.
The video ends with the women showing that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside their brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who express milk with a pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to a nursing bra, making it possible for users to move, hold their babies and even go out in public with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, a Mother partner and ECD, tells us: &quot; The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time that the Elvie bomb has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children discreetly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased significantly, despite the fact that the monthly inflow at the border has remained at near-normal levels. In part, this is due to the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are making it more difficult to place these children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take in a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal records.
Around 80 per cent of sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we are still pursuing these individuals,” said Albence.
In their efforts to process juveniles more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from the time of arrest, instead of 60 days, as the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reports from the centres of reception and from the system itself over the past few months, the longer they are held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the defenders, these concerns are even more acute in larger facilities, such as the one at Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of distress in these children will be overlooked.
Furthermore, the transfer to the camp without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma, which many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country &apos; s war has been in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Vice-Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the matter would be dealt with "in accordance with the law."
“They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war against terrorism is practically over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any foreign illegal presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advice to the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "planting irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
We have requested the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns, he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a de-escalation zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a major assault on Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters (linked to Al-Qaeda) “who will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations special envoy, is expected to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee, arguing that the panel &apos; s work should be restricted to &quot; reviewing the articles of the current constitution &quot; and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, he is impeached or disgraced prematurely.
This would certainly be 'the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!'
There are no signs of fatigue among the spectators at the moment.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC have doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million, respectively, during the peak audience hours.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime-time audience, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and &quot; The Rachel Maddow Show &quot; on MSNBC has surpassed cable news channels with 3.5 million viewers for the top-rated nightly news programs.
“It is an odd attraction that we still do not understand,” Neal Baer, the showrunner of “Designated Survivor,” a dramatic ABC series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a Capitol attack, tells me.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell has another theory.
He recalled a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?
"Because it makes me laugh," was the reply Scovell received.
Chaos is always in full swing in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of families of immigrants being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged can afford.
However, the information overloads you when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of “deep background” sources by Bob Woodward for his book “Fear,” the $15,000 ostrich jacket of Paul Manafort (“an ostentatious piece of overkill,” in the words of The Washington Post), and the implications of Stormy Daniels &apos; s lurid descriptions of Trump &apos; s anatomy.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Mario in the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it is in part what makes everything seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he talks about the alternating show of Trump and his daily twists in the plot (whether he is fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can &apos; t afford to miss an episode if you don &apos; t want to fall behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy programmes and people were saying that this was the end of Western civilisation,” Fleiss recalls.
I thought it was a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows into the midterm elections of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the influx of money is coming into the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election to the same seat.
This residential district in Pittsburgh, whose structure was recently redesigned, is represented by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another Republican challenger, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps significantly with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favour of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding war between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later reversed its decision
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight Washington caveat.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization was evicted by the Organization &apos; s management team.
The State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of the American diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US aid in 2017, for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for Central America and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials in the administration made it clear that their intention was that the conference should go ahead, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of the special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which is already well documented in the public record.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating the possibility that Trump's campaign worked in tandem with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable by that chamber, just as he is preparing to run again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditions, and I am not suggesting that Trump's fall is inevitable, or that of his European equivalents.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller &apos; s fate?
Rosenstein has been in a good place since this paper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his unfitness for office.
Rosenstein says that The Times explanation is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
On top of all this, will we vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will find ourselves in a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador &apos; s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles at the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how could I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"We got a good result, Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing we could get something and we ended up with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and we were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already had a good result in the previous game. But with all the support from the crowd, I am sure we can achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be all right.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying themselves immensely and we are having a good training session.
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
The fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people spoke about this with their relatives.
Around half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they talked to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the steps to have that conversation, says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options may be a determining factor in the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversion, as he/she may also be able to help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Their options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help them cover costs or insure themselves with their own savings, as long as they have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Ensure that a medical power of attorney is obtained to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and to ensure that your wishes are carried out in the event that you are unable to communicate.
It can also prepare a notarial power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don &apos; t forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
"It is not just money that is at stake: what doctors do we have to treat?" asks Martin.
What medicines are you taking?
Who will look after the dog?
Everything has to be planned.”
Man shot several times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They shot at a man with a rifle several times as he was walking home after leaving his house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (BST), as a "random act."
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police had appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths expected to rise.
With communications blocked, aid workers have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency covers an area of more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is a lower-level administrative region, had a population estimated at 299,200 persons in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Rim of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is frequently subject to earthquakes.
The following is a summary of some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on 26 December 2004, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of fatalities were reported on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, it did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) was hit by a series of major earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the island &apos; s northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin &apos; s eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a police report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin was placed on pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held without bond, KTUU reported.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "absolutely innocent" when asked to make a statement, the channel reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $25,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a minor Class B offence, with a sentence of one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence complaint and being in possession of a firearm while under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son &apos; s violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communications networks have been cut and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just to the side of the Sulawesi centre, which is located to the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Several videos are circulating on social media showing the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bike path attack in October last year on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injury, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically use in these cases, and one count of motor vehicle vandalism.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to the prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the notice of intent states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal death sentence in New York was carried out in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg twins were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be raised in his hospital room, the police said.
He was acquitted of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma for all involved in these events.
Saipov &apos; s defence team had previously requested the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a Tory protest at conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more by a group of Tories in favour of staying in the EU joining a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers compromise on track, in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and "chaos".
Leave Means Leave MP Chris Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now, he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: 'I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.'
In his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
He dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, where she told reporters: "I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public at large does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: &quot; Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the crowd that the politicians would have to be made to feel the heat if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
It was now a question of trust between the people and their political class, he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat."
We are going to mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the pro-Europeans took to the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards reading "Tories Against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for the security problems they had with the party during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the harmonized border, for free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for running for president
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump &apos; s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
His Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 60th town hall meeting since taking office, using the town hall format.
A staff member asked him whether he intended to stand for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our "irregular government," and that included having a woman at the top.
One arrested for the murder of LSU football player Sims
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interview, Simpson admitted being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98m player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas was able to finish ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team orders from Mercedes would play a key role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of mind by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was first into the pits and let Hamilton run in his slipstream, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strongly on the next lap and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton got past after a wheel-to-wheel move that left the Ferrari driver having to give up the inside line at risk of losing out later on in turn three.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 on that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished seventh in the first race.
He then led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
Finally, he came into the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to regain fourth place from Raikkonen.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman in letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job in securing a perfect match,” said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the Christine Blasey Ford letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia, the President did not directly refer to the testimony offered by Ms. Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were people who were "bad, disgusting and false."
The only thing that could happen and the good thing that was happening in the Senate these last few days was when you saw the anger, when you saw people who were bad, repugnant and false.
When you read the publications and the leaks and then they say "But I didn't do it."
I did not do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember your answer - did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I did not leak it.
Well, wait a minute.
Have we filtered it? No, we have not filtered it,” he added, imitating Senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the leak was first reported in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford &apos; s allegations, I did not leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and, therefore, I did.
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the President, who, during his Saturday night rally, commented as follows: "I will tell you something: that was really bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.
Continuing his defence of the nominee to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don &apos; t care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get the power and the control, &quot; he said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made amends for their Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants on Friday night by winning the return fixture 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead of two goals thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local score before Dwyer restored the Giants lead.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen &apos; s two goals secured the victory.
This was the third defeat in a row for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer &apos; s first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) with an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what could be considered a very lively opening period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to equalize at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized with a goal in the 27:37 mark.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the second half and the victory was secured with the fifth goal of their team as the game entered its final stages.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies so hundreds can escape on the earthquake plane
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after dying in the line of duty to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to rock the area, and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, where the tower was being buffeted by strong winds.
It held its ground to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of victims is expected to continue to rise, as there are still many bodies under the rubble and many people unaccounted for,” Mr. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency &apos; s spokesman, told IRIN.
Tsunami waves up to six metres high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything possible to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country &apos; s military: &quot; I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in the early part of this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that one person is missing after the aircraft accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that since Saturday afternoon, it had been unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local fishing boats were used to assist in rescuing the other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy said that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the aircraft had overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very low.
That was "extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other passengers were able to wade through water up to their waists to the emergency exits of the aircraft as it began to sink.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that sailors working on a pier improvement project also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
The aviation safety network data indicates that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
One analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution finished its arguments in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014 on Saturday.
The United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the mobile phone records to track the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data for several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone records showed that Chambers &apos; mobile phone had been with his phone during the time he said he was with Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if he was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck with Tellis that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before Chambers &apos; death.
The mobile phone records showed that they had only met a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers &apos; death, Tellis deleted Chambers &apos; messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "She was erased from her life."
The defence is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be handed over to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its political roots and away from addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Acts such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a text message she sent was deemed "racist"
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrect text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the claim to a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her shock when she discovered that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” she wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mauritius twice.
After realizing her mistake, a "discomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mauritius received one day &apos; s wages and sent it home on Uber.
Mauritius is now suing the couple for compensation for dismissal with the intention of receiving compensation of $350 per day for the six months &apos; work experience for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them that things don &apos; t happen that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know it &apos; s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that the termination of Maurice &apos; s employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they would not be able to trust him after having offended him.
My wife had sent him something he did not want to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racists, said Joel Plasco to the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone who has been rude to you, even if it was an accident?
To your newborn baby?
Come on!”
Comparing the demand as "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
Are you going to go about it like that?
That is not a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public opinion court has quickly denounced the couple on social networks, criticizing their behaviour and logic.
Paddington Bear publishers feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond &apos; s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: &quot; It was difficult to put oneself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before publication.
It is very amusing to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington Bear.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC page boy before inspiring him to write children &apos; s books, had hoped that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his books had been &quot; bittersweet &quot; after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very quiet man who did not like to boast, he said.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if he had a child who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, though it was not really your achievement.
I think he saw Paddington as a success in that way.
Although he was its creator and its product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
On landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
She said, "I was not called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that it was not expected to succeed."
I then received a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said to him, "Tashi, I love you very much, darling."
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were wearing off slowly and leaving his system.
She had died too soon and everything was going dark.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not scream, cry or shout because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold my ground.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was unfolding.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
I bowed my head and tears were constantly falling.
It is hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.”
Women in Mourning: A Bridge to Suicide Prevention is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Galicia with inspiring messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I do not want any father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any place.
However, he left his work before dying, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler &apos; s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that it could have repercussions."
Davis created the cards &quot; so people know there are people to go to and talk to, even if it is a friend &quot;.
You have to talk about it.
Ms. Humphreys, who is a friend of Davies &apos; s for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
He did not say that he was depressed or anything like that, he tells us.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in their attitude.
Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to overcome it: &quot; It leaves a void in the whole family.
He has left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what he was asking for (a limited time, limited scope investigation), maybe we could bring a little unity to it," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "going off the rails" in the midst of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to proceed?
It is entirely due to the chronology.
There are only five weeks left until the mid-term elections on November 6th. If, as expected, the Republicans have a bad night, their efforts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the land will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President &apos; s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean defector numbers "fall" with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification South, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by traffickers, had been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on this.
Most of the deserters from the north are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and they are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between United States President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea &apos; s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the lack of progress.
Without US confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will never be the first to unilaterally disarm, Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histrionic" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysteric" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made those comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Pelosi said she could not help but think that if a woman had acted in that way, she would have been called hysterical.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny the sexual assault allegations made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking as he spoke of his family and his years of secondary education.
At the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by some disgruntled liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her view, Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
He said he thought he was "disqualifying himself" with those statements and the way he had pursued the Clintons and Democrats.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and the Democrats gained a majority in the House.
Pelosi said, "I will say one thing: If he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he will not be fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court he is on now."
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible judgements by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
This is not the time for an hysterical, impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine, said Pelosi.
And women must take it up.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and she cannot let it go without crying.
We cry when we are angry, said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so strange, do you?"
She continued: &quot; I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was talking: &quot; Perhaps you think I am sad because I am crying.
No, I am not angry.”
And then he just carried on doing what he was doing.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger because they are basically incomprehensible.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once finding myself in tears with an unexpressed rage. A serious older woman, a manager I had always been slightly afraid of, grabbed me by the hair and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
He told me, "Never let them see you cry."
They have no idea that you are angry.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business, which forced him to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea of running herself for the presidency.
"It was not a well-considered decision," he said to me 30 years later, laughing.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they did not need another one.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.”
As the campaign was already well under way, he fell behind in fund-raising, so he was promised that he would not enter the race again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?", he asked.
When she announced that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on capturing voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
"It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
Did he "cry"?
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still much to be done before the battle is over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning in early 2018 by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week was the imposition of new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which will tax half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently imposing tariffs of between 5 and 10 per cent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match the United States &apos; attacks, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon ease up.
To back down would mean to give in to the demands, but to submit to the United States publicly would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the United States &apos; trade war could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a crash landing in the economy in either country is actually much more dangerous than the audience has recognized so far, Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for New American Security focused on Asia, told the audience.
Syria is ready to receive refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been raging for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country &apos; s conditions were improving.
The situation on the ground was today more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an effort to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return to their country of refugees who had to leave it because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still 6 million people living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last victory in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe reclaimed the crown when the Danish team of Thomas Bjorn won the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, threw his ball into the water on the par-3 16th hole, admitting defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari was outstanding in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to ever go 5-0-0 in the current format of the tournament, which began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio García became the European Ryder Cup player with the most wins in history, with 25.5 points in his career.
I do not usually cry, but today I cannot avoid it.
It has been a very hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to win the cup back.
It was a team effort and I am very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now it is the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 on Sunday in a singles match.
I feel incredible pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching this man play golf, said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is an odd statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf all week.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting."
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we spoiled it.
I would like to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Their 12 players played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it is our turn to bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.”
