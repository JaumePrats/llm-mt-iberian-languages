The members of the Welsh Assembly (AM, for its English acronym) are worried about appearing "muppets"
Some members of the Assembly are baffled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for its English acronym).
The confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Welsh Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the whole political spectrum are worried that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party member said that his group was concerned that the party would be left with "two Ps and a W".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member of the Welsh Assembly said that all his group were "disappointed" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the change of name, says: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the National Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which revealed widespread support for calling the National Assembly for Wales to Parliament.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the option MWP obtained the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the Assembly are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, to her knees, as she would have to send the bill for the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will have the final say on how the question should be referred to when they vote on the legislation.
The Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters in Macedonia will decide on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Macedonia of the North".
The popular vote was called to try to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in Harlem
“Historically, the people I’ve spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr Adams.
“There is no longer any distinction between the two.”
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People socialize in a different way now,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods where people go regularly.”
He is concerned that the money raised from the sale of church property will not last as long as the leaders hope and that "in the end, they will return to where they started".
He said churches could be replaced by apartment blocks full of people who would not help the churches that remain in the area.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and, therefore, will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a major black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in 1880.
The white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took over the leadership of St. Martin's, under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were resisting the hiring or promotion of black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building badly damaged and, while the congregation of Father Johnson made plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of the Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly called them "the campaigns of the poor".
In July, the expert who was playing the carillon called it: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church carillon, the largest, 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in the last months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the parish's governing body, wrote to the diocese in July expressing its concern that the diocese was trying to pass the costs on to the parish council, although it had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark attacks 13-year-old boy diving for abalone in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the first day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and friends had been diving for about an hour when they heard the boy calling for help, so they swam over to help him.
Hammel said he initially thought he was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then realized that he was "screaming that he had been bitten."
He had his collarbone broken”, said Hammel when he reached the boy.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in a critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain, Larry Giles, said in a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper chest area.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Cardiff-by-the-Sea to Swami's Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles said there were more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's beauty plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff working in the aisles of their beauty and style departments.
In order to significantly boost the beauty market in the UK, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with a growth rate that is increasing in comparison with the decline in fashion and homeware sales, the largest beauty retailers will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be reserved for televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other stores, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, in the south of London, last week. The second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The rise of online shopping and the trend towards buying small quantities of food in local shops means that supermarkets have to work hard to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will become more like shopping centres as the supermarket chain tries to combat the discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount stores into hundreds of its outlets and introduced several Habitat stores since buying them two years ago. It is thought this has boosted food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over how to divide the profits from the drugstore products in their supermarkets.
The new strategy is being considered after the sale of 281 pharmacy stores of Sainsbury to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a wider range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to make them more appealing to our customers."
We have also invested in a specialist team that will be available to offer advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to meet all needs. On the other hand, an attractive and comfortable environment makes us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, was "furious" after Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the fashion label Truly.
This business had compared with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources consulted, Jones was furious when the girl of gold from television admitted that her new deals, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time for her Truly fashion and accessories brand.
The business had been compared with Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow and was being touted as a favourite to double Willoughby's fortune of around £11 million.
While Willoughby, aged 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go on one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Holly was truly the main priority of Holly."
It was to be her future long-term, which would keep her in the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved totally stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters, ready to be put on sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes, and, possibly, delay its launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on holiday together and Jones has a 40 % stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become the face of Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night "there was no talk of business issues".
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented in his mock-newscaster voice.
“I have not given up anything.”
He said Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump praised the first summit held in June in Singapore, which he said was a big step towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the principal diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an "adequate" response from the United States to its first steps towards denuclearization.
In contrast, he said, the United States continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump's speech was much more optimistic than the one he gave during his rally.
“We get on great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.”
They would have killed millions of people.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the end of missile tests, help to free hostages and bringing back the remains of American soldiers killed in action home.
He also defended his unusual approach to talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but this way, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was reported that foreign NGOs were not needed.
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no emergency was declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” says Mrs Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they still don't know if foreign staff can work on the ground.
The head of the national disaster agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if it was safe for international aid agencies to enter.
Considering that the land in Indonesia is constantly moving, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami sirens in Palu, even though there was a warning in advance, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, travelling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make things even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the country's crumbling infrastructure the central theme of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to road and rail projects.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who is facing re-election next year.
In addition, he must face the persistent tensions of sectarianism in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim community have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, equalises for Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League with a late goal to earn a 1-1 draw at Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot before kicking it to the second post.
The action sent him over the area and towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to parry it with a leap and fell into the net.
“I was trying to get into that position to get on the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I gave him a nudge. I didn’t think about it too much, I just shot.”
Chelsea were winning 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues's right-back made a pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning and making a dribble near the halfway line and entering the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle of the pitch.
After that, he made a lovely pass that took Hazard into the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and scored by shooting the ball into the net with a left-footed kick that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool plays against the Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples (Italy).
On the other hand, Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the country's disaster agency reported at first light on Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and which triggered waves of up to six metres, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster agency.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was covered with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder of a woman stabbed to death
An investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, in Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds in John Street, in the early hours of Saturday morning, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect for murder.
The police have urged people in the area to report anything they have seen or heard.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the area of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
I would also like to recommend to any person, especially taxi drivers, who may have been able to capture something in dashcam footage, as they may have vital information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the body of a woman found is that of a woman from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
Some people who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have informed that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was left speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Now, residents are being told that they will be allowed back in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent telling a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
He keeps repeating "it's terrible".
At 2:00 pm, there were two police vans inside the cordon and another one outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon, monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police on DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, reference 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Oliver Cromwell in the House of Commons becomes the last commemorative success by "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be a poetic act of justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects and sites in England carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestions of Mr Crick as "madness" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's statue from the Palace of Westminster would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As the Sunday Telegraph reported, Mr. Goldsmith said: "Many people consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy."
If it is a completely accurate description, then the debate continues.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has given shape to our later development, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty at the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, as the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pigsty in Xining, in the province of Qinghai (China).
It seems that he travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood on its mouth in the sty.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were badly injured and torn”, said the cousin, who is known by his surname, Wu, to the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it attacking anyone else, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It seems that the family of Yuan and the authorities of the market are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, it is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 pounds cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it away.
After pigs ate a rancher in Oregon in 2012, a rancher in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "disparator".
They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What we need to do is to have the right respect for them.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rain across the south-east of the US.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters off the coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains across the north of Mexico and the southwest of the US in the next few days.
Rosa caused gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, from Sunday morning (Eastern time) and was located about 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressure systems are starting to develop, which are moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will start to push the intense tropical rains northward, towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain hits the low pressure system that is approaching, there will be widespread heavy rain across the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause flash floods in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Forecasters expect between 5 and 10 inches of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in the greater part of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain, it is possible that sudden floods may occur with conditions that rapidly worsen.
Due to the threat of torrential tropical rains, it is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms could cause local dust devils and clouds of local dust.
Low pressure systems approaching will bring heavy rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
Heavy rain could leave up to two inches of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make the roads slippery.
It would be the first heavy rains of the wet season.
Some tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before becoming widespread by Monday afternoon and evening.
Heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and all day Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes will be observed in the USA due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warming of the tropics.
Sometimes, this can mean drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences will be seen in the whole of the US on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will attempt to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures generally in the mid-20s from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates above-average temperatures for the eastern half of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's testimony
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, as they gave their testimonies on Thursday to six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political situation continued to grind to a halt and the media interrupted their normal programming to broadcast the latest news from Friday: a deal designed by the Arizona senator, Jeff Blake, for the FBI to carry out an investigation for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she has absolute certainty that Kavanaugh groped her in high school and tried to take off her clothes at a party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely certain that that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who Nielsen reported on Friday saw it.
The company counted the audience for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels that carried it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has some problems in calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it's a crowd similar to that of a playoff game in American football or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led the cable news pack, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3,1 million, the NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million and the CNN had 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the appearance, there was a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the Republican moderate office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
As he received these criticisms, being broadcast live by CNN, he looked dejected.
“Looking me in the face”, she said.
“Are you telling the truth to the country?”
And he continued: "You have power when there are so many women who don't have it."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at his appearance before the Commission.
The cable and broadcast networks were all broadcasting the hearings live hours later, when the Senate Judiciary Committee had to vote to recommend Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only vote for Kavanaugh if the FBI investigated the allegations against him during the next week, which had been requested by some Democrats.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake took his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British prime minister, Theresa May, has accused her critics of "making politics" with Brexit.
Theresa May, the British prime minister, accused her critics of “playing politics” with the future of Britain and of undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British prime minister, is due to address the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers, saying that a proposal to have Britain and the EU pay the other's tariffs was "totally absurd".
Suspicion of murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Police released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A bail bond of $350,000 has been set, according to the defense.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court released a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the Louisiana State Police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the police for their diligence and search for justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team is "devastated" and "in shock" over the death of Wayde Sims.
“These are the things that always worry people”, said Wade.
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano after it showed signs of activity and emitted 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre registered several tremors and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of vehicles in the Xochimilco district of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 72 km southeast of Mexico City, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the capital in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face separatists in Catalonia before independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after protesters clashed with police during a demonstration by Catalan independence supporters while thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists who had been blocked by the police from marching through the streets threw eggs and powdered paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally full of tourists.
There were also confrontations later in the day and the police used truncheons to quell the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans like "No forget, no forgive", faced off against unionists shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1, 2006 referendum, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the turnout was low, as many people who were against the secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voters from casting ballots at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost all hope that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year was one of our best moments.”
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck.
Despite achieving a narrow victory in regional elections last December, the pro-independence parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in exile or under house arrest, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, who filmed the protest in support of the police on his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
“It's getting more and more tense”, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“To stand for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for driving a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly crashing a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident happened on Thursday evening at around 7:30 p.m. on Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there were damages to the access and the building itself.
At some point, it may have been fired at the car with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
A Livingston promoted impressed Rangers by securing their second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Gary Holt's goal gave Hibs the lead, and they held on to beat Hearts 1-0.
This season, Gerrard's team have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table with eight points' advantage.
Before, Rangers play Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their winning run in the SPL to six games. Manager Kenny Miller has yet to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miler in January.
Livingston misses chances in front of a tough opponent
Holt's team should have gone a step ahead much earlier, causing all sorts of problems for Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence, but missed his shot from in front of goal. Then Alan Lithgow's shot from the edge of the area went wide after Craig Halkett had headed the ball into the goal.
The home team's strategy was to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-retaining play.
That's how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers allowed a Rangers free kick and Livingston looked to find an opening, combining with Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that moment, Rangers were in control of the game, but were unable to break down the hosts' defence and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
This continued until the second half, when Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Allan McGregor, Rangers' goalkeeper, saved a shot from Scott Pittman with a kick, and Lithgow was wide with another Livingston chance.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly being played, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one after a Halkett header on the substitute Glenn Middleton and another after a hand.
“Fenomenal” from Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A fantastic performance and result for Livingston.
The general consensus is that they played a great game that continued to exceed expectations.
His style of play and his squad have hardly changed since his promotion, but this is largely down to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was huge and directed a magnificently organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good times with Gerrard, they were short-lived.
They lacked the ability to materialize the plays, only managing to get into the opposition's half once, which is a warning to Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received a mixed welcome in Colonia
Smiles and a blue sky were in evidence on Saturday 29 September as the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of the Turkish president to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's bid to join the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Colonia to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathisers turned up in the vicinity to see their president.
Opponents of Erdogan also made themselves heard, many of them Kurds, who condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Accident on Deptford High Street: cyclist dies after colliding with a car
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident happened near the junction of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east London, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended to by the paramedics, but died there and then.
The accident happened after a cyclist died after being hit by a car that fled the scene in Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the site of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and it has been advised to drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in disturbances
Six prison officials have been injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the director of the prison.
The disturbances started at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 on Sunday and are still continuing.
A specialist team of elite (called "Tornado") are dealing with the disturbances, which involve eight inmates and affect a wing.
The agents received assistance for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman says: "Specialist staff have been deployed to deal with the incident at Long Lartin prison."
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.
Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire, England, holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had received medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
Last October, a request was made to the police to send officers to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which prisoners attacked the prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid regions could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa cross the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings for the western Arizona, southern Nevada, eastern California and southeastern Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind at the end of the Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix commented in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950."
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of torrential rains, which can reach up to 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
It is likely that between 2 and 5 inches of rain will fall, with the possibility of reaching 10 inches in isolated areas, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rains are considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that part of these torrential rains will be beneficial due to the current drought conditions being experienced in the southwest.
According to the US Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering from extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported by weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula.
Hurricane Rosa, which by Sunday morning will still have a maximum sustained winds of 136 mph, is 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 mph.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
As a result, Mexico is expected to be hit by the intensity of a tropical storm during the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at risk of flooding.
“Heavy rains of between 7 and 15 inches are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 25 inches,” as reported by weather.com.
After that, Rosa will head north towards Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona-Mexico border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression. Later, it will move southwards towards Utah by the end of Tuesday.
“The main danger to Rosa or her remains is the torrential downpours in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest of the US desert.”, says the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will cause sudden and dangerous floods in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Four arrests in Midsomer Norton: attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested as suspects in an attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to the Avon and Somerset Police.
The police have made an appeal to anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and the anger" of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the dirty tricks and shameful tactics of the Democrat Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered "meanness and anger" from the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Senate on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Likewise, Ford testified in the session on this accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, the "Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the bravery" of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with an admirable record of service to the public,” he said to his supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to the Kavanaugh nomination in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“There are five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.”
I'm not running, but I am a candidate.
“That's why I go from place to place fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats are embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction"
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday, according to a senior Republican official at CNN.
Hundreds of victims in a quake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is rising
At least 384 people have died and many more have been swept away by the huge waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in the city of Palu to celebrate a festival when waves of up to six metres high arrived at dusk, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When it was announced yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, in Indonesian), in a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it destroyed everything on land,” said Nugroho. The tsunami had been moving at a speed of 800 km/h across the open sea before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and derailed trains, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The shells continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt by a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT, for its Indonesian acronym) said in a statement that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "serious" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, they found bodies of some victims trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline to the north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were totally paralysed and there was no information coming out of Donggala, said Nugroho.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there”, said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for not warning of the tsunami that had hit Palu, although the authorities say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man can be heard warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In just a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in the area around Palu, making it difficult for rescue workers to coordinate their efforts.
The army started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The airport of the city has been reopened for emergency and rescue operations only, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a visit planned to the evacuation centres on Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
It's very bad.
Although the staff of World Vision in Donggala have arrived safely in Palu, where they are sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating scene on their way, said the Mr Doseba.
“They told me they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
While the aid groups were putting their gears into motion, some people were complaining that the authorities were not allowing the movement of experienced aid workers to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign aid, supplies and personnel can be used in a disaster zone if the area is declared a national disaster.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but that hasn’t happened yet.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people still missing still had hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the stories that write natural disasters.
A child was rescued from a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor for the Indonesian national parapente team, had trained two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the others who were trapped in the hotel Roa Roa, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
“I have my own emotional baggage”, he said.
Mr Gendon remembered how, in the hours that followed the news that the hotel Roa Roa had collapsed in the community of parapente, he had sent desperate messages to competitors at Palu who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a grey verification mark, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren't delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a cash machine raid at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, two thieves robbed a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a cash machine in the centre of entertainment and was preparing to recharge it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for reloading.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspicious people leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved.
Any person with information about the identities of the deceased should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, who is 41 years old, has been known as Ye for some time now, and his eighth album, released in June, is called Ye.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will present his new album, Yandhi.
Ariana Grande was replaced by the singer Nicki Minaj, who had to cancel her performance due to "emotional reasons", as the creator of the show commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious importance for him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, which means ‘you’,” said West in early 2007 while talking about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, means us.
He went from being Kanye, which means 'the only one', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, Jay-Z, has used his name in capital or small letters, with or without a hyphen.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the Mexican president-elect, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that he is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "the army would never be used to repress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, the military fired on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza, killing 300 people at a time when student movements were becoming increasingly strong throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving them monthly subsidies for studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double its funding for I. A.
Now that China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in research in this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional in I. A. who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of several parts of the US government, even though, in general, the US lacks an official I. A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I. A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the U.S.,” says Lee.
The double funding means double the chances of the next great achievement in I. A. being made in the U. S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system that defeated the best American player of Othello. Later, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China office.
Lee praised the previous competitions of the US government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the US, researchers have to work hard to get government funding, said Lee.
“It’s not China that’s taking the leaders of academia; it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent academics from universities to work on I. A.
Lee said that changes in US immigration policy could help intensify US initiatives in I. A.
“I think that doctors in I. A. should have automatic permanent residency cards,” he said.
The Chinese State Council's Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence was presented in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds researchers at academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic sectors.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research on I. A.
Meanwhile, the US federal legislation that was supposed to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name will change to "Republic of Macedonia of the North", a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its bid for EU membership and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on a new name, but the nationalists argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the participation will reach the 50 % minimum required to make the referendum valid.
The referendum ballot paper asked the following question: "Are you in favour of the accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to help Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
“I've come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, aged 79, in Skopie.
Although it will not be legally binding, many members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in the Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared that, at 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, voter turnout was only 16 %, compared with 34 % of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I’ve come to vote for my children, we belong in Europe”, said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in Skopie.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on changing the name of the country that would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents of the campaigners who were boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not by the back door,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.”
If they don't want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
The prime minister says that joining NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, with unemployment at over 20%.
“I think the majority will be in favour, as more than 80 % of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO”, said Zaev after depositing his vote.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Institute of Public Policies said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, which would be lower than the required participation.
A poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57 % of those surveyed planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the participation must be at least 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, evades the whole Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore through the Brighton defence to give Manchester City a 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the middle of the pitch at the start of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking into open space.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He evaded a defender before beating several more in the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch to return the ball to Agüero, who hit it with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan in the goal with a shot that went to the right.
“Agüero has some problems with his foot”, said Pep Guardiola, the City manager, to the press.
“We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.”
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave City the early advantage in the Premier League title race.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very deep in the Brighton territory.
He made a nice pass to the left wing for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave Sterling a few touches before directing him towards the second post.
The Sky blues' striker fired the ball into the net just before going off the pitch.
The City faces the Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the party for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies have at least one wildcard spot locked up thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek their first division title.
“Although we're not playing for anything, at least we can go out there and play with the confidence that the Denver crowd will be into it and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I've faced this year.”
Why wouldn't he want to?
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but it seems they are leaning toward leaving Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who will make his opening day start number 34, had a session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest routine on Sunday.
The history of the Washington ace is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“In November everything we have done is at stake.”
There are five weeks to go until one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I don't present myself, but I am a candidate, so I go from one place to another fighting for great candidates.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it's happening right now."
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you can see the meanness, the wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control. And we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
“We’ve seen it these last four days,” he said, saying that the Democrats were “angry, bad, horrible and false.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, nominating Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, What?
No, no mmm, I'm waiting for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party now encompasses a wide range of opinions.
He is intolerant of people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs who are told we are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in the House of Commons, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment for being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censure motion criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, towards Europe. It is ironic that he was in disagreement with leaders on issues on which he was in disagreement with previous leaders.
As was made clear at the meeting of the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday, "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been like.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more friendly and compassionate" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever really applied.
It is becoming clearer that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged in terms of whether the party leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a similar political vision started to expect him to change his views radically and to adopt positions with which he had never been in agreement, whether on security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
In fact, I am aware that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist abuse, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have such a wide range of opinions and, with each motion for censure or change in the selection rules, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice that recommended that I keep my head down and not make myself heard too much, so that I would be "all right".
But I haven't got into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student at secondary school, I have been motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my secondary school in ruins, and I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, and I certainly didn't in the last elections.
It is impossible that anyone in Nottingham East did not know my political positions and the areas where I disagreed with the current leaders.
All I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday is that I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will stop me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr remain unbeaten
Two late tries may have decided the final outcome, but, without doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Now they lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten that are participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make the most of opportunities, that gave the local team the victory, so the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
“We have been put to the test in all the games and we have remained undefeated, so I have to be happy,”
Robyn Christie, from the Melrose, said: "The Ayr deserve the recognition, they took their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card for captain Rory Hughes, on loan from Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical disadvantage and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Climo extended the lead with a penalty. Earlier, just before half-time, he scored and converted a try, leaving the score at 17-5 in favour of the Ayr.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's conversion, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
After a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, and after the game resumed, Ayr took the lead with a try by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having one more man on the pitch with a try not converted by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
However, the locals recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for pleasing Climo without the ball, from the line of the maul, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
Climo converted the penalty, as he had done almost since the game restarted, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry into the corner for the fifth shot on goal.
The star of Still Game wants to turn his career towards the catering industry
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restaurant business after revealing he has been named director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years is Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC program, who writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper said Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming" Glasgow restaurant business.
“The sea is ours”: a landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the Pacific route
Navy officers watch a naval headquarters in La Paz.
The blue flag waves over public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea is ours by right"
It is a duty to recover it.”
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, people still vividly remember the lost coast to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, as well as the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Bolivia's hopes may be the greatest in decades, as the International Court of Justice is expected to rule on the case on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and calm and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens spread throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in Bolivia's favour and that Chile has the obligation to negotiate for Bolivia to gain sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is locked in a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the tribunal will rule in Bolivia's favour and that the situation would change little if it did.
The UN agency based in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's resolution came only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Chilean expert Paz Zárate.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration”, said Zárate.
He also suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales has undermined any residual goodwill towards Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talking, but it will be extremely difficult to hold conversations after this.
The two countries do not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative to the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will offer Chile "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations" and the chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“This is an opportunity to see what we have to leave behind.”
North Korea says it will not disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never give up its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made at a summit in Singapore between its rivals.
His comments come as Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, appears to be on the verge of re-starting nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, which has been stalled for more than three months after this summit with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.
Ri says that the continuation of sanctions and the opposition of the US to a declaration that ends the Korean War is a "pipe dream".
Washington is wary of accepting North Korea's declaration without some significant disarmament move first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about North Korea's seriousness about giving up its nuclear arsenal, which it probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is expected to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of enormous hats that are about to land in a shop near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large accessories included watermelons with jewels, a witch's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-up lips and reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation recalled a complete scuba diving team, including snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're in luck.
Predicting that the trend for huge hats could soon be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats are coming strong from "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimetres used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The hat's cult following has led to another unlikely fashion item: a giant straw beach bag that was carried by the model in her bikini.
The raffia-woven orange bag, decorated with raffia tassels and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at the Paris Fashion Week.
As fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets this summer. As the designer has had a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories."
John Edward: linguistic competences are fundamental for citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a long history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for its English acronym), strive to deliver the best possible service to students and parents.
Independent schools have as their aim to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy in the world.
As a sector of education that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart."
If you speak to him in his language, you reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries, you can't rely solely on English.
If we look at the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the tables, with the pass rates being highest in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centres that make up the SCIS, showed that 72 % of students got an A in Mandarin, while 72 % of those studying German, 69 % of those studying French and 63 % of those studying Spanish also got an A.
This shows that independent Scottish schools support foreign languages because they are seen as a fundamental competitive advantage that children and young people will need in the future without a doubt.
Today, it is considered that languages are at the same level as the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects in the curriculum of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, of the reasons given by employers on the difficulties they faced in filling jobs, 17 % were attributed to a shortage of linguistic skills.
Therefore, linguistic competences are becoming more and more indispensable for preparing young people for their future careers.
The opportunities for employment that require foreign languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to this competition, which will last their whole life.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from foreign countries will give you an automatic advantage over your competitors.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, the 15%, was French.
This is why it is important to invest in teaching languages to children today.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be better equipped to find a good job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools they can choose between several languages taught by specialist teachers.
The independent schools in Scotland devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children for life, whatever their future may hold.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages still have a vital role to play for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages are "competencies for international communication".
The independent schools in Scotland will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James makes his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans who are waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is still unclear how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48”, Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers' reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that it was likely that James would play for a few minutes.
After a session of training at the start of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason schedule of the Lakers.
“In this stage of my career I don’t need pre-season games to prepare myself,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five rallies Trump has scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking support for the midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which were tense due to sexual misconduct allegations and have left the Senate in limbo for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main aim of these rallies is to help Republicans who are facing the November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, the Trump campaign's five rallies next week are meant to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the campaign”, said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named.
The rally is scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, West Virginia, and could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as having coverage in the Pittsburgh media.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for Senate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come and push him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows it is willing to fight to keep the hope alive heading into the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept, but the players believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So, where do you think the impetus is now?
“We were six points behind and now we’re four points behind, so I guess you could say that’s a little bit of a boost,” said Jordan Spieth after the round.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more in play.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel they have something of a tailwind and plenty of reasons to be optimistic, among other reasons because of the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and earned four points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal off the tee and preaches with example.
The guttural cries of celebration rose in volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt for a draw when they were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave the US the lead in the 15th was greeted with a similar cry, one that conveyed that the US team had not yet been eliminated.
“What we need to do is redouble our efforts and concentrate on the game,” said Spieth.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe have won four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple that did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That run of form and the way he plays with the crowd's energy makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, two different holes at the same time.
However, it is still too early to talk of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball in the morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help to get out of the holes on Sunday.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch because you can see the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team is willing to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good lead going into the final day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods who was in trouble, gaining four points in the Le Golf National classification.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a US team that committed many errors during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but could not close the gap.
The American Jim Furyk needs to obtain eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership served to beat a dejected Woods and a rookie American Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who in the two matches on Saturday had not shone too brightly, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to be Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and number three players respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and tranquil in the southwest of Paris, Europe was not having all its own way.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas served as reference points for the Americans, picking up two points on Saturday.
They achieved an exciting victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has ever recovered from a four-point deficit in the individual matches only twice, although Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a draw to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that mounting a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of it disarming first if it does not have confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of it renouncing its nuclear weapons unilaterally under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" in the past year, including halting nuclear tests and missile launches, dismantling nuclear test sites and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we have not received any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of unilateral disarmament.”
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea about the United States' refusal to accept a "phased" nuclear disarmament formula that rewards Pyongyang for taking steps, his statement is important, because he did not reject a unilateral nuclear disarmament without preconditions, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between a US president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June 2018, when Kim committed to working towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the US has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can be considered to have ended the war.
Washington has resisted calls to soften international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even putting objections to a declaration of termination of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a fantasy of people who don’t know us.”
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.
Ri did not mention any plans for a second Trump-Kim summit, announced with great fanfare by the US president at the United Nations a few weeks ago.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea had been the interested party in the denuclearization of the peninsula, the denuclearization of the peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech to the UN General Assembly, when he said that it was inevitable to direct North Korean missiles towards US soil after President Trump called Kim Jong-un "Rocket Man" on a mission to self-destruction.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said there was still much to do and that sanctions would have to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its advances.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue energetically and without non-compliance until we realize a fully verified and permanent denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions unanimously on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for its missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang in a month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but North Korea later denounced his "demands as those of a gangster".
In a meeting held this month, North Korea agreed to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard University learn how to get enough sleep
Thanks to a new course that is being taught this year at Harvard University, all students are now sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of all-night studying fuelled by caffeine.
A professor discovered that the students at the world's number one university are often unaware of basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
His motivation for setting up the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was just finding out about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever spoken to him about the importance of dreams, which surprised me.
The course, which is being taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only during the week.
The course lasts for an hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sporting performance and the importance of establishing a routine for going to bed.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After that, an icon of the campus with interactive icons animates participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that it won’t change student behaviour immediately.”
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as any has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco”, added the professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride in "staying up all night" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good quality of sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain generate a feeling of hunger, so that it wants to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after having attended one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
I hope that the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
The professor's recommendation is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by computer screens and LED lights, which can alter circadian rhythms, so that they would have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal sinks Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when the attack of Dolly Menga despatched Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Rangers wanted to record their first away win since February's 4-1 victory at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat them for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, who lead the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack came just minutes before half-time and Rangers' lacklustre performance was never going to be enough.
Now, Rangers drop to sixth, Livingston move up to third, behind Hibernian by the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as the referee Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance after apparently being hit by an object from the visiting crowd.
Gerrard changed eight of the eleven players who won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was delighted with the way his Livingston side dominated the Hearts team last week and would have been pleased with the way his organised team put them to the sword.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored at the two-minute mark when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman who passed through the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent it out.
Keaghan Jacobs was penalised for a foul in the deep for the captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only clear the ball out for a throw-in.
The Rangers recovered control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but the referee Steven Thomson turned a deaf ear to the Colombian's request.
Rangers had two goals disallowed in the first half, but the former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and the tame effort of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the Livingston goal scored in the 34th minute was against all the odds, no-one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a deep ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher headed the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed the ball to Menga to score.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an immediate impact, as the striker played a ball to Morelos, but Kelly blocked it.
However, Livingston still managed to get the visitors exactly the type of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing up a long ball after another.
Holt's men could have made more of a break in the final stages, but McGregor stayed firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow rounded off a corner that didn't go in.
The Rangers' substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty in the final minutes of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the “Sunday Morning” newspaper: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and COUNTING... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Singing Hill" with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of scientists cowboys:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium."
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a common protein in many cancers and re-inject it.
A vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein called HER2, and, subsequently, reinjecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer”, such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West embarked on a rant in favour of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often speak to someone white and they ask me how I can like Trump when he’s racist.”
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
Saturday Night Live started the show with a sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in relation to the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded the video of the Kanye West rant to social media.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
He also said to the audience that he had had a hard time on stage because he was wearing that hat.
They messed with me.
They told me not to go out with the hat on.
They got me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see me asleep?" and added that he was "going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to advance?"
Try with love.
His comments received boos from the audience at least twice, and the members of SNL seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died recently.
West surprised many when he came out on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I decide not to reward someone (buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I think is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We also”, he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he was "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
It's not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as P Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also been known as Snoop Lion, without forgetting the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
It is expected that the accused will appear in Belfast Crown Court on Monday.
The police will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, aged 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those roles in film often transmitted to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something has gone wrong and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit Harington, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he thinks it's "quite important" to address the issue.
“Personally, I think it’s quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?”
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?”
Kit believes that television can have some responsibility for the increasing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on television, and in the street, that makes young men feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with the education of the young.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
He recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, I’ve given my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series which won Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm belonging to the family of Leslie, in Scotland.
China reports 14% more new HIV/AIDS cases
China has announced a 14 % increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of these were infected by sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced to a very small extent, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem for the LGTB community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB community suffers much discrimination.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have calculated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data on Republican senators and says the allegations are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters criticized Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had published personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said those accusations were being pushed by right-wing commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies”, said Waters in a tweet on Twitter.
According to the information published, the phone numbers and addresses of the US senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah, were included.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted the information on the Internet during a Senate Judiciary Committee session on the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the posts was associated with Waters' office, and made public the data of a member of Waters' staff, according to the Capitol.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie”, continued Waters.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.”
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a complete lie.
Waters's statement provoked immediate criticism on the Internet, including from the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Deny this information with anger”, wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that the necessary self-control to be a Member of Congress is lacking.”
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
Do not rebel.
The accuser should not be questioned.
He must maintain his calm and serenity.
It seems Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction with the Democrats' reaction to Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during his Thursday testimony.
Republican Omar Navarro, who is running against Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very serious”, he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and the agencies charged with the enforcement of the law" to the allegations.
“We will make sure that the authors are discovered,” he continued, “and that they are considered legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all members of my staff.”
Johnny English: Back in Action. Rowan Atkinson's spoof spy is short of laughs
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new British film. It seems that this is what you should do with this new Johnny English parody action and comedy franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this ironic self-satire about how clearly bonkers we are be the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his licence to make a hash of things for the second time. Just his name gives clues that, more than anything, this is a comedy aimed at non-English speaking territories.
Of course, it's the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions to debauchery, has a little of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that type that touched a single note in the theme of Carros de fuego that touched the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
In addition, the original man on the move was based on the mysterious international traveller and Barclaycard TV advert character of years ago, sowing chaos in his wake.
In this last installment, there are a couple of good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armour while the rotors hit the helmet.
The comic timing of Atkinson is obvious, but the humour is a bit thin and is oddly superfluous, especially now that franchises like James Bond and Mission Impossible add comic elements without problems.
The humour seems more directed at children than adults, and for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as clever and accurate as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of relevance is that Britain is in deep trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the super-secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent in service, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and cornered character who is watching her popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisors tell him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That must be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, though he also teaches clandestine agent skills on the side: there are some good jokes, as it's a spy academy like in School of Rock.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old friend Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married submariner, a role he doesn't exploit enough with Vicki Pepperdine.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of Her Majesty return to action, with the beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a charismatic billionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a fancy French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on a luxury yacht belonging to Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Definitely, they were used to the full in that last sequence, but, however funny and noisy it may be, the whole thing still has a rather childish feel to it.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies it is drawing up a plan to have Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week, but earning five.
The party reportedly wants companies to use the savings from the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to give their workers an extra day off.
So, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "would fit" into the party's economic agenda and would favor the workers.
This change to a four-day week has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way of workers making the most of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: We expect the announcement of a review of the directive before the end of the year.
“We won’t achieve it overnight, but the four-day week is definitely a question that the party wants to incorporate into its economic policy to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in its industrial strategy in general.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support these ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, not all of the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day week is not part of the party's policy and will not be discussed at this time."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was prepared to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "unscrupulous" directors of companies that provide public services.
One of the shadow minister's plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders of water companies will not get back all their investment, as a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond with the irregularities perceived.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive investment funds in which 10 % of shares in private companies would have to be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh on "60 Minutes"
The FBI investigation into the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week the final vote on his confirmation as a judge on the US Supreme Court, and also raises the question of whether the results of the investigation could influence any Republican senator who decides to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
Of course, said Kennedy.
I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out and I asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, determined.
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
He has already made up his mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it tajantely,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she names can confirm it.
36 years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case.
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive line-up of stars in support of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see hundreds of thousands of people travel to Central Park to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be informed about the real objective of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international awareness that hopes to end poverty through the increase of people who actively fight against it.
If you want to receive a free entry to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert-goers have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or any other thing that serves to raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of "clicktivism", which is the term used to describe the way we feel when we think we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favour of a wide range of objectives.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have achieved commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which, at least 10 billion $ have been raised or spent.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based association of investors and implementers united with the common goal of "helping children grow and develop to their full potential". With this aim, they have pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens' collaborators.
Thanks to the support of the British government, the donors, the national governments and the collaborators of Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children with interventions related to nutrition.
In response to one of the frequent questions asked on their website about what can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and hard road, and we will stumble and fall.
But, as they have already achieved previously with the movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the acts we'll have performing at the New York event this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use its Navy to blockade Russian energy exports - Department of Homeland Security
In case necessary, Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the alliance of Russia with Syria, in particular where it operates on behalf of the legitimate government, is no more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the main supplier to Europe.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to guarantee that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market.
Zinke addressed the people who attended a meeting organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the "voice of the consumer energy industry" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia consists, basically, of exploiting and replacing fossil fuels, he said, adding that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to push liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To achieve this, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted throughout that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is another example of unfair competition.
I think we all share the idea that energy cannot be turned into a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said the Russian Energy Minister, Alexander Novak, after meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The US position has found itself, however, with the rejection of Germany, who has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in the EU's energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider the possibility of running for president in 2020, says the Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would study the possibility of running for president after the midterm elections.
During a court appearance in the Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering this challenge.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women among our leaders,” she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.
Warren gave her opinion on President Donald Trump during a hearing at the City Hall and said that "he was taking the country down the wrong path."
“I really worry about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke without hesitation about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from last Friday, Warren said it was "absolutely necessary" that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote.
However, a majority of Warren's own supporters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
A 58% of likely Massachusetts voters said that Senator Kerry should not run for president, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% of those polled supported his candidacy.
In the poll, a majority of respondents supported the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour and 48% against.
Other Democratic Party members spoke about the possible candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder in her son Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation that my son is going through, everything that has happened to him since he came back, they know very well the effects that the TEPT and other wounds have on the families of our soldiers,” said to the crowd that gathered in a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that nobody wants to talk about, and commented on her son and other veterans of war that "they come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and weapons possession under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit against the new US policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for a refugee applicant who is facing the current directive, according to NBC News.
The ACLU has not revealed the full name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" that was filed in August by the ACLU in opposition to the federal policy.
He said his friend "and his children, who are members of a violent gang", abused her, but US officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum requests to the US, as nations facing generalized problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA, for its English initials) that allowed undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence to seek asylum in this country.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made some statements on Friday in which he said the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
According to federal legislation, all asylum requests must be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the individual case and, instead, this exception to the rule infringes that principle.
The lawyers also said in the brief that the policy that denies entry to immigrants hurts the US economy by saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "are a necessary workforce".
The US Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to deny asylum to domestic violence and gang violence victims in June.
The Trump administration has announced a new policy that will allow asylum seekers to apply for protection in the United States if they fear persecution or harm based on their race, religion, nationality or political opinion.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more desperate.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her sick baby in a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for whatever belongings they can salvage.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals have been damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, which has also caused a huge backlog of patients.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuing aftershocks, also very strong.
I couldn't help but cry when he told me about the violent earthquake he was in while staying on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the ruins of the collapsed wall, I think", Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I don't know what's happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're well.
The US ambassador to China accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US midterm elections on November 6, something China denies.
The accusation that Trump launched against Beijing over its alleged attempt to influence the US elections marked a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led to both sides increasing the tariffs on imports from each other.
The compensatory tariffs China applied at the start of the trade war were designed to fall on exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who is one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and business people.
According to Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China is "intensifying that pressure even more with advertisements in our free press."
To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to try to place an ad in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, in the newsstand on the street where we are in Beijing, there are only a few voices of dissent and no reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China can have on the worrying trajectory that their economy is taking, since the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Communist Party of China.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts say that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many Republicans of note are closing ranks behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that it could produce a backlash, especially among women, in the mid-term elections that are being held this year.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have said they want to go ahead with the vote.
“In this kind of thing, you can’t go back,” said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, in an article that was published by The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself in favor of the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm voters who are upset about this issue.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow, or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, protesters who had gathered outside the Senate were chanting "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) as the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is way beyond all expectations", said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
People say that the impact is already very significant, and that is indeed the case.
But it could be even greater, especially among indecisive voters in the suburbs and younger voters, who don't usually vote even though they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he detailed all the allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said it could happen if Republicans continued ahead with the confirmation.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as reported by NBC News last week.
“It’s not just a question of the vote of the committee or the final vote, it’s also about how they’ve handled this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, though there are a few more who are on Kavanaugh's side.
In a new YouGov poll, 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony definitively or probably, while 35% believe Kavanaugh's testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same of Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, who told The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was 17.
On the other hand, Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is putting together a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the technology legend. A company that is based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world."
He said, "It has to be now."
It's a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid technology to allow users to create their own "personal data storage" or a POD.
It can contain lists, lists of tasks pending, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a browser and at the same time.
What is unique about online storage is that the user decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal development through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's director general, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach the whole world.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers included in the payroll that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team is not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce a radical change in their business models where all their business models are going to be completely changed from one day to the next.
We're not going to ask permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate over the neutrality of the Internet.
Even though he is launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee said he was "incredibly optimistic" about the next era of the web.
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only cleric of the Church of England to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years after his death.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a French sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the decoration.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a dense fog and under intense fire from machine guns and artillery".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
The lieutenant colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was a privilege for him to be able to take part in the parade and added that the true value of a genuine hero is shown when he is given such a strong show of support.
The MMA fans stayed up all night for the Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig
Imagine that he stays up all night to watch the whole Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The San José card had 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, the viewers in the UK were left stunned when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a joke gone too far"
There is a government regulation that regulates what can be broadcast from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., so they had to change to the children's programming.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said they will be changing the program to include British viewers in the next editions.
When I think about the option of live transmission, I think it can work.
But it's 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, we received a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise you that it won't happen again.
We'll reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is what we normally do. We tried to give more than usual to the fans, and we were happy with the result.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to the rest of the world because of his sexuality, but this was what motivated him to become a champion.
At 24, he told us that he didn't realise until he got to secondary school that "not everyone was like him".
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in talking about gay rights was to transmit "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to put less importance on winning at the Olympics.
The presenter of this legendary show, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first episode of Laverne & Shirley, Laverne, who was shown as a loner, commented that she felt "inferior" to the rest of the gang during her childhood, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
She said: "I've always felt different and inferior, and that's what has given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to show that he was "something", he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games held in Australia this year to campaign for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he told his story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to transmit that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion boxer said it was a surprise to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, though he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
When you live so much from such a young age (she was 14 when she first competed at the Olympics and her father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "global perspective" had changed.
If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have been about 'I have to win a gold medal'
But you know what, there are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is, without doubt, Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and in fact one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the front row.
He said: "I couldn't tell him I couldn't be in the front row."
She said: "I had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it was only then that I realised he was not invincible."
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in front of my family in the pool at the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This was also the inspiration behind his first choice of song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him during the preparation for the Olympics.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was on the bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad statistic.
Mickelson, who was playing in the event that is held every two years to try to get a record for 12 times, was beaten by the captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the centre of the action, as so often he has been for the United States, the five-time major champion had to content himself with cheering on in some moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to rectify what ails him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best form for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough punishes errant shots.
And, if the field is not sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth match of Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind after the first 12 individual matches, had started in such an impressive fashion, Phil Mickelson's match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, and could say no more.
Furyk said he understood the role he had to play today, he gave me a pat on the back and said he would be ready for tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined playing two games.
We thought there would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them.
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass the record of Nick Faldo for the most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a career that had never been so clearly defined by his individual brand.
Mickelson has won 18, lost 20 and drawn 7, but Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, clever, he likes to mock others; it's great to have him in the team.
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as a support this week; it was fun.
It's more than just a game.
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, even with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end only managed to finish with the other team's heels in their mouths by a minimum margin, winning 14½-13½.
“You can’t help but remember that we won a great tournament at Valderrama; we also won one at Brookline and lost, we won one at Valderrama and won, but by a whisker,” said Bjorn, pictured, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead it by a 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone else that this team is not finished.
You've got to give it everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
We have a target to meet, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on our 12 players, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, not less, that the best players in the world.
Proud of what his players have achieved on a very difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to go too far.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual performances and this is different.
It's great to share what's happening when things are going well, but when you're on your own, you really test your golfing ability.
That's the message that has to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now it's time to leave your partner, go and get the best out of yourself.
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be hoping his players do better individually than they did as a pair, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points from four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the spectrum in the last few days of those great tournaments, and was part of the team that won in Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah".
He remembered every word, when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
We've got 12 super-imports tomorrow, but we've got to play as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all advance in the same direction, the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel like we were going to do something magical tomorrow.
We assigned Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and face off against Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole route.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it won't happen until at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing cost, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that leads the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report in the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the delivery delayed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates that the German Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures, very reduced.
Among other important features, they have longer maintenance periods, so they can be deployed for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the oceans) will be obsolete by the time they start to serve, says Die Zeit.
Last year, the unfortunate F125 frigate was officially rejected by the German Navy, and was returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It has been the first time that a ship has been returned to a shipyard after delivery.
Very little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the class Baden-Wuerttemberg will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors: half the crew that was on the old frigates of the class Bremen.
It was also found that the ship has an excessive weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons is twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the whole project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached €3,100 million (€3,600 million), instead of the initial €2,200 million.
The problems that are being attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction in the power of the German navy.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the navy was "running short of ships capable of deploying".
The official said the problem has been getting worse over time, because the old ships were decommissioned, but no replacements have been bought.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new study, which has been carried out in a Scottish Highlands, is trying to discover how bats use the landscape to find food.
It is hoped that all that is discovered will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelles, as well as the brown long-eared bat of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in strategic locations on the property to monitor the activities of the bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
Experts will analyse the sounds picked up on the recordings to discover the frequency of calls by the bats and which species make them.
Then a report and a map of the habitat will be produced to create a detailed image of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser for NTS, is hoping the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
With this information, the benefits of habitat management can be determined, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be managed to benefit bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
The turbines and the electrical cabling can also pose a risk to them, as well as insecticides and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in achieving their goal.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocalization to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The National Trust, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the subject, who carry out regular surveys, inspections of nests and, on occasion, rescues.
The charity has even opened the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in Scotland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says it is the ideal place for them.
“Here, at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and the right habitat.
However, there are still many things unknown about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop.
It is important to check for bats before carrying out maintenance work on properties, as it is possible to destroy a breeding colony accidentally, killing up to 400 females and their young, which would mean wiping out an entire local population.
Murine bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their colonies.
The Scottish-born head of the Bat Conservation Trust has urged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we know very little about how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has catalogued the rape allegations as "fake news", and says that people "want to get their name in the papers" at his expense.
His lawyers have been instructed to file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying 375 000 $ to keep the incident secret, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already garnered 142 million followers just hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, aged 33, dismissed the report as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false", says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball, looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It's the same old story.
They want to make a name for themselves by just mentioning me, but it's true, I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", he added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appear in what they call "an unacceptable breach of privacy" in the report.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
According to reports, the supposed incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, it is alleged that Ronaldo and Mayorga went to his room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to the documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said that Ronaldo knelt down after the supposed incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and that he had only disappointed him "one percent".
In the documents it is stated that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also says she went to the police and that they took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside of court because she was "terrified of reprisals" and worried about being humiliated in public.
The woman, aged 34, says she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatised by the events.
When the alleged attack took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a great of Italian football, on a contract worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: the UK would regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of its life" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
Mr Clark said we need an agreement.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of Brexit delays at customs could result in the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota's Burnaston factory, said: "My view is that if Britain leaves the EU in March, there will be production problems in our factory."
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears about the impact of Brexit on their business, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are around the problems that could arise in the supply chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is based on the "just in time" method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption at the border, according to the sector, which could cause delays and shortages.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to house the equivalent of a day's worth of inventory in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would have to stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for Brexit was "tuned to perfection to avoid those controls at the border".
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will not only get us through this moment but will allow us to take advantage of the opportunity.
Toyota's evidence is that we have to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a tremendously successful supply chain.
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that, in the long term, the extra costs would reduce competitiveness and, ultimately, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the plant for 24 years and is the Unite union representative there, said his members were becoming increasingly worried: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan which sets out our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be postponed another week, as the dispute over the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, connections between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump might fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus compromise the independence of Mueller, has fuelled the gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein secretly recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone that he himself carried to try to remove the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it.
However, on Monday he was at the White House, where the news was that he was about to resign.
Instead, Trump announced a meeting with Kim (who was then at the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We'll decide as we go along and I'll be informing the press as usual.
Some journalists would dispute that Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the shortage of press passes was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who act grandiloquently, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they fanfaronade."
Next, she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The president holds more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him, he said, while citing without proof: "We have compared those numbers."
Press briefings will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly to the president of the United States, I think that's much better than asking me."
We have tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why he was so popular, where he made an uninhibited and, at times, bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Department of Health in Scotland writes to NHS workers in Scotland about their fears over Brexit
The Scottish Government has written to the staff of the EU office in Scotland working for the HHS to express their gratitude and their wish to continue working with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens working in non-central government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on the expected exit decisions, which were expected to be taken this autumn.
However, the British government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know this must be very confusing for you.
And that is why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue counting on you.
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head wound
Christion Abercrombie, a player for the Tennessee State Tigers was operated on in an emergency after suffering a head injury on Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennesse.
The coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the press that the injury occurred just before the break.
“He came to the band and collapsed there and then,” said Reed.
Both the coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touchline before carrying him off on a stretcher and examining him in depth.
A member of the Tennessee State staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with a total of 18 for the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to provide shelter for the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The change will neutralize the success Corbyn has achieved in attracting younger voters
The increase in the land transfer tax will apply to those who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year which will be used to help the homeless.
The additional money raised by the increase in stamp duty on foreign buyers of UK property will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to target those with higher incomes.
The increase in the land tax will be levied on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to encourage the government's policy to combat begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current communications tax, also includes the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, which could reach up to 3 %.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which is causing prices to rise and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder.
Many of the country's wealthier areas (especially the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping property prices very high by buying up land without any intention of using it, and urged the Sra. May to abolish the stamp duty that is applied to affordable homes to solve the "shameful problem of housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, including rent controls and the end of no-fault evictions.
It also proposes giving local authorities more powers to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the streets is still too real.
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland manager says his "primary objective" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited at the prospect of reviving the north-east club, which currently occupies third place in the League One (the third division of English football), three points behind the leader.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only managed to get a B hat", he told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and that's always made me want to go back.
That opportunity will only become reality, however, if I can lead a club to success.
Among the predecessors of Ross as manager of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he moved to a club as big as Celtic, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, for me, success is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League,”
because the structure and facilities of this club correspond to those of the Premier League", he said.
“It’s not easy to achieve, but I would only consider that I had achieved my objective here when I could return the club to where it belongs.”
Ross has only been a manager for three years, after being an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell as technical director at Hearts.
After helping Alloa Athletic to recover from relegation to the third division, he helped St. Mirren to avoid relegation the following season and win the championship.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled his time at Alloa as "a real crossroads"
I always thought that directing was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It sounds strange, but it was good, I could make a living from it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that job; however, I feel good in the direction.
I always wanted to train and now I have achieved it, it is the time of my adult life when I have felt better, without a doubt.

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 on a Saturday afternoon.
The heatwave of summer has boosted profits at British pubs, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy firm CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have meant that in July the pattern of the previous month of June has been maintained, with pubs increasing their takings by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8% fall in the activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that serve mainly alcoholic drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where profits were down.
Pub food suffered less than restaurant food, although not as badly as restaurant operators.
It seems that people only want to go out to drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of drinks rose by 6.6% during the month, while sales of meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Events of social or sporting importance are still the most important factors in terms of sales of activities outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8% fall in sales compared with last year is going to be especially painful given the continuing pressures on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the restaurant operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, rose 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in the number of new brands.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK's pub, bar and restaurant sector, data is collected and analysed from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion.
One in five children have secret accounts on social networks, which their parents are unaware of.
One in five children (some even as young as 11) have secret accounts on social networks that their parents and teachers don't know about, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a growth in the number of fake Instagram pages
The news has sharpened fears that the government will publish sexual content
20% of students said they had a "main" account that shows their parents
One in five children (some even as young as 11) create secret social networking accounts that hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news has sharpened fears that sexually explicit material will be published.
20% of the students said they had a "main" account that their parents could see, while also having other private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website saw how a teenage boy was encouraging others to "violate" her.
A study by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and field and his president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want to see sport benefit from his great international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from her involvement in the sport,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help to develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, suffered a transient ischaemic attack that left him temporarily unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or how much.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I had to learn to walk again and I'm now doing agility exercises.
Thanks for the messages and words of encouragement!
The announcement of a breast pump that compares mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A breast-milk-extracting company has divided opinion on the Internet with an advert that compares mothers who breastfeed with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is supposed to be the "world's first silent breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music, showing mothers talking about the freedom they feel with the new breast pump.
Four real women dance in a hayloft full of hay, with cows, with signs like: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues to say: "Feed them, feed them, I am feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I am feeding my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say that it puts the focus on the horrors of the dairy industry.
A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
As with us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after giving birth.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly fitted into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby."
But, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a crazy advert."
However, other people defended the advert, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "destructive".
I think that's a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but I don't give it any more thought.
It's a great product”, said a woman.
Another person told us: "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows."
In the ad, no praise or criticism of the dairy sector is made.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreetly placed bombs inside their brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who express milk with a pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the bra of a breastfeeding mother, which makes it possible for her to move around, hold her baby and even go out with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, creative director and ECD at Mother, comments: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch."
By showing the parallel between expressive women and cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minors secretly sent to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied minors detained has increased significantly, despite the monthly influx of migrants to the border remaining at near-normal levels. In part, this is due to the harsh rhetoric and the policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are making it more difficult to sponsor these children.
Traditionally, the majority of godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take in a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal records.
Around 80% of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we are still pursuing these people,” said Albence.
In their haste to process minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a maximum of one month from the date of arrest, instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to workers at the reception centers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before a judge in immigration cases.
Those who are not considered eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reports from the workers at the centres and the system reports that have emerged in the last few months, the longer they are held in detention, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could provoke violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
As the defenders point out, these concerns are even more acute in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of distress in these children will be overlooked.
In addition, the move to the camp without having given them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma, which many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "occupying forces" of the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the vice-prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue would be "dealt with accordingly".
“They must withdraw immediately and without conditions,” he said.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism" in Syria was practically over, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight "this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorists and any foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-ravaged country.
On the topic of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "seeding irrational fears" that made them decide to stay outside the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a "de-escalation zone" in Idlib province, the last major rebel bastion, has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a major assault on Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), which will be "eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN's special envoy, is expected to call soon for the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a new constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for Syrian participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will expect, he is impeached or resigns prematurely.
This would surely be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!
There are no signs of fatigue in the audience at the moment.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC have more than doubled to 1.05 million and 1.6 million respectively during prime time.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime-time audience, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has surpassed the ratings of cable news channels with 3.5 million viewers for its main news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t understand,” Neal Baer, the show’s executive producer, tells us. “Designated Survivor” is a drama about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?
“Because it makes me laugh”, was the reply Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of families of immigrants being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information overloads you when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources that Woodward used for his book "Fear", the $15,000 ostrich jacket of Paul Manafort ("a source of pride that is out of proportion", in the words of The Washington Post), and the implications of Stormy Daniels's scabrous descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never look at Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, that’s what makes it seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when we talk about the rotating cast of Trump and his daily plot twists (whether it’s fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to get left behind.
When I spoke to the Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't tear himself away from the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when in those days we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss tells me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.”

Foreign money flows into mid-term elections for the most tightly contested House of Representatives seat
It is no surprise that the influx of money is coming to the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the reorganization of a congressional district with two candidates seeking reelection to the same seat.
Pittsburgh's residential district of Squirrel Hill, which was recently redesigned, has a Democratic representative, Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another Republican challenger, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a battle for funding between the main financial backers of the parties' campaigns, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rebuff from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the hotel was evicted by the Trump Organization.
The State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, the development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for Central America and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by the middle of September, high-ranking officials in the administration made clear that their intention was that the conference go ahead, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three US envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new threats or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman rejected to comment on the details of the debate described by three US diplomats, including two career diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of the special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there are already many public indications.
It is thought that Mueller is also investigating the possibility that the Trump campaign worked in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable by that chamber, just as he prepares to run for a second term, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional sentences, and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his European equivalents.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, the German army was ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world turns on these points of inflexion, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans now face several of these points of inflexion.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good place since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to do the job.
Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation the F.B.I. has requested into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?”
In addition to all this, will we vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Trump to account?
If we fail these exams, we will be in for a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we won't fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that had once occupied my ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that heritage, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We got a good point, because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We started the game believing we could get something and we came away with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but, in general, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
We were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and were the better team.
This Thursday we'll have another great European night.
I hope we can get the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the previous game. But, with all the support from the crowd, I'm sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be OK.
The team is doing well, the boys are enjoying themselves a lot and we are having a good training session.
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.
The fear of saving for retirement is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their families.
Around half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they had talked to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this.
“People want me to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare your family to care for you if you don't express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to get care, because that can be a factor in the cost.
He also incorporated his financial advisor into the conversion, as he can also help him find a way to pay for those expenses.
His options for long-term care financing include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover his expenses, or saving the money himself.
Negotiate his legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Make sure you have a power of attorney for health care to designate a person to supervise your health care and to make sure that the professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
It can also prepare a power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to take financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
“It’s not just about money: what doctors do you have to treat?” asks Martin.
“What medicines is he taking?”
Who will look after the dog?
You have to have everything planned.
They shoot a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They have shot a man with a rifle as he walked home after leaving the pub.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was found in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which happened around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have made an appeal for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said. It is expected that the death toll will rise.
With communications blocked, the aid workers have been unable to get any information from the regency of Donggala, a northern area of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The Regency, which is a hierarchical administrative region inferior to the province, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
The towns of Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of great seismic activity, and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Following this, we summarize some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh in the northern Sumatra island of Indonesia, on December 26, 2004, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and beginning of April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake devastated the southern tip of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with almost 700 fatalities.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 tsunami and earthquake.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Lombok, an Indonesian tourist island, was hit by a series of earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a police report published Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away.
Palin has been ordered to remain in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held without bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked to make a statement, according to the channel.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a lesser Class B offence, with a sentence of one day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
Sarah Palin called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska veterans' court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence complaint, and possessing a firearm while intoxicated, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that she punched him in the face.
Several veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking the violent behavior of her son to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a quake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communications networks have collapsed and it is expected that the death toll will rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just to the side of the centre of Sulawesi, which lies to the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived at the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in the New York City subway bombing
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October 2017 attack on a bike path in the West Side of Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injuries, according to the warning of the intention to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of a criminal enterprise, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of destruction of a motor vehicle.
The attack required "a substantial amount of planning and premeditation", according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, the warning notice states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York processed a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal execution in New York was that of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This couple was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked that the flag of ISIS be flown in his hospital room, said police.
He has been found not guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a life sentence without the possibility of parole will prolong the trauma for all those involved in these events,” said Patton.
The defence team for Saipov had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have left the EU by now if Nigel Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Theresa May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more when a group of Tories in favour of remaining in the EU joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers plan for Brexit on its feet amid attacks from Brexiteers, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and "chaos".
The Leave Means Leave MP said at the rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile."
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: "Just one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people."
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said that if the politicians were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they would feel the heat.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class feel the heat."
“We are going to mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent United Kingdom, proud and self-governing.”
Meanwhile, the supporters of the stay campaign marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards against the Tories after the group's presentation this weekend.
The Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the problems they had with an application for the party during the opening of the conference.
“These are the same people who tell us they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit”, he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider all options for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been a lot of speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday was his 30th meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
A reporter asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.
A suspect in the shooting death of LSU football player Tyrone Sims
The Baton Rouge police department announced this Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had already published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man seen in the video.
Sims, aged 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University at first light on Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death,” said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde was defending a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 1.98 m tall player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Bottas qualified ahead of Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the team orders from Mercedes would be important in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton out of the race by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to enter the pits and let Hamilton run in the back of the group, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes came out with a strong burst of speed a lap later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton got ahead after a wheel-to-wheel move that made the Ferrari driver have to give up the inside line at risk of being overtaken after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first race.
After leading much of the race, he clung to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered the pits on lap 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to recover the fourth position.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman in letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple
That's a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia Western, the president did not directly refer to the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are "bad, repulsive and false people".
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false,” he said.
“When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say “But I didn't do it.”
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Did you leak it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it.
Well, give me a minute.
Have we filtered it? No, we haven't filtered it,” he added while imitating the senator.
A letter sent to Feinstein in July by Ford's lawyers detailed the allegations against Kavanaugh, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and, therefore, I did.”
But his refusal to shake hands did not seem to sit well with the president, who during his Saturday night speech commented as follows: "I'll tell you something: that was a really bad body language."
Perhaps he didn't, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get power and control”, said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made amends for their Friday defeat in the Elite League by beating Belfast Giants 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead with goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the game before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third defeat in a row for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, of which the Giants won the previous three.
The first goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what could be considered an early period of lively play, Sullivan returned to the ice with a desire to play in the 13:10 mark before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to tie the game in the 15:16 mark.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the second half and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as the game approached the final whistle.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
A traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape in the plane after the earthquake
A controller of air traffic in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to batter the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his friends fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, aged 21, refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu. The tower was being affected by a strong swaying.
He remained firm to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
He jumped from the control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this”, he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims will continue to rise, as there were many bodies under the rubble and we have not been able to contact many people,” says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Tsunami waves up to six metres high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute comes an ambulance with more bodies."
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as many survivors as possible, but we don't know what we will find there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the army of the country: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
CNN reported that the President was ready.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok at the start of this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man has disappeared after an air crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared, after saying that all 47 passengers and the crew had escaped safely from the plane as it sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening it had been unable to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in a stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The US airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
“That’s really good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes comments that he and other travellers were able to advance through water that reached their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said that passengers on board were screaming and panicking, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said the sailors who were working on a nearby pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the air traffic control network indicates that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A forensic analyst presents the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up its arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The Justice Department's analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He showed the jury how he used the phone records to tie the movements of Quinton Tellis, the accused, and Jessica Chambers, the victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting earlier statements by Tellis, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Chambers's mobile phone had been with Sanford during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers' phone.
“He wiped her from his life,” said Hale.
The defence has scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be over that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that hip hop has moved away from its original messages of political activism and social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her after she sent them a text message that was "racist"
A New York nanny is suing a couple for racial discrimination after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple deny that it is racist and compare the demand with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her consternation at discovering that the new childminder, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON”, wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "discomfited" Plasco-Flaxman fired his "awful" black nanny, who was replaced by a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received his daily wage and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for a compensation payment of $350 a day for the six months she worked as an intern without a contract.
“I want to show them that things don’t happen like that,” he told The Post on Friday, and added, “I know this is a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they could not trust him after having offended him.
“My wife had sent him something he didn't want to say.”
She's not racist.
We're not racist,” said Joel Plasco to the Post.
“Would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?”
To your newborn?
“Come on!”
Comparing the demand as "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to go for someone like that?”
That's not very decent”, said the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public opinion has been quick to condemn the couple on social networks, criticising them for their behaviour and their logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who was reading it for the first time before publication."
It's very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.
After saying that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the children's book, had expected his work to be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agridulce" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very quiet man and didn't like to boast.
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you were proud of him, though it wasn't really your achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although he was its creation and product of his own imagination, he always gave credit to his own Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
When he landed, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“She would call regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that she didn’t think she would make it,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“After that I got a call from Nad to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.”
And so I did.
I said to him: "Tashi, I love you very much."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were running out and his system was shutting down.
She had died too soon and everything was going out.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep my nerve.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was about to go through.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I bent my head and the tears were falling all the time.”
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.”
They always said that her smile lit up any place.
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's younger brother found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I worry about it constantly."
Davis created the cards "so that people know there are people to turn to and people to talk to, even if they are friends.
Don't keep it to yourself, you have to talk about it.
The late Mrs. Humphreys, who was a friend of Davies for many years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been living for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or anything like that,” she says.
“Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.”
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to get over it: "It leaves a big hole in the family."
He left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited investigation in time, a limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going off the rails” in the middle of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
His refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
There are just five weeks to go until the mid-term elections on November 6. If, as is expected, the Republicans have a bad result, their attempts to elect the man they want for the Supreme Court will be badly weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling on senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary to the President.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of deserters from North Korea "fall" with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by human traffickers, have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment on the matter.
Most of the deserters from the north eventually receive citizenship in the south.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers desertion to be illegal immigration and, in many cases, repatriates desertors.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on the negotiations for nuclear disarmament.
This followed the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the lack of progress on US sanctions.
“Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histrionic" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said that the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was a "histrionic" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted like that, they would have said she was hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking while speaking of his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also condemned explicitly the Democrats, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by some liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed his partiality against Democrats.
“I think he’s doing himself a disservice with those statements and the way he’s pursued the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi put her objections when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed in the case and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
“I’m going to say one thing: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not going to be fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he’s not going to be fit to be on the court he’s on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible rulings of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, which is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time for a hysterical person and an impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine,” Pelosi said.
And women have to pick it up.
It's a justified rant, months and years of fury spilling out, and she can't let it go without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
“I don't think that's so strange, do you?”
She continued speaking: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company, and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to: "Maybe you think I'm crying because I'm sad."
No, I'm not angry.
And then he was still doing what he was doing.
I thought it was great.
Crying is allowed as a way of letting off steam in part because it is not really understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once when I found myself crying with an unexpressed rage. An older woman, a serious manager with whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a staircase.
“Never let them see you cry”, he said.
They have no idea you're furious.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they've cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board a boat called Monkey Business, she had to withdraw from the presidential race. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-considered decision,” he said, laughing, 30 years later.
“We already had seven candidates in the race and we didn't need another one.”
Someone once referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the campaign was already well advanced, he stayed behind in the fundraising, so he promised that he would not run again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost cause.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?”, he wondered.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration at a system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on capturing delegates rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
“It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown,” said Schroeder, recalling the reaction of the press.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.”
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
“Did he cry?”
The trade war between the US and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although there is still much to be fought, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning to China in early 2018 by imposing tariffs on its main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs that affect $200 billion (£150 billion) in goods, which will add taxes to half of the goods that enter the US from China.
In all cases, Beijing has responded in kind, applying tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match the US attacks, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon back down.
To back down would mean giving in to Washington's demands, but to submit to the US publicly would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the trade war with the US could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could make the difference between a soft landing or a hard landing for the economy in either country is something that has been overlooked until now,” said Abigail Grace, associate fellow at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to welcome back refugees, says the foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to take back refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, the Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground is today more stable and safer thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is still trying to restore the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to try to restore normality.
All the conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their means of livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
There are still six million people in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help to rebuild the country.

The European team has won the Ryder Cup of 2018 by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last victory in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe reclaimed the Ryder Cup when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team won 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, admitted defeat by throwing his ball into the water on the par 3 16th hole, conceding defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Francesco Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to have ever achieved a 5-0-0 in the current format of the tournament since it began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen, 5 and 4.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran Spaniard Sergio García, who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most wins in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.”
It's been a hard year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have been able to win the cup.
It's a team effort and I'm very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now it's Rahm's turn to carry the torch, having beaten the legendary American Tiger Woods by two and one in a match play duel on Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride at having beaten Tiger Woods, because I have grown up watching this man,” said the 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his career in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, leaving him only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The US team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they never gave up."
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we messed it up.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Their 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now it's our turn to bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.”
