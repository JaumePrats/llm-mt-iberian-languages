El aguijón de acero flota sobre el agua debido a la tensión superficial.
La superficie del agua se mantiene unida a causa de la atracción entre las moléculas de agua que están en la superficie del agua y las moléculas de aire que están por encima de ellas.
El agua forma una piel invisible sobre la superficie del agua que permite que las agujas floten sobre la superficie del agua.
The blade on a modern ice skate has a double edge with a concave hollow between them. The two edges allow for a better grasp of the ice, even when tilted.
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, as the blade tilts to one side or the other, the edge which is in contact with the ice also curves.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns left.
Para volver a su nivel energético anterior, deben deshacerse del exceso de energía que recibieron de la luz.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a "photon".
The light from the laser is a type of radiation called "electromagnetic radiation."
The next picture shows the atoms emitting photons. Of course, in reality photons are a lot smaller than those in the picture.
Las fotones son tan pequeños como la materia que compone los átomos

There are many theories to how Sanskrit came into existence. One of them is about an Aryan migration from the west into India who brought their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of Upanishads, Sanskrit just faded due to hierarchy.

Con la batalla por Francia sobre, Alemania comenzó a prepararse para invadir la isla de Inglaterra.
Germany
The Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (“Kriegsmarine”) and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attack.
Let's start with an explanation about Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although they had just built four new ships right before the beginning of the war.
Italy's main goals were African countries. To capture those countries, they would need to have a troop launching pad, so as troops could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides those actions, Italy's battleships were not supposed to do anything else.
Now for Japan. Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
Los submarinos son barcos diseñados para viajar bajo el agua, y permanecer allí durante un período prolongado de tiempo.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. Back then they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range.
In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen.
The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines.
Por su éxito con submarinos, después de la guerra los alemanes no son confiables para tener muchos de ellos.

Another famous Greek is a mathematician Pythagoras, mostly known for his famous theorem about relations of the sides of right triangles.
There are varying estimates for how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether or not very closely related dialects are counted.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and as many as 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but different in script; in everyday conversations, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under great cultural influence of Germany.

Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive classes (storyboarding, audio and video editing, story telling, etc.)
Interactive design requires that you re-assess your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear ways.
Interactive design requires that components of a project connect to each other, but also make sense as a separate entity.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than for prime lenses.
This is becoming less of an issue as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
This has allowed zoom lenses to produce pictures of a quality comparable to that achieved by lenses with fixed focal length.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes inexpensive zoom lenses hard to use in low-light conditions without a flash.

For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people, who hunted giant birds called moas.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a Great Fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.

There was also another tribe on the Chatham islands these were Maori who migrated away from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori there were a few skirmishes and in the end, the Moriori were wiped out

The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to have access to information at all times.
Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of day and expect reasonably quick responses, rather than waiting until the next face-to-face meeting.
The postmodern approach to learning offers the freedom from absolutes. There is no one good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one good thing to learn.Learning takes place in the experience between the learner and the knowledge presented.
Our current experience with all the do-it-yourself and information presenting, learning-based television shows illustrates this point.
So many of us find ourselves watching a television show that informs us of a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.
We will never overhaul a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to examine ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbour's house.

Some hotels have a heritage from the golden age of steam railways and ocean liners; before the Second World War, in the 19th or early 20th centuries.
These hotels were where the rich and the famous of the day would stay, and often had fine dining and nightlife.

The app is available for Android and iOS devices.
