The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but more like a roar of a lion.
Cats like to eat small animals. If they can, they hunt mice, snakes, scorpions and rats. All animals that hunt are small.
The scientists believe that the ocelots follow and hunt the animals that are most abundant (prey) in the area, using the tracks they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark, and they can also see very well at night. The ocelots hunt their prey very silently. They hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the environment, and then they attack their prey.
When a small group of people (a small population) separate from the main group (for example, by creating a forest or a river, or by emigrating to a new island and not being able to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations different from those needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not canvied people nor mice, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to seem more and more like the other population.
Finally, after thousands of years and millions of years, the two populations were so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This is a new species, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
The plants produce the oxygen that we breathe and take the carbon dioxide that we exhale (that is, we exhale it).
Plants make their food from the soil using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and animal skins. The majority of what we build is made of plants. Without plants, most animals would not survive.

And that the majority of their food was familiar to them, the Romans had some rare products or unusual dishes at their banquets; such as swans, peacocks and partridges, and some dishes called lirons.
Another difference was that, while the poor people and the gifts were distributed in a common place, the men enjoyed the banquet and the women had to work while men enjoyed.
The antics of the Romans and Greeks could not have been included in the foods that have arrived from Europe and Asia in the post-Roman and Asian ages.

Only in the last two weeks, the United States and the free world have liberated France and Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who work and live together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civitas", which means "civil", and "civis", which means "citizen". It also defines the dimensions of the society.
The city-states precede the nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural endeavour and a fair distribution.
The minorities' cultures sometimes disappear without leaving any traces of their history and without being recognized as a civilization.
During the War of Independence, the three states formed a weak central government, which the Congress declared to be the only legitimate component of the Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and, since there was no executive authority to enforce them, the taxes were often not collected, and the authorities of the state, which were often poor, were unable to enforce them.
The Catalan government did not have the authority to invalidate the laws and regulations on taxes and the rights of the states.
The Articles must be approved unanimously by all the states before they can be put into effect and the states will take the liberty of not attending so often.

For example, the most common format of film is 35 mm, which was the standard size of film during the era of the analog film.
It is produced today, but it is still more important: the relationship between the aspect and the sensors of the digital cameras has changed.
The 35 mm format creates, of course, a little confusion, with 36 mm of extension and 24 mm of height.
It is true that the relation of aspect of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the relation of numbers with more simple names) is, for the moment, of 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to this aspect.
The rule of thirds, which has been used widely and often ridiculed, is a guideline that creates dynamism and order in an image.
The most efficient place for the subject is in the intersection between the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example).
During this period the history of Europe is going to pose the question of the Catholic Church, which has been rich and powerful.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united the European states, despite the differences in language and customs.
His power is omnipresent, affecting everyone, from kings to plebeians.
One of the principal principles of Christianity is that the riches should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources should exist precisely for this purpose.
The authority of the Church in Rome has been in place for more than a thousand years and this gathering of power and money will cause many people to ask if this dogma is being complied with.
After the beginning of the hostilities, Brittany began a naval blockade of Germany.

The Ancient Xina had a unique way of showing different historical periods: each era of the Xina or each family in power was a dynasty.
There were also periods of instability in the dynasties, as the Han and Jin dynasties were divided. The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods there were fierce wars between many noblemen who fought for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most bloody periods of the ancient China, thousands of people were killed while fighting for the throne in the Great Hall of the Han.

Determinism is a term that is used in practice by a large number of ideas, from the technological imperative or the imperative technological to a strict sense that the human being is guided by a hidden logic that is associated with the scientific laws and the manifestation of technology.
The majority of the interpretations of the technological determinism share two general ideas: that the technological development follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "side effects" on societies that are inherent, in place of being socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the costs of the motor are necessary for the development of the roads.
The Catalan government has announced that it will be introducing a new system of "carreteres" (car-sharing) in the country. This will allow people to share cars and reduce the cost of owning a car.
The possession of large amounts of coins also leads to a greater incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged coins.

As such, Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in the feudal Europe.
His fame as an epicentre of luxury is going to start in the year 400 BC and will last until approximately the year 1100 BC.
His status will be diminished during the 12th century, especially because the Croats had returned to the city and brought with them more valuable goods than those offered by the Byzantines.
It will be in this moment when the title of capital of fashion will go from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style will be the most popular style in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture.

The subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas so that they can feel a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
The qualities that determine a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of the factors.
The members of a subculture sometimes distinguish themselves from other subcultures by the distinctive use of style, fashion and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to recount the few cases of unfortunate infants who will not be socialized by adults because of neglect, misfortune, or abuse.
These children are called "salvages" or "ferals". Some of them have been adopted by people (usually their peers); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the difficulty of the parents to cope with the intellectual or physical disability of the child.
The children saved from maltreatment can suffer from post-traumatic stress or even run away before they are abandoned or flee.
Other animals have been created by God; some of them are still alive today.
The infant saviour, which is created only for animals, presents behaviours (always within physical limits) similar to those of the animal that it cares for, such as the mother or the father.
Although the learning based on projects would be easier and more interesting, the bastida would be one step closer.
The theory of the bastida is not a method of learning, but an aid that provides the individual with a new experience of learning, as when they learn to use a new software or start a new project.
Bastides can be virtual or real: in another way, a professor is a virtual bastide, but also he is the little clip assistant of Microsoft Office.
The virtual bastides are internalized in the program and are thought to question, show and explain procedures that have been very complicated to study students because they have been totally isolated.
The children are given in different ways, from abandonment to abuse, passing through extortion.
I would not have been able to grow up in an environment that was not nourished, educated and respected, but I have done it.

The Internet combines elements of mass communication with interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet bring about additional dimensions in terms of the focus of use and gratification.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The personal implication and "relations in the course" are also identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when investigating the reaction of the public to web sites.

I suggest that these capacities for interpreting the human behavior could be shared by animals like dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: domesticated and wild.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection eliminates the combination of the genetic variation that expresses itself.
The segregation and recombination combine the variation within and between the two genetic pools in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human digestive system to satisfy its needs for amino acids with the resources available in the vegetation.
But, in the end, it will be worse: economic decline, malnutrition and finally death.
The easiest way to get proteins is from plants, but they have to be cooked, because they are difficult to digest for humans.
In the change, the food of animal origin (bees, ants, termites) will not be digested easily, but will provide a great quantity of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Despite this, we will not be surprised if the new government will solve the "protein problem" as they did today with the ximpanzés of the savannah.
The interruption of the sound is the process of waking up at the end of the normal period of sound and then falling asleep again for a period of time (10 - 60 minutes).
It's easy to use a clock that wakes you up without waking you up completely.
If you are from the ones who restart the router while sleeping, try to put it at the other end of the room, so that you can turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythms include drinking a lot of liquids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, so that one has to wake up to urinate.
The quantity of inner poor that a person possesses is correlated in an inverse way to the quantity of tension in body and spirit of a same.
The lower the pressure, the higher the tension, the greater the force of life. Each person has the potential to find peace and satisfaction.
I'm going to arrive at the illumination. The only thing that stands in the way of this path is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is spreading by the way of love of Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of the kundaliní yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With the Kundalini Yoga, the energy Kundalini is awakened (illuminated) by means of postures of yoga, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the state of being. By visualizing various states, the channels of energy are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Catalonia was the enemy of the Second World War, which will facilitate the collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice will come the system of systems, processes and cultures, and all two countries will be enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies and the enemies were at peace.
It will prolong the forty years and it will continue to be a war, with exercises delegated, in camps of battle of Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the bridge of Romanès.
These plans will become obsolete tonight, when more than 800,000 Soviet troops of the Red Army of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will enter and create the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Pact of Non-Aggression between the Soviet Union and Poland and other international, bilateral or multilateral treaties.
To use ships to transport merchandise and, with some difference, the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and merchandise across the oceans.
The traditional role of the marines has been to ensure that your country can maintain its capacity to wage war and to protect its people and its goods, while at the same time interfering with the capacity of your enemy to wage war and to protect its people and its goods.
One of the recent examples that are more relevant is the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War. The Americans are trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the moment, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have conquered Great Britain, just as it has conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats are being domesticated for the first time in 10,000 years in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate the land, water, fire and air, making it easy to use.
The domestic goats should be kept in herds that have been grazing in pastures or other areas of pasture, sometimes watched by shepherds who are children or adolescents. These methods of grazing are still used today.
The trains were built in England in the 16th century.
All lives consist only of the lives of the people who are in the same boat, the vagabonds of the wagons with the horses that go faster and carry heavier loads in the parts of the road that are more difficult.
The tracks were forced to be built with great effort in order to maintain the lives of the people. However, the tracks are to be seen as more efficient if they were covered with iron.
This is going to become a common practice, but the wheels of the wagons will wear out more.
In the end, the rods of the mast will be replaced by rods of iron. The first rods completely of iron will be introduced in the year 1767.
The first transport system known to have been used by humans was the Neanderthal, who began to walk upright about two million years ago, with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means upright man).
The australopitecs, the first men, did not walk on two legs.
They have found specializations of bipedalism in fossils of australopithecines of 4.2-3.9 million years ago, and that the sahelanthropines could have walked on two legs over 2 million years ago.
We can start to live in a more respectful way with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists for the reduction of the pain that could exist in the future.
This works only for the symptomatic treatment in the majority of cases. However, if we want only a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem and we have to disable it.
It is evident that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and the problems have increased because of the excessive population and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After his adoption by the Congress on July 4, 1776, he is sending a formal letter to the printer, John Dunlap, and the Secretary of Congress, Charles Thompson, at the printing office of John Dunlap, located a few blocks away.
During the night they print between 150 and 200 copies, which are known as "Dunlap volants".
The first public reading of the document will take place at Independence Hall on July 8.
George Washington is sending a letter to the King of Spain on July 6, which will be delivered to the King's troops in New York on July 9. A copy will be sent to London on August 10.
The 25 copies of Dunlap's plates that are still extant are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original manuscript has not been perused.
Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and that they are alive.
Many people don't see us as dinosaurs because we have feathers and can fly.
But there are many birds that assemble into a dinosaur.
They have a lot of teeth and claws, and they put them in our backs, just like a tyrannosaur would.
Practically all the computers that we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can only have two possible values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers or bits, according to the jargon of the computer science.
The internal enverinament can be that not be evident immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting is general, so it can not be made an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of environmental health in winter is the presence of a public health service or the availability of domestic chemical products.
Instructions on how to use the specific auxiliary verbs for the specific verb in the label.
The term insect is used for entomologists to refer to a group of insects.
This term derives from the anti-parenting of the xinxes, which are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
The reduvids and the xinxes are so rare, that they are only seen in the nest of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it the most common neurological disease in young adults and adults in their prime.
L'EM is a neurological disease that affects the central nervous system, the medulla spinalis and the optic nerve.
The research has concluded that women have twice the probability of suffering from multiple sclerosis than men.
One pair of shoes can decide what to do with your child is not the best for your interests or the interests of your child.
These parallels could be used to adopt a new law for swimming.
A child is adopted by a second parent, the first parent's rights are terminated so that another parent can adopt the child.
The main objective of science is to understand the world through the scientific method. However, this method guides the vast majority of scientific research.
Yes, experimentation is not the only way to test a hypothesis, and an experiment is a proof used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers are centred on the classics and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotelian epistemology is accepted by all scientists, including psychology.
In this way, the knowledge of the Greeks will decrease, the Orient will be disconnected from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that are observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production using biological tools.
The rhythms of the periodic phenomena, which are not simple responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in the majority of cases, such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological oscillators are self-oscillating autonomous systems that follow an inertia period until the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase are going to serve fags, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
Two experiments marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive phosphorus.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the gene affected, and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
Only the mutations in the germinal cell line can be transmitted to the sons, and mutations in any other location can cause cell death or cancer.
The tourism based on the natural environment attracts people interested in visiting the natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife.
Examples of activities in situ include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to nature reserves and information centres.
An example of visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, the people of the small rural communities get up to go to work and pass by the other side of the road where the work is.
In this dynamic vehicle, in some way, is connected with, and gives support to, a system of private transport based on coins.
The science shows us today that this colossal economic system of carbon has collapsed one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has given support to the evolution of man during the last two million years.
Tothom participates in the society and uses transport systems. Gairebé tothom is that the systems of transport.
As a country develops, you will often hear complaints about the quality of water or the subsidence of bridges.
Why do the transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fall so often? Is it because the engineers are incompetent? Or is it because there is a fundamental lack of something?
The Flow of Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that are established between them.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver with 100% certainty.
For each trip, the conductors behave in a fairly constant range; in any case, the flow of transport tends to have a considerable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To represent the better the flow of traffic, relations have been established between the three main characteristics of Catalan: (1) cabal, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These relations help with planning, design and construction of the railways.
The insects are the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to double their strength by using their wings.
This provides a great variety of small places where you can hide from the predators.
Today, the insects that can't fold their wings are the wasps and the ephemera.
Aristarchus of Samos, a Greek astronomer, is said to have asserted that the sun is moving around the earth.
Hi, I'm glad you think that the one who did it was right, but many people thought the opposite; that the Solar System is moving towards the Earth, including the Sun (and all the other stars).
It seems reasonable, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, or yes?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the longest in the world. It transports 8 times more water than the second longest river in the world.
The Amazones are also the widest river of the Earth, sometimes it is more than a thousand miles wide.
20% of the water that comes from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is the longest river in the world, with a length of 6,387 km and a discharge of 1,000 cubic meters per second.
The construction of pyramids with stone will continue until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the method and technical excellence of the construction of the pyramids of Gizeh will not be surpassed.
The Egyptians were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, who had more than a thousand years.
The population of the City of Vatican is of 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and in its official communications.
The Italian is also the daily language of the majority of people who live in the state, while the Catalan is used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the City of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
It is a matter of knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, which can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposes that everything is composed of a mixture of four elements. These are earth, water, air and fire.
The four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, all and only, according to his theory, can be converted into new substances that form what we see.
The alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. You must know that the periodic table has many elements.
The elements with calcium and potassium are considered metals. It is clear that there are other metals such as silver and gold.
I can also hold the small quantities of elements that are not metallic, such as carbon.
All the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms in the final point of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil will become a good friend of many people when it is invented.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of our writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and use.
In the actual situation, I write messages on the computer, without needing a typewriter.
I can ask you what will happen when the sun rises.
The bomb works with the principle that energy is released by uniting a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to the energy of a heavy cart costs a lot. Separating the nucleus from this energy will be possible.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break up with a small or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is covered with rocks and poles. The outer layer of the Moon is called "scorched".
The measure of the forest is 70 km in the middle and 100 km in the outskirts.
It is more common under the moon and more abundant in the mountains.
It may be that the moon is more visible because the face is more prominent. It was easier for the lava to come out to the surface.
The theories of content are centered on what pleases or interests the people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and desires that have been internalized so that they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want to do certain things and what makes them do certain things. They will do things that are certain to happen, and they will do things that are certain to happen.
Theories of famous contents are the Theory of the Hierarchy of Human Needs of Maslow and the Theory of the Two Factors of Hertzberg.
In general, there are two types of behaviors that administrators can start to lead their colleagues. One extreme is to try to follow "a new me" (the new me).
This type of leader has problems taking unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, making long-term evaluations, assigning responsibilities and making others responsible for their actions.
In the case of the opposite, the individual is transformed into an individual that feels that it has to change all that has been done by the equipment and make it his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the exit and the failure of the team.
This behaviour often ends in a fight between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtuals are subject to the same standards of excellence as the conventional ones, but with some small differences.
The members of a virtual group can work together immediately by using the contact point of the group.
To have more autonomy than the members of the conventional teams, since their teams can meet at different times according to the zones they are in, which the local team can not understand.
The presence of an "invisible" equipment manager (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual equipment.
The invisible equipment is the equipment administrator to which each member is addressed.
Why would you want to establish a long-term process of establishing an organization to learn? One of the objectives to put into practice the concept of learning organization is innovation.
Creativity and innovation can emerge when all the available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
In consequence, the joint work of an organization to overcome a challenge can lead to a process of innovation to respond to the needs of the client.
Because an organization wants to be innovative, the leader has to create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) explains how to approach continuous improvement in a way that helps organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data will provide physical proofs for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Therefore, the area of investigation will be reduced and the research will be more accurate.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavior is a fact that the scientists have been able to prove.
It is known that the different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions and tumors can affect the behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The new technologies allow us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that were not visible before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build models that will help us to understand processes in our mind.
The AI has strong connotations of science-fiction, and is a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research in AI implies to make machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
In the examples of control, planning and programming, the capacity to respond to the diagnostic and questions of the client, as well as the recognition of the script, the view and the sound.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The system of the AI in the Arab world is frequently used in various economic, medical, engineering and military applications, since it has been built in various domestic and video games.
The thematic areas are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
The technology offers the solution to the problem of virtual travel. Students can see artifacts from museums, visit an aquarium or enjoy the beauty of art while they are in class.
Sharing a virtual journey is also a great way to reflect on a journey and share the experiences with future students.
For example, each year the students of the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to Washington, DC, each year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online as a reference.
The blogs can also help to improve the writing of the students. However, the students can start their blogging experience with a bad grammar and spelling, which can change with the existence of a public.
As students are often the most critical, the blogger started to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogs "force" students to be more astute with the world around them. The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be more curious and to be more interested in the world around them.
The blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and learning outside of the traditional school day.
The appropriation of blogs "can help students to be more analytical and critical; they can define their own positions in the context of what they write and also highlight their own perspectives on specific issues in a concrete way (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting bilingual capital of Canada and it has a series of art galleries and museums that show the past and present of Canada.
To the south there are the Niagara Falls and to the north there is the beautiful natural reserve of Muskoka and more to the north.
These are all the elements, among others, that make Ontario one of the best cities in Canada for foreign investment.
The population of the great extensions of the north is more scarce, and some zones are still uninhabited.
For a comparison of populations that are usually surprising: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Catalans.
The Islands of the Eastern Africa are found in the Eastern Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is the most different, and a continent in itself, in terms of life.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as tourist destinations on the beach.
The Arabs also want to bring Islam to the lands, and they will take a great path to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route to India.
North of the region is the Sahel, and to the south and west is the Atlantic Ocean.
Dones: It is recommended that any woman who is married, regardless of her civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (one that doesn't look like a wedding ring).
The women are not afraid to admit that the differences in culture can cause them to be considered as assets, and it is not frequent that they are persecuted, beaten with the hand, etc.
Rebuts the homes with firmness, and we do not want to defend your position (either or without cultural differences, it is not good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the fishermen of the Xth century, and the Romans, the Berbers and the Byzantines, who used it as a strategic port, which was named Anfa.
The Portuguese will destroy it and they will rebuild it under the name of the White House, only after abandoning it after a terratrèmol in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco will rebuild the city of Casablanca with the name of Daru l-Badya, the name of Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting places to visit in Morocco.
The old Medina can be easily found places to buy Moroccan traditional products, such as tajins, terrissa, objects of pell, narguils, and a large variety of souvenirs, but it is mainly thought for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the extreme east, near Rwanda.
The year 2002, Goma will be destroyed by the lava of Nyiragongo, which will bury the majority of the roads of the city, especially the center.
If Goma is as safe as it is claimed, it would be wise to investigate before any visit to this city to assess the current state of the conflict in the Kivu North province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo and for some of the gorillas of the mountain's economic importance in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to go to Goma. The normal price (local) is 500 Congolese francs for the trip.
The combination of the relative inaccessibility of the city and the fact that it is a "Timbuctu" (a city in the Sahel region of Africa) has made it a metaphor for exotic lands.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, totally ruined and converted into a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it will be included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desertification.
It will be one of the main parades during the special "African Wonders" by Henry Louis Gates for PBS.
The city is found in strong contrast with the rest of the country because it has a more Arab air than African.
The Kruger National Park is situated in the north-east of South Africa and covers the border with Mozambique to the east, and Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecozones, each with its own unique wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the reference of the national parks of South Africa (SANParks).
The entrance fee to all the national parks in South Africa is R50 per person.
It is also possible to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa, including all the National Parks of South Africa.
The Island of Hong Kong gives the name to the territory and is the main centre for tourists.
The buildings that make up the urban silhouette of Hong Kong are related to a graphic of bars that is evident with the presence of the skyscrapers of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, abandon the island and go to the other side of the Kowloon Peninsula.
The vast majority of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is located on the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonists will occupy, so it is a good idea to start from here if you want to prove the past colonial past of the territory.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the territory of India is now named Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only the pantans of mangroves, but also include some of the last remaining patches of the powerful jungles that once covered the plain.
The Sundarbans are a 3,850 km² area, of which 1,500 km² is covered by water.
From 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for the endangered life, and it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Asiatic elephants in the area.
The buses from the inter-urban bus station (on the other side of the river) run all day, but the majority, especially those that are directed to Jakar/Bumthang, run between 6:30 and 7:30.
As the buses between districts often get full, it is recommended to buy a ticket with some days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
The shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to places like Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The bridge of the river Oyapock is a bridge attracting. It has been built at the long of the river Oyapock to unite the cities of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges of the Oyapock to Guiana French.
The towers have a height of 83 metres, a length of 378 metres and two tracks of 3.5 metres width.
The open space under the bridge is 15 metres high. The construction will be finished in August 2011, so it will not be possible to cross it until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be fully functional in September 2017, when the Brazilian engineers will be on site.
The Guarani people were the most important indigenous group in the Paraguay Oriental, and they were also hunters and gatherers who practiced some agriculture for subsistence.
The Chaco region was the land of other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
The Paraguay, formerly known as "The Province of the Giant Indians", will be created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization that will last three centuries.
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, the Paraguay has kept a great part of its character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams in the world.
The most important polo tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can also see other matches and smaller games during the rest of the year.
For news about the tournaments or to buy tickets for the polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Malvinas is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), with a value equivalent to a British pound (GBP).
The dinners can be eaten in the only restaurant on the islands, which is found in Stanley, in front of the FIC West shop.
Generally, the British Isles are accepted as part of the United Kingdom and also as targets for credit and dollars of the United States.
The islands in the periphery probably will not accept credit cards, although they can accept British and American money; this was proved by the owners of the properties with the advance of the owners to determine which method of payment is accepted.
It is impossible to change the money of the Malvines out of the islands, so that you must go there to change it.
As Montevideo is found south of the Equator, there it is summer when the northern hemisphere is winter, and viceversa.
Montevideo is found in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures are usually over 30 °C.
Winter can be very cold: temperatures rarely go below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no particularly "wet" or "dry" stations: the amount of rain is more or less constant throughout the year.
All the animals of the park are used to seeing humans, but they are still wild animals and they should not be fed or bothered.
According to the authorities of the park, the distance between the bones and the animals is 100 yards/metres and between the animals and the rest of the animals is 25 yards/metres.
More than you can imagine, bears, wolves, ants, bones and all the big animals can attack.
Every year, hundreds of visitors are injured by these animals. These animals are large, saved and potentially dangerous, so please keep your distance.
I also want to remind you that the smell of the animals is not only in the meat, but also in other animals, such as the bear, the wolf, the fox, the badger, the wild boar, the deer, the rabbit, the hare, the wild cat, the lynx, the weasel, the otter, the marten, the polecat, the beaver, the otter, the mink, the ermine, the weasel, the polecat, the marten, the beaver, the otter, the mink, the ermine, the weasel, the polecat, the marten, the beaver, the otter, the mink,
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia is the capital of Samoa and was founded in 1850.
The port will be the scene of a famous insurrection in 1889, when the ships of Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon it.
All the islands will be sunk, and the British will be drowned. In addition, they will lose 200 ships of state from the United States and Germany.
During the Mau movement's independence struggle, a peaceful meeting in the city will result in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are abundant, since Auckland is the horse of two ports. The most popular are in three zones.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) are facing the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay, north, to Devonport, south.
Most of them are on the shore and they are safe, and most of them have shadow thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, the most expensive beaches in Auckland.
These are sometimes beaches with a good range of shops along the coast. They are safe.
The most famous beer in Catalonia is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is refreshing and pleasant. The other local beer is "Manta".
They can take many French wines, but the wines of New Zealand and Australia do not tolerate the trips well.
It is the water of the local well, but if you want to drink it, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of tallat is foreign. A café is a café is a café, the capuchino is well filled with cream (without foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate is melting in Belgium. The fruit juices are very good, but the quality is excellent.
The whole year we make many journeys and only rarely are there serious injuries caused by these causes.
Follow these recommendations from the authorities, respect all the signals and pay close attention to the security alerts.
The cubozous are found in the rivers and estuaries from October to April. They are also found outside these months.
The bulls exist, but they rarely attack humans. The majority of bulls are afraid of humans and become docile.
The sea turtles do not live active lives in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of the rivers to the north of Rockhampton.
Reserve your room in advance so that you can be sure that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
The agents of travel often have agreements with hotels, so that you can reserve other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
The agents of travel sometimes offer packages that include the breakfast, transport from/to the airport and all-in-one packages with flight and hotel.
We can also keep the reservation and have time to think about the offer or to present other documents for your destination (for example a visa).
