The U.S. Geological Survey's international earthquake map did not show any seismic activity in Iceland the week before.
The Icelandic Meteorological Office also did not report any seismic activity at Hekla during the past 48 hours.
The seismic movements of great magnitude that caused the change of phase occurred on March 10, in the northeastern sector of the caldera that is located at the top of this volcano.
Dark clouds were registered at the base of the mountain, which are not related to volcanic activity.
The clouds constituted a possible cause of confusion as to whether or not there really had been an eruption.
When the breakdown occurred, the Moon was carrying 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board and the strong winds and the waves pushed it against the breakwater.

Karno is a well-known, although controversial professor of English who taught at Modern Education and King's Glory and who claimed to have had 9000 students at the peak of his career.
In the notes I used words that some parents thought were rude and, according to the reports, used bad words during class.
Modern Education accused him of publishing large advertisements on the buses without being authorized and of lying when he said he was the principal instructor of English.
He was also accused in the past of violating copyright, but no charges were brought against him.
A former student reported that the man "used lunfardo language in the classes, taught skills for using during dates, and acted as if he were a friend of the students"
In the last three decades, China has developed a market economy, even though, officially, it still has a communist regime.
Under the command of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic reforms were introduced.
From there, the economic volume of China has grown 90 times.
The export of automobiles from China exceeded, for the first time, that of Germany and surpassed the U.S. as the most important market for this industry.
In twenty years, the GDP of China could be higher than that of the United States.
Hurricane Danielle was the fourth hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Danielle originated in the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, presents winds that reach a maximum constant speed of 40 mph (64 km/h).
The experts at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will intensify and become a hurricane by Wednesday.
Due to the fact that the storm is far away from the ground, it is still difficult to analyze the potential impact that it will have on the United States or the Caribbean.

Fortunately, I am well, but I witnessed a terrifying scene when people tried to break the windows to escape.
Although people were using chairs to break the windows, the windows were impossible to break.
A survivor, Franciszek Kowal, "said that one of the glass panels finally broke and began to escape through the window."
The light and heat that emanates from the stars is generated when the atoms of hydrogen fuse (or combine) to give rise to more massive elements.
The scientists concentrate their work on developing a reactor capable of generating energy in the same way.
Despite this, it is a problem of very difficult solution and it will not be possible to achieve the construction of fusion reactors useful until many years.
The tension of the surface causes the needle to float on the water.
The surface tension is due to the fact that the molecules of water on its surface attract each other with much more intensity than the molecules of air suspended above them.
Molecules of water form an invisible film on its surface that allows objects like needles to float on it.
The blade of the modern ice skates has two edges separated by a concave space between them, which allows for better adherence to the ice, even when the blade is inclined.
As the lower edge of the blade is slightly curved, when it is inclined towards one side or the other, the edge that comes into contact with the ice also curves.
This makes the skater turn. When the skates lean to the right, the skater also turns to the right; if they lean to the left, they will turn to the left.
To recover the previous energy level, they must get rid of the additional energy they received from the light.
A small particle of light called a "photon" is emitted.
The experts call this process "stimulated emission of radiation", since the bright light stimulates the atoms, which generates the emission of a photon of light, which is a type of radiation.
In the image that follows are atoms that emit photons. Of course, these are, in truth, much smaller than those of the image.
The size of the photons is even smaller than the size of the matter that composes the atoms!
After working for hundreds of hours, the filament in the light eventually burns out and it stops working.
Then, the bulb must be changed. It is necessary to be careful in the replacement.
The first thing to do with the lamp is to turn off its switch or disconnect it.
This happens because the electricity that runs towards the casing in which the bulb is inserted can cause a serious electric shock if you touch the inside of that casing or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partially in the casing.
The heart, which pumps blood, is the most important organ of the circulatory system.
The blood flows from the heart through arteries and returns to it through veins. The smallest vessels are called capillaries.
With his dentition, a triceraptops would have been able to crush not only leaves, but also branches and roots very hard.
According to some scientists, the Triceratops' diet was based on cicadas, a type of plant common in the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of spiny leaves.
The Triceratops could have broken off the leaves with its robust horn instead of eating the trunk.
Other scientists argue that there are few chances that any dinosaur ate these plants, given that they are highly poisonous; however, in the present day, the lazy and other species, such as the parrot (which descends from the dinosaurs), can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
What effect would the gravity of Io have on me? If you were standing on the surface of Io, your weight would be less than on Earth.
Someone whose weight on Earth is 200 pounds (90 kg) would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. This means, of course, that Io's gravity exerts less attraction.
The Sun does not have a crust like the Earth, on which one can stand. It is composed entirely of gases, fire and plasma.
As it loses proximity with the sun, the gas becomes lighter.
The external part that can be observed when directing the gaze to the sun is called the photosphere; that is, "sphere of light"
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer, Galileo Galilei, was able to observe, through the telescope, that Venus had phases, just like the moon.
The phases are produced because only the face of Venus (or of the moon) that looks towards the sun is illuminated. This phenomenon supported the Copernican theory that the planets orbit the sun.
Later, in 1639, Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, was able to see a transit of Venus.
After reconquering Danelaw, England had enjoyed a long period of peace.
Nevertheless, in 991, Ethelred fought against the largest Viking fleet since Guthrum's, from the previous century.

The Korean alphabet is the only alphabet designed deliberately that is still in use today. It was invented in 1444, during the reign of Sejong (1418-1450).
Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and one of those who won the greatest respect.
The original name given to the Hangeul alphabet was Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the correct sounds to teach the people."
There are many theories about how the Sanskrit language came to exist. One of them speaks of an Aryan migration from the west towards India, which brought with it the language.
The Sanskrit language is ancient, comparable to the Latin spoken in Europe.
The first book of which we have knowledge was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of Upanishads, this language simply disappeared, for reasons of hierarchy.
The Sanskrit language is a complex and rich language that served as a seedbed for many modern languages of India, as well as Latin is the source of European languages, such as French and Spanish.
At the end of the battle for France, Germany started to plan the invasion of Great Britain.
Germany assigned the attack the code name "Operation Lobo Marino". The British army was quite weak, due to the fact that it had lost most of its heavy weapons and supplies during its evacuation from Dunkirk.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and would have destroyed any invading fleet that tried to enter through the English Channel.
Despite this, they were very few the bases of the ships of the Royal Navy that were located near the possible invasion routes, since the admirals feared that the air attack by the Germans would sink them.
Let's explain the plans of Italy. Fundamentally, Italy was the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
His army and navy were weaker, although four new ships had just been built just before the start of the war.
Italy had as its primary objective the African countries. To capture them, it would need a platform for launching troops so that these could navigate the Mediterranean Sea and, thus, invade Africa.
For this, they had to get rid of the bases and the British ships located in Egypt. It was supposed that, apart from these measures, the Italian battleships did not have to do anything else.
Now, Japan. This is an island country, just like Great Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to move and remain underwater for long periods of time.
During the First and Second World Wars, submarines were used. At that time, they were very slow and their range of fire was very limited.
At the beginning of the war, they traveled mainly on the level of the sea, but, as the radars and acquired greater precision, the submarines were forced to dive to avoid being detected.
The German submarines were called U-Boats. The Germans were very good at navigation and operation of their submarines.
Given their success with submarines, since the war they do not generate confidence that the Germans are owners of large quantities of this type of ships.
Yes! One of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt in the modern world is the king Tutankhamun, sometimes called "Tut" or "the boy king".
Strangely, in antiquity it was not regarded as of much importance and in the majority of the lists of the ancient kings it was not registered.
Despite this, he became famous after the discovery of his tomb in 1922. While many ancient tombs were looted, Tutankhamun's tomb remained almost intact.
The majority of the objects that were buried with Tutankhamun have been preserved in good condition, among them, thousands of artefacts made with precious metals and exotic stones.
The invention of the wheel made the chariots of the Assyrians lighter, faster and better prepared to leave behind the soldiers and other chariots.
The deadly arrows of the ballistas could penetrate the armor of the enemy soldiers. Around the year 1000 BC, the Assyrians incorporated the cavalry for the first time.
A cavalry is a force of combat mounted on horseback. In those times, there were no horses; the Asirian cavalry fought on the bare backs of the horses.
We know many politicians, men of science and artists from Greece. It is likely that the most famous figure of this culture is Homer, the proverbial blind poet, writer of two poems, masterpieces of Greek literature: the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sófocles and Aristophanes continue to be famous writers of plays and their works are considered to be among the best in the world literature.
Another Greek figure of renown is Pythagoras, mathematician mostly known due to his famous theorem about the relationship between the sides of the triangles.
Several estimations have been made about the number of speakers of Hindi. It is estimated that Hindi is the second or third most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers will be different depending on whether dialects that are very related to each other are included or not.
Different calculations estimate that there are between 340 and 500 million people who speak the language and up to 800 million who can understand it.
Although they are similar in terms of vocabulary, Hindi and Urdu differ in the way they are written. In everyday conversations, speakers of the two languages can generally understand each other.
The German culture exercised a marked influence on the northern part of Estonia in the 15th century.
Some German monks wanted to bring the people closer to God, which is why they invented the literal Estonian language.
His base was the German alphabet and he incorporated a character: "Õ/ õ".
With the passing of time, many words taken from German fused. This marked the beginning of enlightenment.
It is tradition that the future successor to the throne enlist directly in the army after completing his/her education.
Despite this, Charles attended Trinity College, Cambridge. There he studied anthropology and archaeology and, later, history, receiving a 2:2 (a second-class degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to obtain a university degree.
The Turkish Europe (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia, in the Balkan Peninsula) comprises 3 % of the country.
The territory of Turkey has more than 1600 kilometers of length (1000 mi), 800 kilometers of width (500 mi) and has a more or less rectangular shape.
The surface area of Turkey, including the lakes, is 783,562 square kilometers, of which 755,688 square kilometers are in the southwest of Asia and 23,764 square kilometers are in Europe.
The surface area of Turkey is placed in the 37th position of the largest countries in the world, with a similar size to that of France and the United Kingdom together.
Three of the sides of Turkey are rolled by seas: the west, by the Aegean Sea; the north, by the Black Sea and the south, by the Mediterranean Sea.
Although Luxembourg has a long history, its independence did not occur until the year 1839.
In the past, the present-day parts of Belgium belonged to Luxembourg, but, after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s, they became Belgian.
Luxembourg has always tried to maintain itself as a neutral state; however, Germany invaded it in both world wars.
Luxembourg became, in 1957, a founding member of what is now called the European Union.
The Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery that is located to the north of the district of Paro, in Phondey Village.
According to the story, in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortification with the purpose of commemorating his victory against the Mongolian-Tibetan army.
The portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal is one of the few relics that have remained of the Drukgyal Dzong, as a result of a fire that occurred in 1951.
After the fire, it was preserved and it was given protection to the fortress, which keeps its place as one of the most formidable attractions of Bután.
The Kingdom of Cambodia was cornered between two powerful neighbors during the 18th century. They were Thailand and Vietnam.
During the 18th century Cambodia suffered several invasions by the Thais, who, in 1772, destroyed Phnom Phen.
At the end of the 18th century, Cambodia also suffered Vietnamese invasions.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans do not have a job and the majority of those who do, work in the informal sector.
Two-thirds of Venezuelan workers work in the service sector, around a quarter work in industry, and a fifth work in agriculture.
In Venezuela, oil is an important industry, in which the country is a net exporter, although only 1% of its population works in this sector.
After the nation declared its independence, the expertise of the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped to transform the island into a tropical garden city.
In 1981, the Singapore Orchid was chosen as the national flower.
Every year, around October, approximately 1.5 million herbivores migrate towards the lowlands of the south, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills, in search of the rains.
After that, they return to the north by the west, again crossing the Mara River, once the rains are over, in April.
In the region of Serengeti you will find the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the Maswa Game Reserve, all of them in Tanzania. In Kenya you will find the Masai Mara National Reserve.
Learning how to develop interactive media involves having conventional and traditional skills as well as the mastery of tools in interactive classes (graphic design, audio and video editing, narrative, etc.).
The interactive design requires you to reconsider your assumptions about the production of media and to develop a non-linear thinking.
Interactive design requires that the components of a project connect with each other, but that at the same time they retain their meaning as separate entities.
The negative aspect of the objectives with zum is that the complexity of the focal and the number of elements of objective that are required to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than those required for the fixed objectives.
This problem is becoming less important thanks to the fact that the manufacturers of lenses are able to achieve higher standards in their production.
This has made it possible for the objectives with zum to produce photographs of a similar quality to those obtained with the fixed focal lenses.
Another disadvantage of lenses with zoom is that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is, in general, reduced.
This makes it difficult to use cheap zoom lenses in low light or without a flash.
One of the most common problems when it comes to converting a movie to DVD is over-exploration.
The design of most televisions is aimed at pleasing the general public.
This is the reason why all the images that appear on television are cut off at the top, bottom and sides.
This is done to ensure that the image is fully displayed on the screen. This is called overexploitation.
Unfortunately, when creating a DVD, it is very likely that the edges will be cut off and, if the video has subtitles near the lower margin, they will not be seen completely.
The typical medieval castle has served as inspiration for a long time to the imagination and evokes images of jousts, banquets and Arthurian chivalry.
Even standing in the middle of ancient ruins, it is easy to evoke the sounds and smells of battles that happened a long time ago; almost to hear the impact of the horses’ hooves on the cobblestones and to feel the smell of fear that emerged from the dungeons.
But, does our imagination have an anchor in reality? What was the reason, to begin with, for building castles? What method was used to design and build them?
The called castle of Kirby Muxloe is not such a thing, but rather, a fortified house, something typical of that time.
His great windows of crystal and his thin walls could not have resisted a determined attack for too long.
In the decade of 1480, when Lord Hastings began his construction, the country was quite peaceful and all that was needed was defense against small groups of vagabonds.
The balance of power was a system through which the European countries sought to maintain the sovereignty of each of the states of that continent.
The national governments used to change their alliances in order to maintain the balance, since they shared the idea that all European nations should try to prevent one of them from becoming too powerful.
The War of Succession of Spain was the first whose main objective was the balance of power.
This delimited a change of great importance, given that the European powers would not be able to resort to the excuse that it was a religious conflict.
On the 21st of July in the year 356 B.C. the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed in a premeditated fire caused by Herostratus.
It is said that his motivation was to achieve fame at any cost, and that the Ephesians, outraged by this, announced that the name of Herostratus would never be registered.
The Greek Strabo, an erudite in history, noted his name later, which is the one that we know today. The temple was demolished the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay for the reconstruction of the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Later, after his death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.
Make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible while continuing to play the notes correctly. In addition, try not to make many strange movements with your fingers.
Thus, he will tire himself out the least possible. Keep in mind that, unlike the piano, it is not necessary to press the keys too hard to obtain a greater volume.
If you want to raise the volume by playing the accordion, you must use the valves with more pressure or speed.
The mysticism consists in seeking the link, the identity or the conscious recognition of a supreme reality, divinity, truth immaterial or God.
The desire of the believer is a direct experience, sensation or appreciation of the divine reality, of the god or deities.
His followers are proposing to adopt certain forms of life or practices whose objective is to nourish those experiences.
The mysticism can be distinguished from other types of beliefs and religious cults by its emphasis on personal direct experience of a unique state of consciousness, in particular, those of a peaceful, wise, happy or even euphoric character.
The Sijism is a religious cult coming from the Indian subcontinent. It was born in the 15th century in the Punjab region, as a result of a sectarian division within Hinduism.
The Sikhs have the conviction that their creed constitutes a religion separate from Hinduism, but they recognize their origins and Hindu traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "the way of the Guru". The Guru is an essential aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism, it has acquired an importance that forms the axis of Sikh beliefs.
Guru Nanak (1469- 1569) founded the religion in the 15th century and was followed, in succession, by nine other gurus.
Nevertheless, in June of 1956, the promises of Krushchev were put to the test, when the disturbances in Poland led by workers who protested against the lack of food and the wage cuts, led to a general strike.
Although Krushev sent tanks to restore order, at the same time he made room for some of the economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The civilization of the valley of the Indus developed in the Bronze Age, in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, which includes the majority of the present territory of Pakistan and some areas of the northwest of India and the northeast of Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the Indus Valley, from which it takes its name.
Despite this, some experts estimate that, due to the fact that the civilization also existed in the now dry Sarasvati river basin, it would be more accurate to call it the Indus-Sarasvati civilization; on the other hand, others call it the Harappa civilization, which is the name of the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s.
The martial nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the development of advances in the field of medicine.
The Emperor Augustus began to recruit doctors who, in fact, formed the first Roman Medical Corps, whose function was to intervene after the battles.
The surgeons had knowledge of different sedatives, such as morphine extracted from poppy seeds or scopolamine, extracted from the seeds of the belladonna plant.
Not only did they become specialists in amputation to save those who suffered from gangrene, but also in making tourniquets and arterial pins to stop the flow of blood.
With the passing of the centuries, the Roman Empire advanced widely in the area of medicine and developed much of the knowledge that we have today.
The Pureland model is an origami in which only one fold can be made at a time, not those that are more complex, such as inversions, and all have simple locations.
John Smith developed it in the 1970s in order to contribute with the inexpert folders or with reduced motor skills.
From a very young age, children develop a certain awareness of race and racial stereotypes and these affect their behaviour.
For example, those small children who identify with a minority racial group held a stereotype according to which they do not do well in school develop a tendency to fail once they become aware of the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace occupies the third place among the most popular websites used in the United States and, at present, has 54 million profiles.
These sites have attracted a lot of attention, particularly in the educational field.
There are positive aspects in these websites, such as the possibility of setting up a virtual classroom that can contain blogs, videos and photos, among others.
This page is of simple access, since it has only one web address, which makes it easier for those students who may have problems using the keyboard or to spell to remember it and write it with ease.
It is possible to personalize it so that it is easy to read and, also, regular the presence of color, according to what is preferred.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development.
It is not a learning disability, but a disorder of the same; "They are affected between 3 and 5 percent of children, possibly up to 2 million in the United States."
Children with TDA have difficulty concentrating on things like schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things they like, such as playing, watching their favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble because "they adopt risky behaviors, get involved in fights and defy authority" to stimulate their brains, which cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
The TDA affects the relationships with other children, given that the other children do not understand why they act as they do, why they write the way they do or why they do not share the same level of maturity.
As the capacity to acquire knowledge and to learn varied from the way already referred, the base rate of acquisition of knowledge also varied.
The approach for acquiring knowledge changed. The pressure no longer pointed to the individual memory, but to the ability to remember the text.
Basically, the Renaissance meant a change in the perspective of learning and the transmission of knowledge.
The hominids, in contrast with other simians, no longer use their hands in locomotion nor to support weight or swing from tree to tree.
The fact that the hand and foot of the chimpanzee are of similar size and length indicates that they use the upper extremity as a support for their weight when they walk on their knuckles.
The length of the human hand is less than that of the foot and its fingers are straighter.
The fossilized bones of the hands of two to three million years ago show this change in the use of this extremity from locomotion towards manipulation.
There are those who believe that submitting oneself to many sessions of conscious sleep induction can be really exhausting.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the product of lucid dreams, which extend the time between REM states.
As a result of producing less REM sleep at night, the frequency of this state in which the body transits to real sleep and recovers its energy, becomes scarce enough to become a problem.
It's just as tiring as if I woke up every twenty minutes or so and watched television.
The effect that it will have will depend on how often the brain tries to produce lucid dreams during the night.
Almost from the beginning, the Italians did not do well in North Africa. After a week since the country declared war on June 10, 1940, the 11th British Hussars had taken Fort Capuzzo, in Libya.
The general Lastucci, engineer in chief of the Tenth Italian Army, was caught by the English during an ambush to the east of Bardia.
The allied fire eliminated, on the 28th of June, the marshal Italo Balbo, governor general of Libya, and supposed successor of Mussolini, during his landing in Tobruk.
Fencing, a modern sport, is practiced at various levels, from students who exercise in the university to olympic and professional competitions.
The main way to practice this sport is through duels, in which two fencers face each other.
Golf is a sport in which participants try to introduce balls into holes, hitting them with a club.
There are eighteen holes in a regular round of golf and, generally, players start on the first hole and finish on the tenth.
The player who reaches the lowest number of strokes, or strokes with a stick, to finish the route.
The game is played on grass, and the grass that surrounds the hole is cut more and is called green.
Perhaps, the most common style of tourism is that the majority of people relate to the trips: the recreative.
This happens when the travelers choose a destination very different from their usual life in order to relax and have fun.
The beaches, the theme parks and the camping sites are, often, the places that most tourists visit when they travel for pleasure.
The cultural tourism is that whose objective is to visit a site in particular to know its history and its culture.
Tourists can visit different reference points in a particular country or simply focus on a single area.
When they saw this activity, the colonizers also asked for reinforcements.
The reinforcements for the forward positions included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments, with 200 soldiers, below the command of the colonels John Stark and James Reed, who later rose to the rank of generals.
The men of Stark spread out along the north end of the colonists' location.
When the tide receded, a crack opened up along the Mystic River at the eastern end of the peninsula, and they quickly extended the perimeter by building a low stone wall to the north that reached the edge of a small beach.
Gridley and Stark placed a stake at about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and gave the order that no one should fire until the regular army had passed.
The base of the U.S. strategy was the launch of coordinated attacks from three different points.
The general John Cadwalder would initiate a diversionary attack against the British troops in Bordentown, with the aim of blocking any type of reinforcement.
The general James Ewing avoided the escape of the antagonistic troops by taking the bridge over Assunpink Creek and guiding 700 soldiers across the river at Trenton Ferry.
The most important attack, carried out by 2400 men, would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton to then divide into two groups, with the aim of launching an attack before dawn: one of them under the command of Greene and, the other, led by Sullivan.
When a quarter mile is changed to a half mile, the speed loses much of its importance, while the resistance becomes absolutely necessary.
From now on, a middle-distance runner of the first category, who can run under two minutes, must have a good level of speed, but must cultivate resistance to the utmost.
The way to prepare for the racing season is the combination of something of racing on the track during the winter season with a superior body training in the gym.
It is not possible that the appropriate nutritional practices, on their own, generate an elite performance, but they can have a great influence on the general well-being of young athletes.
Having an adequate energy balance, adopting effective hydration habits and learning about the different aspects of supplementation can help athletes increase their performance and enjoy their sport more.
Distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions about the few equipment requirements to participate.
There are articles that can be acquired if they are estimated to be necessary; however, the majority of them will not have a real impact on performance, or their impact will be minimal.
Athletes can feel that they prefer a product, even though it does not provide real benefits.
The atom can be considered as one of the cornerstones for the construction of all matter.
It is a very complex structure that is formed, according to the simplified Bohr model, by a central nucleus around which orbit electrons; something similar to the planets that orbit the Sun. See Figure 1.1.
There are two particles that make up the nucleus; these are the protons and the neutrons.
While neutrons have no electric charge, that of protons is positive and, that of electrons, negative.
To examine the victim, you must first inspect the scene to ensure your own safety.
Must observe the position in which the victim is located when approaching him or her, as well as any automatic alert signal.
If trying to help results in injury, it may make things worse.
The study determined that depression, fear, and over-functioning interfered with the relationship between pain and disability in patients with lumbar spine diseases.
Only the effects of catastrophization, not the depression or the fear, were conditioned to structured sessions of AF, weekly and regular.
Those who participated in regular activities demanded greater support in terms of negative perception of pain, marking the distinctions between chronic pain and the sensation of discomfort present in habitual physical movement.
The vision, or the ability to see, is in charge of the sensory organs (eyes) of the visual system.
There are many different ocular structures; their complexity varies according to the needs of the organism.
The different constructions have different capacities, they are susceptible of having different lengths and degrees of sharpness; they also require a different processing to give meaning to the input and different numbers to work optimally.
A population is the gathering of organisms of the same species in a particular geographic area.
When individuals members of a population share some phenotypic trait in an identical manner, they are called monomorphic.
Polimorphs are those who exhibit various variants of the same trait.
The warrior ant colonies also walk and make nests in different phases.
During the nomadic stage, the ants fight at night and, during the day, they camp.
The colony starts a nomadic phase when the available food decreases. In this phase, they form temporary nests that are changed daily.
Each one of these mad marches or wandering marches lasts approximately 17 days.
What is a cell?
The basic unit of all living beings is the cell and every organism is formed by one or more of them.
Cells are basic and crucial for the study of life. Indeed, they are often called "the basic components of life".
The nervous system maintains homeostasis through nerve impulses that are sent throughout the body so that the flow of blood does not stop.
These nervous impulses can be sent quickly through the body, which helps to keep it safe from any potential threat.
Even though the areas that are hit by tornadoes are small, compared to other aggressive storms, they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes uproot trees, tear off panels from buildings and hurl vehicles into the sky. The 2 % most aggressive tornadoes last more than three hours.
These colossal storms bring winds of up to 480 km/h (133m/s; 300 mph).
For thousands of years and thousands of years people have been making and using magnifying glasses.
However, the first true telescopes were developed in Europe, at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and the essence of cooperation is that, when the majority benefits, there will always be more to gain by acting selfishly in the short term.
With luck, most people come to realize that their best option in the long term is to work in collaboration with others.
Many people dream of the day when humans travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some wonder what is out there, others believe that there are extraterrestrials or other forms of life on other planets.
But, if this were to happen, it would probably not last long. The stars are so dispersed that there are billions of kilometers between the ones that are "neighbors".
Perhaps, some day, his grandchildren will be at the top of an alien world, asking questions about their old ancestors.
Animals are formed by numerous cells. They ingest food and digest it in their interior. Most of them can move.
Animals are the only ones that have a brain, but not all; jellyfish, for example, do not.
Animals can be found in any corner of the planet: they dig in the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the skies.
The cell is defined as the smallest structural and functional unit that forms a living organism (things).
The term cell derives from the Latin word cella, which means "small room".
If he examines a living being under a microscope, he will notice that it is composed of small squares or spheres.
Analyzing a cork with a microscope, Robert Hooke, an English biologist, observed small squares in its structure.
They looked like rooms. It was the first person who observed dead cells.
The elements and compounds are capable of changing state without suffering alterations.
In its gaseous state, nitrogen retains the same properties as in its liquid state. Although in the second case it is denser, the molecules do not vary.
Another example is water, which is formed by two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it is in liquid, solid or gaseous state.
Although his physical state may vary, the chemical remains the same.
Time is something present in all places and that has effects on all our actions; however, it is difficult to understand it.
Both the religious scholars, as the philosophers and the scientists have studied the time for thousands of years.
We experimented the time as a series of events that pass from the future through the present towards the past.
Time is also the way in which we compare the duration (extent) of events.
It is possible for you to mark the passage of time by observing how a cyclic event repeats itself; that is, something that occurs regularly.
In the present, people use computers to manipulate images and videos.
It is possible to design sophisticated animations by computer, something that is becoming more and more common to see both in television and in the cinema.
Often, the recording of music is made with sophisticated computers in order to process and mix sounds.
For many years, during the 19th and 20th centuries, the belief was that the original inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted giant birds called moas.
Later, the theory established the idea that the Maori people had emigrated from Polynesia, on board a Great Fleet, and had dispossessed the Moriori of New Zealand, establishing there an agricultural society.
New tests suggest, however, that the Moriori were a group of Maori from New Zealand who left New Zealand and settled on the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinctive pacifist culture.
In addition, there was another tribe, formed by the Maori who left New Zealand, who settled in the Chatham Islands.
They named themselves Moriori, then there were some fights and, finally, they were eliminated.
Those who were part during several decades, helped us to value our strengths and dedication, at the same time that they evaluated with sincerity the difficulties and even the failures.
While we were listening to others tell their personal stories, about their families and about their ways of organizing, we collected information that was useful about the past and about some of the personalities that had effects, positive or negative, on the culture of the organization.
Even if knowing the personal stories does not imply understanding the culture, at least it helps individuals to be able to represent the place they occupy within the history of the organization.
During the process of analysis of the successes and awareness of the failures, the individuals and groups of people involved discover with greater depth the values, the objective and the forces that drive the organization.
Remembering previous corporate behavior, and the successes achieved thanks to them, contributed to opening people up to new changes and directions for the local church.
These success stories attenuated the fears of change and created positive inclinations for change in the future.
The convergent thinking patterns are methods for solving problems that relate to different ideas or fields, in search of a solution.
The central aspect of this way of thinking is the speed, the logic and the precision, as well as the identification of factual issues through the reuse of existing techniques and the collection of data.
This class of thinking has as its principal premise the existence of only one correct answer. It is thought in terms of two possible answers, one correct and the other incorrect.
This type of thinking is related to certain sciences or standardized procedures.
Those who think in this way, have a logical thought, can remember patterns, solve problems and work in scientific experiments.
Humans are, by far, the species with the most talent for reading the minds of others.
Hello implies that we have the ability to make accurate predictions about the perceptions of other people, what they intend to do, their beliefs, knowledge and desires.
Among these capacities, understanding the intention of others is crucial, as it allows us to resolve possible ambiguities in the physical actions.
For example, if you saw someone break the window of a car, you would probably assume that they were trying to steal the car of a third party.
He should be judged differently if he had lost the keys to his own car and was trying to get into someone else's.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working for Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (working for Harvard University).
During this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause the emission, on the part of the atoms, of very small radio signals.
It was a doctor and scientific investigator called Raymond Damadian who, in the year 1970, discovered the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as an instrument for medical diagnosis.
After four years, he was granted a patent, the first of its kind in the world related to magnetic resonance.
In 1997, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first whole-body magnetic resonance scanner, which he named the "Indomitable".
Asynchronous communication fosters taking time to reflect and react to others.
Permits students to work at their own pace and control the pace of the instructional information.
In addition, there are fewer limitations in terms of time, making it possible to have flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the global computer network allows students to have access to information at any time.
The students can also send queries to the instructors at any time of the day and receive a reasonable response, instead of waiting until the next meeting in person.
The postmodernist approach to learning entails the liberation of the absolutes; there is no one correct way to learn.
Indeed, there is not only one thing that is good to learn. Learning takes place through the interaction between the knowledge presented and the one who incorporates it.
To illustrate this point, we only need to refer to our current experience with all the TV programs that focus on learning, and bricolage and presentation of information.
Many of us have found ourselves watching television programs that provide information about processes or experiences that we will never be able to apply or use that knowledge.
We will never repair a vehicle, nor will we build a fountain in the backyard of our house, nor will we go to Peru to examine ancient ruins, nor will we remodel the house of our neighbor.
The submarine fiber optic cables that connect Greenland to Europe and the broadband satellite make it possible for Greenland to have good connectivity and that 93% of the population have access to the Internet.
His hotel or his hosts (if he is staying in a bed and breakfast or in a private house) probably have wifi or a computer connected to the Internet and all the villages have a café with Internet or some place with public wifi.
As has already been pointed out, while the word "esquimal" is still accepted in the U.S., many Arctic communities do not consider it offensive, in particular in Canada.
Although there is the possibility that I will hear the term from the mouth of the Greenlandic people, who come from other countries, they must avoid using it.
In Canada, the residents of Greenland are called Inuit and, in Greenland, kalaalleq (plural of kalaallit); i.e., Greenlandic.
The crime and animadversion towards foreigners in general are practically non-existent in Greenland. Even in the cities there are no "rough areas".
The cold climate is, perhaps, the only real danger with which those who have not prepared can have to deal.
If you visit Greenland in the cold seasons (considering that the further north you go, the lower the temperature will be), it is crucial to take warm clothes.
The long days of summer can make it difficult to sleep enough and cause other health problems.
During the summer, you also have to protect yourself from mosquitoes from the north, although they do not transmit any disease, they can be very annoying.
Despite the fact that the economy of San Francisco is related to its tourist attraction at a global level, the same is diverse.
The most important industries are the professional services, the public sector, the financial sector, commercial activities and tourism.
The fact that it is frequently evoked in songs, films, works of literature and in popular culture has helped to make the city and its monuments famous around the world.
With a great variety of hotels, restaurants and convention facilities of the highest level, San Francisco has been developing a great tourist infrastructure.
In addition, San Francisco is one of the best cities in the U.S. to find other types of Asian cuisine, such as Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese.
The trip to Walt Disney World is, for many families from the United States, a great pilgrimage.

A fantastic way to see all the charm of the southern African region is to drive in a car, which, in turn, will allow you to access places outside the usual tourist routes.
This can be done in a common car with careful planning, but the most recommended is to do it in a 4x4; in addition, there are many places that can only be accessed with a 4x4 with wide distance between axles.
When planning your trip, keep in mind that, despite the fact that South Africa is stable, not all the countries that surround it are.
As for the requirements and costs for obtaining a visa, this will depend on the country of origin and, in addition, varies from country to country.
In addition, each country has its own laws that determine what emergency items must be found in the car.
Victoria Falls is a city in the west of Zimbabwe, passing the border with Livingstone, Zambia, and close to Botswana.
The city is located next to the waterfalls, which are its main attraction, but this well-known tourist destination also offers, both adventurers and travelers, a great number of options for a longer stay.
In the rainy season (November to March), the flow of water will increase and the waterfalls will be more impressive.
Don't you think he'll get wet if he crosses the bridge or walks along the sinuous paths near the waterfalls?
On the other hand, it is precisely due to the high volume of water that his vision of the real cataracts will be obstructed ¡by all the water!
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). The tomb KV62 can be considered the most famous in the Valley of the Kings, scene of the discovery by Howard Carter, in 1922, of the almost intact burial of the young pharaoh.
Nevertheless, compared with the greater part of the other royal tombs, the one of Tutankhamun hardly deserves to be visited, given that its size is much smaller and it is much less decorated.
Anybody interested in observing the damages caused to the mummy during the attempts to extract it from the coffin would be disappointed, given that only the head and shoulders are visible.
Currently, the jewels of the tomb are not there, but have been transferred to the Egyptian Museum, in Cairo.
For the visitors with little time it would be convenient to invest in another place.
Phnom Krom. It is a temple built on the top of a hill at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of Yasovarman, 12 km south of Siem Reap.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view of the Tonle Sap lake make the climb up the hill worth it.

You need the pass to Angkor to access the temple, so don't forget your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.
Although Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, the majority of other states and the United Nations do not recognize it as such.
The legendary city in the Judean Mountains has an incredible ancient history.
The three monotheistic cults; that is, Jews, Christians and Muslims, consider it holy land and functions as spiritual, religious and cultural center.
For the religious significance of the city and, in particular, a good number of sites in the old city that are still standing today, Jerusalem is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Israel.
There are many historical, archeological and cultural sites in Jerusalem, in addition to vibrant and crowded shopping centers, bars and restaurants.
In the case of citizens from Cuba and Ecuador, Ecuador requires that those citizens have a letter of invitation before entering the country through international airports or border posts.
It is required that this letter be accompanied by the legalization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and that it meet certain requirements.

In truth, it seems to be more a way of deceiving people to make them believe they have to pay more.
Located at the northern end of Machu Picchu, this mountain has a steep slope, and is often the background of many photographs of the ruins.
From below it is a bit overwhelming, the climb has a strong slope and is complicated, but the majority of people with a reasonable physical state should be able to complete it in approximately 45 minutes.
The stone steps extend along almost the entire path and, in the parts of greater slope, the steel cables offer a handrail.
Nevertheless, prepare yourself for the lack of air and be careful in the most pronounced parts, especially when they are wet, because they can become dangerous very quickly.
In the upper part there is a small cave through which you have to pass. It is quite low and narrow.
On board of a boat is the best way to contemplate the places and the wild life of Galápagos, as Charles Darwin did in 1835.

He will assure you that your personal preferences or limitations will coincide with the boat that best suits you.
Until the 16th century, during the pre-Hispanic era, the north of Chile was Inca territory, while the Araucanians (mapuches) lived in the center and south of the country.
The Mapuches were also one of the last native American tribes to be absorbed by the Spanish language, not being completely absorbed by the Spanish language until after the independence of Chile.
Although Chile's independence was declared in 1810 (the period in which, as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, Spain was without a central government for some years), the decisive victory against the Spaniards did not occur until 1818.
The Dominican Republic is a country of the Caribbean that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which shares with Haiti.
In addition to its beaches of white sand and its mountain landscapes, the country hosts the oldest European city in America, which now forms part of Santo Domingo.
The first inhabitants of the island were the Taínos and the Caribs; these latter, who spoke the Arahuaca language, had arrived in the island approximately in the year 10 000 B.C.
A few years after the arrival of the European explorers, the Spanish conquerors reduced the Taíno population in a significant way.
According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Treaty of the Indies), the colonists from Spain killed about 100,000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498.

The countries that participate exhibit their artistic and educational samples in national pavilions, to illustrate global problems or the history and culture of the country.
International horticultural events are specialized meetings in which flower arrangements, botanical gardens and everything related to plants are exhibited.
Although in theory they are supposed to be done once a year (as long as they are in different countries), they are not done in practice.
These events usually last from three to six months and are held on properties with a surface area of at least 50 hectares.
Through the years, many formats of films have been used. The standard, of 35 mm (negative of 36 by 24 mm), is the most common.
