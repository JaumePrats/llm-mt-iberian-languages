Concerned members of the Galician parliament because "they look like Muppets"
Several members of the assembly have expressed their consternation at the proposal to change the title of the members of the Welsh Parliament to Member of the Welsh Assembly.
This debate has arisen because of a change in the name of the parliament from Parlament de Catalunya to Parlament de Catalunya i València.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure could become a source of mockery.
A member of the Labour party has said that his party is worried about the fact that MWP "is associated with Twp or Pwp".
For the readers who don't speak Galician: In Galician, "twp" means "stupid" and "pwp" means "shit".
A member of Plaid Cymru's assembly has commented that his party "hasn't got the best of hands" and has proposed various alternatives.
On the other hand, a conservative member of the group has said that his group is "open" to the change of name, but he has also commented that there is a big difference between the terms "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, we can say that the letter “w” in galician is pronounced like the letter “u” in English from Yorkshire.
According to the committee in charge of elaborating the draft law to introduce the changes in the names: "The final decision on the qualification of the members of the assembly will be made by the members of the assembly."
The Law of 2017 of the government of Galicia gives the Assembly of Galicia all the power to change its name.
In the month of June, the committee will publish the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with a large support for the proposal to change the name of the parliament from Parlament de Catalunya to Parlament de Catalunya.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, even though the committee is going to vote for “Members of the parliament” or “WPM”, the option of “MWP” is the one that is going to get the most support from the public.
It seems that the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. In any case, the intention to achieve a consensus could mean that the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, will present the legal basis for the changes in the next few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will celebrate the final vote on the name during the debate related to the legislation.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The citizens of Skopje will vote on Sunday if they want to change the name of their country to “Republic of Macedonia of the North”.
The referendum is going to decide on a dispute that has been going on for decades between Greece and Macedonia, which already has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time that the name of its northern fleet represents a way to claim its northern territory and has repeatedly opposed the intentions of this country to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he will ignore the results of the referendum.
On the other hand, those who are against, such as the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, think that the change of name is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's church stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“Historically, there has always been a bar and a church in every village”, says Mr. Adams.
“Today, we don’t have to choose between the two.”
According to Adams, it is possible to understand the disappearance of the bars.
“The people have a different way of socialising today”, he says.
“The bars are no longer the same as they used to be. They are now a place where people go to have a good time.”
As for the churches, they are worried that the dinners they get from the sale of acts will not last as long as they have predicted their leaders "and that they will have to go back to the place where they came from".
The churches, could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the type of people that will not be of any help to the temples that will remain in the barri.
“The vast majority of the people who buy apartments in these buildings are white people”, he says, “and because of that, it will accelerate the process of closing down all the churches, as it is very unlikely that the majority of the people who move to these buildings are members of these churches.”
Two white churches will be built before Harlem becomes a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in two years later.
The white Methodist congregation that had been founded in the early 30's was going to disappear during the 30's.
A black congregation that has been there for a long time is going to acquire the property of the building.
St. Martin's is going to pass to a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who is going to lead a boycott against merchants on 125th Street, one of the main commercial streets of Harlem, which is resisting to contract or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire will cause great damage to the building, and when the reverend Johnson's parishioners decide to rebuild the church, it will be then that the carillon will be installed.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of the Reverend Johnson and successor of the St. Martin's Church, will describe the carillon with great pride as "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who is going to do the sonar in July is going to describe it in a different way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, will also observe that the first carillon of the world is going to be touched by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who is going to have to transfer the largest carillon in the Riverside Church in 18 years.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's is not going to be replaced.
The one who hasn't rung at St. Martin's during the last two months, on the contrary, has been the complicated history of architects and contractors, some of them carried by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the head of the parish, composed of lay people, has written to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese "pretends to transmit the costs" to the parish council, which is not going to be involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the diocese is going to send.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was killed by a bull in California.
A bull is going to attack and injure a 13-year-old boy this Saturday while diving for lobsters in California, the first day of the season for lobsters, according to the authorities.
The attack will take place just before 7 in the morning at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel at the KSWB-TV in San Diego, he was driving for about an hour with some friends in the morning of Saturday when he felt the gunshots of a new request for help. The police arrived at the scene and found a group of people trying to help the man to get out of the water.
Hammel said that the first thing he thought was that he had caught a lobster, but then he realized that he had been tricked.
He had his whole clavicle stripped
“Because everyone was coming out of the water, I shouted: 'There's a shark in the water!'”, said Hammel.
The child is going to be transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he will be in a very bad state.
We don't know what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, the rescue swimmer Larry Giles said that they had detected a tiger shark in the area, but that they had decided that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles is going to say that the victim suffered from head trauma in the upper part of the torso.
The authorities are going to close the beaches from Ponto Beach to Swami's Beach for 48 hours because of the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles will point out that there are more than 135 species of tauró in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, to the market of the products of beautiful of the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's has decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products in the style of the big department stores.
These large submarines are only a part of a considerable investment in the market of beauty products in the United Kingdom, a market that is worth some 2.8 billion pounds and that continues to grow while the fashion and beauty products sectors are doing well, and they will try to open 11 new shops in the whole country to expand their business further.
The investment in beauty products is the result of the desire of the supermercats to make the most of the space available to them to provide services that were previously destined for televisions, radios and other products of the llar.
Sainsbury's says it will double the number of beauty products on offer to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also have more space for brands that are similar to the ones that can be found in Boots.
The company of supermercats is also in the process of launching a line of make-up products called Boutique, so that the majority of the products are suitable for vegans, a feature that is increasingly demanded by young consumers.
The minorista The Fragrance Shop will open two concessions in Sainsbury's stores. The first one will open next week in Croydon, south of London, while the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The internet has changed the way we buy food and has made us buy in smaller quantities each day at smaller supermarkets. The big supermarkets have had to find other ways to convince people to buy their food.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, the stores will be getting bigger and bigger as the chain tries to compete with Aldi and Lidl by offering more products and services.
Sainsbury's has introduced points of sale of Argos in many of its supermercats, as well as Habitat stores, which it is going to acquire totally two chains, which has helped to increase sales.
The initial intention of the chain of supermercats to launch their departments of beauty products and pharmacy will result in a failure.
Sainsbury's is going to carry out a joint operation with Boots at the beginning of the decade of 2000, but it will end up failing to agree on how to divide the benefits of the chain of drugstores within the supermarkets.
This new strategy has been in place for three years after the sale of 281 Sainsbury's pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have a very important paper in the global market, as it will expand its range of luxury products for the skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have changed the appearance of our products of beauty in order to improve the environment for our customers."
We've hired a lot of people with specific skills that will be of great help when it's time to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the surrounding area and the practical location make it one of the most attractive destinations for products of beauty and well-being.
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby was paid 11 million GBP
Dragons' Den's Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby, the presenter of the TV show, made a deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV worth 11 million pounds.
Willoughby doesn't have the time to devote himself to the joint negotiation of products from the oven and accessories Truly.
The negotiations between the two medical experts had reached a point where they had to compare the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, who is 37 years old, is going to use Instagram to announce her engagement.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones furious by pulling out in the last minute of the negotiation of a fashion lifestyle contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also report great benefits for her.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the red star of the television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the agreements with the presenter, for a value of 1.5 million pounds, would imply that he would no longer have time to devote to the joint products of the brand and accessories Truly.
The negotiations had reached the point of comparing the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow with that of Willoughby, which was estimated to be worth 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby was 37 years old, he was going to use Instagram to announce his marriage to Jones. He was going to take a private jet to one of his vacation homes outside of the United Kingdom.
According to a source: "It was Holly's main priority at the time."
It was destined to be his future, and we would have seen it during the next 30 or 40 years.
His decision to go back in time will leave no trace for any of the involved parties.
No one could believe what was going to happen on Wednesday, we were so close to the launch...
At the same time there is a room full of merchant ships at the Marlow central.
According to the experts, the launch of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions of pounds due to the important investment that had been made in products, from coixins and espelmes to roba and roba for the llar, and from the possibility of delays in the launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the captain of three ships, and Dan Baldwin, his first mate, have been having an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a long time.
Willoughby is going to found Truly in 2016, and Jones, who is 52 years old, is going to join him as president in March.
Both of them spend their holidays together. In addition, Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the new ambassador of Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!
A proper response by Jones would have been "We won't comment on our negotiations."
Tough accusations... "and then we'll fall in love"
I'm just making a joke about the possible criticism that some medias might make about the fact that I'm so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why has Trump given up on so much?
Trump is going to say that he is going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it.
"I haven't given up."
It is interesting to note that Kim had an interest in celebrating a second meeting after the first meeting held in Singapore in June was declared as a great success in the denuclearization of North Korea.
Unfortunately, the nuclear disarmament negotiations are at a standstill.
More than three months after the summit celebrated in Singapore on June 12, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to its "first initiatives" for disarmament.
The United States continues to apply sanctions with the goal of maintaining pressure.
The point of view of Trump, in change, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
Let's declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people lost their lives.
We maintain this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong-un have had positive results: missile tests, aid for the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
I'm going to defend the usual focus on talking about the relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but when you have 10,000 people trying to get into this place, you’re going to have 200,” Trump said, pointing at the crowd that had gathered in front of the White House.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths caused by a tsunami and a volcanic eruption in Indonesia
After the terratrèmol of Lombok, for example, it will be clear to other non-governmental organizations that it was not necessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of the population of Lombok will have to be relocated, the government will not declare a national disaster, in order to be able to ask for international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they don’t want any international assistance, so the situation is very urgent,” says Mrs. Sumbung.
If Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it's not sure that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, head of the national disaster agency, is going to comment on the situation in Palu to see if it is allowed or not for international agencies to provide aid.
The constant earthquakes that happen in Indonesia, the country is not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Even though Aceh has built refuges in case of a tsunami, they are not frequent in other coasts.
The apparent lack of sirens in Palu in case of tsunami, even though there was an alert in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge number of islands of Indonesia is, in the best of cases, like a reptile.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was moored at the port of Lombok to attend the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu; meanwhile, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
The president of Indonesia Joko Widodo had as a central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of the infrastructure of Indonesia, and he invested a huge amount of money in railways and roads.
Meanwhile, the government of Joko has to deal with the fact that the country is in debt.
Joko also has to deal with the pressure of the permanent tensions between the country's two main political parties, members of the Muslim minority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1000 dead and thousands of wounded are the result of the battles that take place on the roads between Christian and Muslim bands, with arrows, crossbows and other bloodthirsty weapons.
Observe: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool scores the equalizer with a header in front of the Chelsea goal
Daniel Sturridge is going to save the Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against the Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge is going to break a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to within 27 metres of the goal of Chelsea when his team was losing 1-0.
The pilot is going to move to the left side of the ship before leaving an incredible turn to the right.
The shot will create the whole area in front of the goal with a great elevation while propelling the ball to the right of the goal.
In the end the pilot will start the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in order to try and avoid it and will end up at the bottom of the network.
“I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always try to do that as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible for myself,” says Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that it was Kanté, I gave him a tap and I didn’t think about it, I just focused on shooting.”
The Chelsea was 1-0 up after 25 minutes, thanks to a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the left back of the blue team, Mateo Kovacic, will make a pass to Griezmann before running to the Liverpool's goal.
Kovacic is going to make a quick combination from the middle of the pitch.
After that, he made a great pass in depth, leaving the Hazard in the area controlled by the pilot.
Hazard is going to overcome the defence to score the second goal with a shot from the left side of the pitch, but he won't be able to reach the Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday the 15th of September at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Nàpols, Italy.
The Chelsea, on the other hand, will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and the tsunami has risen to 832, according to data from the disaster agency of the country.
Many people will be trapped between the ruins of collapsed buildings due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that will take place on Thursday and that will cause floods of up to 6 metres, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, will be completely covered by the rubble of the destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was found stabbed to death.
The investigation into the murder started after the body of the woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The woman, aged 44 years, was found at 7:55 a.m. with various stab wounds at Grayson Mews, John Street; shortly after, a man of 32 years was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police have asked the residents of the area if they have seen or felt anything that could be related to the crime that is being presented to the authorities.
According to the inspector Brian O'Hagan: "If we find anything, we'll let you know."
I would also like to give a ride to any person, especially taxi drivers, who might have been able to catch something on the car's camera, which is in contact with the driver, as this could be vital information for the investigation.
A police officer has confirmed that the woman is from Birkenhead and that she is going to be found in a property.
This evening, friends who think they know the woman have come to the scene of the crime to ask questions about her whereabouts.
While the investigation is still going on, the police have commented that they are investigating the family members closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who saw Grayson Mews has tried to get in, but the police told him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When the war is over, there won't be anything left to say.
The residents are starting to realize that they can't stay in their houses for more than a few hours.
It's going to be possible to feel like a police officer was explaining to a man that the whole area is covered by the crime scene.
A woman is going to appear on the scene crying.
He doesn't stop repeating "It's terrible!"
At 14:00, two police vans were found in the cordoned off area with another van parked outside.
A number of Romanian agents in the cordoned off area were controlling the block of flats.

The statue of Oliver Cromwell from the British Parliament is the latest monument to be affected by the "rewriting history" campaign
His disappearance would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England, perpetrated by his fanatical followers.
The Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "bogeria" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "It was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would become one of the main objects of the debate about the statues."
The iconoclasm of the civil wars in England will not be ordered or ended by Cromwell.
Maybe the Cromwell would have been destroyed if it wasn't for the actions of its previous captain.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many people believe deserves to be commemorated.
Goldsmith will tell The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps most, to have been a man of the 19th century rather than the 17th. He was a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate representation of Roman history or not is a matter of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of means of the 17th century is going to determine the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known figure that represents this division.
Their attacks on the Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A pig killed a farmer by mistake
A farmer will be attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the south-west of Xina, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood in a butcher’s shop in Liupanshui, a city in the province of Guizhou, according to the South China Morning Post.
On the 30th of May 2005, a farmer was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines in a courtyard in Xining, the capital of Qinghai province.
According to what I have heard, he had left the province of Yunnan on Wednesday with 15 pigs to sell at the market.
The next morning, he found the dead body and discovered a door that led to a pigsty.
According to him, there was a big pig with a lot of blood on its mouth.
The forensic examination will confirm that the 250 kg grenade had killed the farmer, according to the information.
“My submarine had its cameras broken and full of blood”, said the submarine, named “Wu”, as reported by the news of the evening of Guiyang.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
It's going to be found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the property of Yuan or of his cousin.
One of the managers of the market commented on the news of the evening that the pig was going to be slaughtered and butchered in order to avoid being attacked again, while the police gathered the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, the family of Yuan and the people responsible for the market are negotiating an indemnity for Yuan's death.
There have been very few cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig is going to attack a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and the husband is going to be left with serious injuries.
A few days ago, a pig weighing 300 kg managed to steal a farmer's gun and shoot him dead.
After a farmer from Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the CBC news that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They like to play.
They're just kids, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't have the idea of doing bad.
We can only give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the south-west of the United States.
According to the predictions, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
The Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States during the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, equivalent to a category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 in the morning of Sunday, local time in the United States, and it was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that the Rosa will be heading north on Wednesday.
On the other hand, a depression is starting to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving in the direction of the west coast of the United States. When the Rosa gets close to the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will become a tropical storm, and it will start to leave a strong tropical humidity in the direction of the south-west of the United States.
The Rosa will leave on Monday with 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
After that, the tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate torrential downpours over the whole south-west during the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, flash floods and the possibility of landslides.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of 50 to 75 mm per hour in various parts of Nevada and Arizona.
They are expecting 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the south-west, especially in Arizona.
There is the possibility of forming riuades, as soon as the situation is getting worse rapidly due to the dispersal of the tropical storms.
It is completely unadvisable to enter the desert before the threat of a tropical downpour.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable. In addition, the storms could carry rats and clouds of snow to specific points.
The depression that is approaching will bring torrential rains to certain areas of the coast of southern California.
It is possible that the total precipitation could reach up to 50 mm, which could cause minor floods and minor mud flows.
The first precipitations of the season are expected in the next few days.
They will start to arrive in Arizona in the night of Thursday to Friday and in the morning of Friday to Saturday.
The torrential rains are expected to continue for the rest of the week.
In October there will be some important oscillations in temperature for all of the USA as the Arctic is going to refreeze, as well as the tropics are going to cool down.
This phenomenon can cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The region in the center of the US is a clear example of drastic differences in temperature on the same day.
There have been differences in temperature of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the heat of the summer will try to expand further.
It is expected that the month of October will start with high temperatures in the center and east of the United States, with temperatures of up to 27 °C in the plains of the south to parts of the north-east.
The city of New York could arrive at 27 degrees on Wednesday, which would be 10 degrees above the average.
According to the weather forecast for the long term, there are many possibilities that temperatures will be recorded over the mid-latitudes of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people are going to watch Brett Kavanaugh's declaration.
More than 20 million spectators will be able to watch the passionate testimony of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who will accuse him of sexual abuse, which is supposed to take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony will be retransmitted to six different television channels.
On the other hand, the political situation continued, with the broadcasters interrupting their usual programming on Fridays because of the news of the last minute: an agreement designed by the senator from Arizona Jeff Flake so that the FBI could finish its investigation of the car crashes in a week's time.
Ford is going to explain to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh was going to grope her and try to take her clothes off at a party at the institute.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, is going to say that he was absolutely convinced that this was not going to pass.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million people have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted with the help of the spectators of the channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The C-SPAN, PBS and Fox Business Network are not available immediately for other channels to retransmit the testimony, like PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen has problems to calculate the number of people that he sees from his office.
Looking at it from a different perspective, it's similar to a playoff game in American football or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the leaders of opinion of which have clearly given their support to the nomination of Kavanaugh, will be the channel with the most viewers, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the testimony of the whole day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC will be second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS will get 3,1 million, the NBC 2,94 million, the MSNBC 2,89 million and the CNN 2,52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest is still high after the testimony.
Flake will be the central figure of the drama on Thursday.
After the office of the moderate republicans emits a statement that they will vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake will be caught by the cameras of the CNN and the CBS in the morning of the next day while he was trying to get into an elevator to go to a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
Flake is going to spend several minutes with his eyes closed while he was being broadcasted live on CNN.
“Here we are, in front of you”, said a woman.
“Do you think this is the truth about the country?”
They say 'you have power, but there are so many things that you don't have!'.
Flake is going to say that his office has sent a message and, before the doors of the elevator open, he is going to say that he has more things to say to the committee.
In less than an hour, all the cable and satellite channels were broadcasting live the moment when the Senate Judiciary Committee had to vote whether or not to confirm Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.
Flake will say, in the future, that the FBI will investigate the allegations against the nominee for the week before the election, which is a condition demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake is going to be convinced by the conversations he is going to have with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake will take his decision.
The triad option for Flake had influence, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not vote for Kavanaugh without the support of the Democrats.
The president Trump has opened an investigation of the FBI for the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister, Theresa May, accuses the critics of "playing politics" in relation to the Brexit.

“Things like this happen all the time”, Wade will say.
A volcano erupted in Mexico City
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano have arrived at the warehouses of the south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Prevention of Disasters will warn the Mexicans on Saturday that the volcano is still active after detecting increased activity and 183 emissions of gas and ash in a 24-hour period.
The center was supervising various earthquakes and tremors that had recently occurred.
Images from the social networks show a thin layer of ash on the windshields of cars in the streets of Mexico City, as well as in Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the capital of Mexico when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The police have to deal with Catalan separatists just before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Protesters were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes with police during a demonstration in favour of Catalan independence. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across Catalonia to mark the first anniversary of a referendum on secession from Spain.
A group of independentists who had been arrested by the police were going to start filling them with explosives and painting them in black, which would cause the appearance of black clouds on the roads normally used by tourists.
Later that same day, the police were going to produce batusses with their shields, in order to contain the violent protesters.
During several hours, independentist groups were shouting "No oblidem, no perdonem" in front of unionists who were shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people have been arrested for throwing Molotov cocktails during the protests, according to local sources.
The tensions have not decreased in this region of mentalitat independentista one year after the 1st of October 2017 referendum considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by the separatists Catalans.
The voters are going to vote for independence by a large majority, even if the participation index is going to be low, as the opponents to the secession are going to boycott the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, at least 1000 people will be injured this year after the police attempt to break up the elections in the Catalan parliament, which will lead to violent confrontations.
The independentist groups will camp out all night on Thursday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration will take place in the same place, but the demonstrators will be forced to take a different route.
Narcís Termes, an electrician of 68 years and one of the participants in the independence demonstration together with his wife, says that he doesn't have any more hopes about the possibilities that Catalonia has to become independent.
Last year was one of the best moments.
I will be able to vote for the first time in my life, but now we are stuck here.”
Although they managed to achieve a vital victory, it was only by a small margin, in the regional elections in December 2017, the Catalan independence parties have suffered to maintain their independence this year, even though many of their leaders have been in exile or under house arrest since then.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support for the police with his mobile phone, and says that the conflict has re-awakened the politicians of both parties.
“The tension doesn’t seem to be getting any better,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new leaders of Catalonia, will announce that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Presenting oneself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the retrograde in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Homes detinguts després d'envestir una casa amb un cotxe
Three houses of 33, 34 and 39 years old have been bombed repeatedly in the same street in Londonderry.
The incident will take place at Ballynagard Crescent at 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that they are going to cause damage to the doors and the same buildings.
It's also possible that, at some point, someone has fired a ballista against the castle.
Menga's goal gave Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with the Livingston will decide the victory.
The Livingston, who last year had won promotion to the Scottish Premiership, will surprise the Glasgow Rangers, who have just suffered their second defeat in 18 games under Steven Gerrard as manager.
Dolly Menga's play will mark the difference, as with this victory, Gary Holt's team can now share the second position with the Hibernian.
The Gerrards, in change, continue to play in the Premiership this season. They will face the leader, the Hearts, with who they separate a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers beat the Rapid of Vienna to qualify for the Europa League.
The Livingston, on the other hand, widens its lead to six points at the top of the league, with a Holt as coach who is facing his first defeat since taking over from Kenny Miller last month.
The Livingston doesn't take advantage of its opportunities before the direct match of the visitors
Holt's team would have had to score much earlier than they did, as their direct play was causing all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson is going to open a path between the defence, but he is going to mess it up when he finds himself in front of the goal. After that, Alan Lithgow is going to send the pilot out to stretch himself in order to try to score the pass of Craig Halkett, who is going to create the goal.
The locals already know that the Rangers can land on the island, so they won't have any problems with the visitors landing on the island.
And that's how the decisive goal arrived.
The referee will give a free kick against the interests of Rangers and Livingston will take a free kick from the edge of the box, on Declan Gallagher and Robinson will combine so that Menga can score the first and finish from the center of the area.
At the end of the first half, Rangers had dominated the possession, but they found a defence that was almost impenetrable and a goalkeeper in Liam Kelly who had very little to do for the whole game.
The scenario is going to repeat itself in the second part, but Alfredo Morelos is going to force Kelly to make a save.
On the Rangers side, Allan McGregor will have to deal with Scott Pittman and Lithgow will have to deal with Livingston's combination play.
The Rangers are going to send two pilots to the area of Livingston, only to be shot down. In addition, they are going to claim two penalties, one for a supposed entry of Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other for manslaughter. Both of them are going to be rejected.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A great performance and a great result for Livingston.
A man thinks that they will be excellent, and they will exceed all expectations in this ascending trajectory.
His style of play and his team mates have not changed much since his return to the top flight, but a lot of the credit has to go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team from the moment he arrived.
There's going to be a good bunch of heroes.
The captain Halkett is going to be immense, with a perfectly organized defense, while Joe Worrall and Connor Goldson are going to be depending on Menga throughout the whole game.
The Rangers are going to have a hard time without inspiration.
All the brilliant moments with Gerrard as a coach, definitely they haven't been able to maintain the level.
They won't be able to create opportunities (only one of the Rangers managed to get past the local defence), and the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, will have to take it as a warning.
Bad reception for Erdogan in Colònia
On Saturday (29th of September) the leaders of Turkey and Germany are going to meet for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the diplomatic visit of the Turkish president Erdogan to Germany, who had as an objective to repair the relations between the two NATO allies.
These rights have deteriorated as a result of human rights abuses, the freedom of the press and the entry of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan, however, is going to move to Colonia to inaugurate a new mosque.
It's true that this city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police will be on high alert to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, if there is a large number of followers they will have to climb the trees to be able to see the president.
Hundreds of thousands of protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also condemned the Turkish government and the decision of the German government to welcome them to the country.
The two demonstrations reflect the division of opinions that there is about the visitant, considered a hero by some German Turks and a dictator by others.
Accident in Deptford: a cyclist was hit by a lorry
A cyclist has been killed as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened close to the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, an area with a lot of traffic, to the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle is going to be arrested and the paramedics are going to attend the cyclist, who is going to die in the act.
The accident happened a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision with a car on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of Saturday's accident.
The metropolitan police have said that their agents are working to identify the man and inform the family members.
The route has been changed and diversions have been put in place for the buses. In addition, it has been advised to the bus drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: 6 agents injured in an altercation
SIS agents have been injured in a fight in this penitentiary for high-security prisoners, according to the office of the prison.
The executions will be carried out at the prison of Long Lartin, Worcestershire, at 9:30 in the morning, local time, and will continue.
Agents "tornado" specially trained are going to move to the place where the fight is going to take place in order to land on the roof of the building, in the case of which seven prisoners have been involved.
The agents will have to be shot in the face at the location of the explosions.
According to a portaveu of the prison service: "We have deployed specially trained personnel to try and solve the incident which is still ongoing."
They have been forced to be used with injuries.
We will not tolerate violence against our people. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to answer to the police and could have to spend even more time in jail.
At the Long Lartin prison there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In the month of June, it will be known that the captain of the prison is going to be transferred to a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October of last year, the agents of the anti-aircraft defense were present at the base to solve a serious incident in which the personal of the center was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with heavy rains (areas with drought could benefit from this)
It's not usual for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what's going to happen at the beginning of next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the south-west desert, with the consequent risk of flash floods.
The national meteorological service has already issued warnings for heavy rains for Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, the south-east of Nevada, the south-west of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that the Rosa will arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and that it will take control of the ship on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix will comment in a press release that only "two tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression in a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
The hurricane Katrina (1967) is going to be 64 km away from the border with Arizona.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 50 and 100 mm of rain in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert in the south-west, such as the Rocalloses centrales and the Gran Conca, could register between 25 and 50 mm, with the possibility of reaching up to 100 mm.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the Rosa flood could be a good news, as long as the region does not suffer from a severe drought.
Although floods are a major concern, some of the precipitations could be beneficial, as the south-west of the country is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. National Weather Service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
But first, the hurricane Rosa will touch down on the Baja California peninsula, in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have force on Tuesday morning, with winds of up to 137 km/h, and was found 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is getting stronger in the Pacific, which means that it is losing strength.
Therefore, it is expected that it will land in Mexico with force of a tropical storm during the late afternoon or early evening of next Monday.
Precipitations in different parts of Mexico could be very strong, with a considerable risk of floods.
According to weather.com, "75 to 150 mm totals of rain are expected from Baja California to the north-east of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north towards Mexico with the force of a tropical storm, before arriving at the border with Arizona at first light on Tuesday morning with the force of a tropical depression, before finally reaching the state of Arizona and arriving at the south of Utah late on Tuesday night.
“The main risk we expect from the Rosa or the one that remains is strong precipitations in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the desert of the south-west of the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.”
It is expected that the pluges will cause dangerous floods in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four people for the purpose of murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with serious injuries in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at 4:00 on Saturday, local time.
He is transferred to the hospital, where he is found to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old will be arrested the day after tomorrow in the area of Radstock, according to the police of Avon and Somerset.
The agents have made a call to anyone who might have recorded any of the events with their mobile phone.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered from the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party"
“The vote for the judge Kavanaugh is the vote for the party’s despicable and disgusting tactics”, Trump declares in an electoral act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump is going to say that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic party during the whole process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh is going to declare in front of the Congress tomorrow, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford in a very emotional way, saying that he has never done anything like that in his life.
Ford is also going to declare under oath about what he saw.
The president is going to say on Saturday that, on that day, "the American people are going to see the genius, the quality of humanity and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for ratifying Kavanaugh is a vote for ratifying one of the brightest moments in the legal history of the world, a jurist with an admirable trajectory of service to the citizenry of Virginia’s Western District.”
The president is going to indirectly refer to the name of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the participation index of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“We have been waiting for five months for the most important elections of our lives.”
I didn't run away, but in reality I did.
“Because of that, I decided to run for president.”
Trump is going to argue that the Democrats are trying to "resist and obstruct".
It is expected that the first vote on Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court will take place in the Senate on Friday, according to an aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Hundreds of thousands of deaths due to the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of victims continues to rise.
At least 384 people have died, and many more have been injured due to the huge waves that hit the beaches, caused by a strong earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in Palu on Friday to celebrate a festival when a tsunami of up to six metres high hit the coast, killing many people and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami is going to be followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When the threat of a tsunami was imminent, the people were still on the beach and didn't have time to evacuate. For this reason, they were victims.
“The tsunami is not going to come all at once, it’s going to hit the coasts, trees, houses, it’s going to destroy everything that’s on the ground”, said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the sea at speeds of up to 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
There are people who managed to escape from the tsunami by hiding in a tree and they will be able to survive.
About 16,700 people have to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency show the extent of the damage to buildings and bridges and the destruction of a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas will continue to be launched from this coastal city this Saturday.
The series of tremors will be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) says that the energy released by the thermonuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, will be equivalent to 200 times the energy released by the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow valley, could have increased exponentially the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho will describe the damages as "considerable" and he will say that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels will be destroyed.
Some of the bodies of some of the victims, he says, will be found trapped between the ruins of the buildings that collapsed, and he estimates that 540 people will be injured and 29 will be missing.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the injured could increase by 300 km to the north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications "will be totally paralized and we will not be able to receive any information from Donggala", says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people there”, said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers have been heading to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, which could end up much worse,” he says.
The agency is going to be heavily criticized on Saturday for not warning of the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, even though the agents said that the waves would arrive during the time when the warning would be issued.
In a recording of a fan shared on the social networks, it is possible to feel the desperation of a man on the top floor of an apartment building warning the people of the street about the tsunami that is approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water crashed into the shore, sweeping away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters won't be able to authenticate the recording immediately.
The terratrèmol and the tsunami have caused a general breakdown of the electric system, which has interrupted communications with Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid by planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, the evacuees are in desperate need of food, as well as other basic necessities.
The airport of the city has been re-opened only for essential flights and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is estimated to be over 800.
The situation is very difficult.
Even though World Vision workers were able to get to Donggala and Palu, they had to take refuge in tarpaulins installed on the roof of their office, during the trip they will have to witness scenes of total destruction, according to Doseba.
“They’re going to see a lot of destroyed buildings,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
As well as the groups of volunteers are going to start the difficult task of helping the victims of the disaster, some people are complaining that they were not allowed to go to Palu.
In accordance with the regulations of the Indonesian government, the collection of corpses, the provision of food and water, and the deployment of personnel from abroad can only begin if a disaster has been declared a national disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, the head of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“A cop who the government says ‘it’s a national disaster’, can start asking for international assistance, but it hasn’t been declared at this level yet.”
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and relatives of the missing people are still hoping for a miracle to happen and for their loved ones to be found alive.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued from a keyhole.
On Sunday, the rescue teams were able to free a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with the cost of the sea on her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team of paragliding, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which will be concluded at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people arrested at the Hotel Roa Roa, there were also his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional baggage,” he says.
Mr. Gendon is going to explain that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the hotel Roa Roa between the parapentist community, he had sent desperate messages to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
Also, the messages appear with a grey verification mark on top of a double blue mark.
“I think that’s what they’re trying to say,” he added.
Two thieves stole $26,750 worth of goods from a Newport on the Levee store
On Friday morning, 26.750 $ were stolen from a worker of Brink's at the Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The agent Dennis McCarthy will indicate in the report that the driver of the vehicle was driving the automatic parking system at the entertainment complex and was preparing to distribute more meals.
While he was taking out his wallet, another man "was going to give him a job at Brink's" and he robbed him of a bag of money destined for distribution.
According to the communiqué, the witnesses will see various suspicious people fleeing the scene, but the police will not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about the identities of these people should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "I've known him formally as Kanye West."
It's been a long time that the West, from 41 years, has been using the nickname Ye, and it's going to use it as the title of his eighth album, which is going to be published in June.
The change is produced before the appearance of the program Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to present his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper will replace Ariana Grande, who will cancel her participation due to "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," West said at the beginning of this year, while talking about the title of his upcoming album with the radio host Big Boy.
So that's why we're here.
He changed his name from Kanye to Ye, which is simply a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, all.
The album is more of a reflex of what is going on.
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have adopted the name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, anti-collaborator of West, has decided to change his name from Jay-Z to Jay-Z without majuscules.
The president of Mexico, AMLO, has promised not to use military force against civilians.
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised not to use military force against civilians, as long as it is not necessary, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a brutal repression against students.
López Obrador is going to promise on Saturday at the place of Tlatelolco that "we won't use the military force anymore to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people at a time when the student movements were at their peak in Latin America.
López Obrador, who has promised to give support to young Mexicans by providing monthly stipends to students and making more public universities free,
He said that the lack of opportunities for education and the lack of jobs for young people are pushing them to join the criminal bands.
The US doubled the funds destined to AI
While China is becoming more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States will have to double the amount of money they spend on research in this field.
The comments come after several members of the North American government have announced measures in the field of AI, despite the fact that the country has a general lack of strategy in the field of AI.
On the other hand, the Xina is going to present its plan for the next year: its goal is to become the number one company in the world for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for research in artificial intelligence would be a good start, but the rest of the world is far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the future in the field of artificial intelligence," said Lee.
“Doubling the funding could double the opportunities that the United States has for the great discovery in AI,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the founder and CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most prominent AI companies in China.
In 1980 he moved to the University of Carnegie Mellon to work on a system of artificial intelligence that would surpass the American player of the Othello game with the best classification and, later, he would work as an executive at Microsoft Research and as the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee will value positively the previous technological competitions of the North American government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA), and will ask where the next one will take place, in order to identify the proper visionaries.
"Sometimes, the American investigators have to work for a long time to get public funding," says Lee.
According to Lee, "It's not the Chinese who are angry with the academicians; it's the companies."
In the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired thousands of university graduates to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee is going to comment that the US is also going to be affected by the changes in the policy of immigration.
I think that they will be able to automatically provide targets for resident PhD students in AI.
In July 2017, the Council of State of the Xina is going to present its plan for the development of artificial intelligence of the latest generation.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) grants funds to Chinese institutions of higher education in the same way as the National Science Foundation of the United States (NSF), but the quality of the research is inferior to that of the United States.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defense of the United States of America is going to create a Center for Artificial Intelligence Conjunction, which is supposed to bring together researchers from the industrial sector and from academic institutions, and the White House is going to announce the creation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, the DARPA has announced a $2,000 million investment in a project called AI Next.
According to the Foundation for Science and Technology, it currently spends more than 100 million USD a year on AI research.
However, it has been months now that no measure has been taken in relation to the legislation proposed by the United States to create a National Commission for Artificial Intelligence Security.
The Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide on the name of the country
On Sunday, the Republic of North Macedonia will hold a referendum on changing its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which has blocked the country's applications to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern province constitutes a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In the month of June, the two governments will come to an agreement on the new name, but the nationalists argue that the change would change the ethnic identity of the majority of the Macedonian population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is raising doubts as to whether he will reach the minimum of 50% participation required for the referendum to be valid.
The question asked in the referendum is: "Are you in favour of the adhesion to NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, argues that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that is going to create an arc of stability in the disintegration of Yugoslavia, organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have voted for the future of my country, because the young people of Macedonia want to live with freedom in the European Union, because that means that all of us will have a safer life.”
Even though it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will abide by the result of the vote.
In order to change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in the Parliament.
The Catalan Electoral Commission will inform that no irregularities have been detected in the 13th hour.
On the other hand, the participation was only 16%, in comparison with the 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, celebrated in 2016, in which 66% of the people registered voted.
Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, from Skopje, is going to vote for the first time in his life.
The first prime minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko are going to vote in the referendum on the name change of the country, which would open the way for the country to join the EU and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small scenario and placing people in front of the tents installed for the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we don’t want to join through the back door, we want to join through the front door,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.”
If they don't want to accept Macedonia, they can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of the Euroasian integration.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has said that the country's accession to NATO will be accompanied by investments more than necessary for Macedonia, which has a tax rate of more than 20%.
“I think that the majority of the citizens will vote in favour, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said before depositing his petition.
Zaev is going to announce that a "yes" would mean "confirmation of our future".
According to an opinion poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies, between 30% and 43% of the voters participated in the referendum, which is below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian channel Telma TV, 57% of the respondents said that they would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% will declare that they will vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation must be at least 50% plus one vote.
This referendum would be the first crack in the armor of the pro-western government, which is going to take place in the month of May of this year.
Look at the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, scores a goal after dribbling the whole defence of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling scored the winning goals as Manchester City beat Brighton 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) on Saturday.
Agüero is going to score a goal in the 65th minute in a play that is going to look ridiculous.
The Argentinian pilot is going to make a pass over the camp at the beginning of the sequence.
They were moving at high speed between the three defences of Brighton, destroying the one that came out of the ground.
After that, Agüero is going to be surrounded by four green samarretes.
We'll have to wait and see how many more we can get before we reach the border of the Brighton area.
He's going to make a pass to the left and he's going to find Sterling.
The English goalkeeper will be the first to touch the ball, in the area, in front of Agüero, who with his right foot will beat the goalkeeper of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that will hit the inside of the crossbar.
“Agüero has some little problems”, Pep Guardiola, the City’s coach, told the journalists.
We've decided to play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at that moment.
But it will be Sterling who will give the first advantage to the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal is going to arrive at the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero is going to play the ball in depth in the Brighton's area and
He's going to make a beautiful pass to the left to Leroy Sane.
He's going to drive the pilot before passing him over to Sterling.
The striker of the Sky Blues is going to finish the pilot inside the network before leaving the field.
The City will face Hoffenheim on Tuesday, 18:55 h, at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, with no options, will have to eliminate the Rockies
With the elimination of the National team from the play-off, there was no need to force another opening.
However, Scherzer, a very competitive player, is waiting to come out on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who maintain a lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to play in the play-offs.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Thursday night, but still need to win one more game to clinch their first division title.
“Even if we don’t get to play, at least we can get to know the environment here, in Denver, and know that the other team probably will be playing at the same level as us.
Why would you want to lose this game?
The Nationals still have to announce a missile launcher for Sunday, but it looks like they are going to let Scherzer pitch if this situation continues.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, would throw a bullpen session on Tuesday and pitch on Wednesday, on his usual day of rest.
The Washington Nationals' reliever Drew Storen has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump has a meeting in Virginia of the West
The president is going to indirectly refer to the situation of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the participation of Republicans in the mid-term elections.
All that we've done so far has been for fun.
Five months for one of the most important elections in our history.
This is one of the biggest, biggest.. I'm not going to present it, but in reality it does exist. For this reason I'm going to present it.
Trump is going to continue: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, they're still here."
They are determined to recover all the means necessary to regain their power, they see their meanness, their bad intentions.
It doesn't matter to them who gets hurt, as long as they get the power and the control. That's what they want: power and control. But they won't get it.»
The mission of the democrats is to "resist and obstruct".
“We can see this in the next four days,” he said, “and the democrats will be ‘enutjats, mesquins, bruts i falsos’.”
Trump is going to fire Dianne Feinstein, the most senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is going to cause a strong backlash from the public.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you want to filter the document?
Eh, eh, what?
No, eh, no. Wait a moment... This is a very painful expression of corporal language, the most painful expression of corporal language that I have seen.
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
It's intolerant with those who think differently.
When the activists of Momentum from my local party vote to censure me, it won't surprise anyone.
At the end of the day, the last of a series of British parliamentarians have told us that we are not welcome here.
My colleague in the parliament, Joan Ryan, is going to introduce a similar treatment for anti-semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I am going to be criticised for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe. Irònicament, these are questions similar to the ones that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
In the announcement of the meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham on Thursday it was said that "we want inclusive and productive meetings".
During the major part of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee were held on a Friday night.
Unfortunately, this is not the time for many meetings, and it has been a long time since the promise of "more generous and friendly" politicians was forgotten.
Every day it becomes more and more obvious that the divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged according to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This is going to happen soon after Jeremy Corbyn is elected leader, as many of his colleagues thought that he shared a political vision with him before, but now they are expecting him to take a 180 degree turn and adopt positions that he has never supported before, such as on national security or on the single market of the EU.
Every time I talk in public, I say what I say, the xarxes socials are filled with aggressive missatges because they don't want me to renew my candidacy, they denounce the politicians of the center and say that there won't be a PSC candidate.
This doesn't happen only to me.
Of course, I know that I have more experience than some of my colleagues, as the missatges that we receive are mostly political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who every day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they don't give up.
One of the most deceiving aspects of this era is the normalization of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn is going to declare this week that the Labour Party will promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that it's not as diverse as it used to be, and with every motion of "lack of confidence" or every change in the rules, the game is becoming more and more.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and I have been told to keep my head down, not to be so expressive and to "go with the flow".
But I didn't get involved in politics for that.
As soon as I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my student years, I was inspired by the negligent government of Thatcher, who was going to leave my class literally buried, I tried to defend better public services for those who most needed them, either as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I haven't hidden my political views, nor have I done so in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt about my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who are promoting the motion on Thursday, I would say that in a moment in which the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our businesses and public services, it is not the time to waste time and energy on the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message that I want to transmit is not going to be directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my Labour voters, either members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that I will continue to do so, regardless of any threats of non-renewal of my candidacy or any political interest that would prevent me from doing so.
Chris Leslie is a member of the House of Commons for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr beat Melrose 38-17
Two last-minute attacks have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr will win this exciting match.
The Ayr class destroyers are the only ships of their class in the world.
In the end, the local team was able to take advantage of its defensive superiority and the fact that it knew how to take advantage of the better opportunities, and the coach Peter Murchie had good reasons to be satisfied.
“We’ve tested the parts that we’ve used so far and they’ve passed the test, so I’m happy with that.”
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, will say: "Well done to the Ayr, they have taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have."
Grant Anderson's try at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, will put the Warriors in front, but Rory Hughes' try for the international side will allow Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggott will score an unconverted try.
The weather is going to widen the advantage of the Ayr with a sanction and, just in the middle of the match, they are going to score the 17-5 marker to put the score at 17-5 in favor of the Ayr.
But the Melrose will start to get better in the second part and the attack of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, will reduce the differences to five points.
After that, the game is going to be interrupted for a long time because of the injury that is going to suffer Ruaridh Knott, who is going to be taken off on a stretcher, and the Ayr are going to widen the distance with an attack by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
After that, Captain Blair Macpherson will be reprimanded with a warning shot and, once again, the Melrose will take advantage of the superiority of one of their own men, Bruce Colvine, who will finish the job in the end.
At the same time, the local crew will react and when Struan Hutchinson will see a big target on Climo without a pilot, MacPherson will fire a warning shot, but it will be too late for Climo.
The weather is going to change, as it has already started to do so after the rain, after David Armstrong recovered a cross from Kyle Rowe and passed the ball to Gregor Henry to score the fifth goal of the local team.
The star of the series Still Game seems to be on the verge of starting a new career in the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, one of the stars of the TV series Still Game, seems to be about to move into the hotel business, after it was discovered that he had been named director of a restaurant with a license.
The actor, who is 56 years old, plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-produced with Greg Hemphill, his comedy partner for many years.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, it's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, even though one of The Scottish Sun's sources claimed that Kiernan had intended to enter the "florent sector of the restaurant business" in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, without a coastline, is waiting for the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The submariners patrol the sea around La Paz.
The public buildings are flying a blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours."
Recovering it is a difficult task.»
The disappearance of the Bolivian territory without a coastline, the record of a lost coastline before Xile in a conflict over natural resources in the 19th century is still vivid, as is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the most profound in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1st, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, I can't say it better, it is waiting for a positive result.
Many Bolivians watched the resolution of the TIJ on big screens in the country, with the hope that the Tribunal de La Haia would rule in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of negotiations, Xile is obliged to negotiate an exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle for re-election this Sunday, also has many hopes pinned on the resolution of the dispute.
“We are very close to going to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in August last year.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that, in case it does, things will not change much.
The organization of the UN based in the Low Countries does not have the power to adjudicate territories in the sky and has established that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The resolution of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), which was produced only six months after the presentation of the final submissions, indicates that the case was "not complicated", according to Paz Zárate, an expert on international law.
The Bolivian cause has had a retrograde in the last four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has blocked the question of access to the sea,” said Zárate.
“The beligerant rhetoric of Morales has destroyed any chance of a good will gesture from Xile.”
Bolivia and Xile will continue talking in some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain a conversation after this incident.
The two countries haven't had ambassadors since 1962.
The former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative to The Hague, will reject the idea that the decision of the Tribunal was exceptionally rapid.
Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Xile" and "a unique opportunity to put an end to 139 years of differences, with benefits for both sides".
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, who is one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime question as a political crossbow.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
“The resolution is an opportunity for us to overcome the past.”
North Korea claims that the disarmament of nuclear weapons will not be enough to make them trust the United States
North Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho said that his country will not give up its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust the United States.
Ri is going to speak on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The U.S. Secretary of State is going to urge the U.S. government to keep its promises made during a ceremony celebrated in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries.
The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, seems to be on the verge of restarting the nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three months after the summit celebrated in Singapore with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
It is said that it is a dream to think that the sanctions will continue and that the objection of the United States to a declaration that puts North Korea in the same category as the war in Korea will make North Korea more submissive.
Washington has doubts about accepting North Korea's declaration if Pyongyang doesn't make significant moves towards disarmament.
Trump wants to have a second summit with Kim Jong-un.
On the other hand, there is a general scepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is seriously considering renouncing its nuclear arsenal.
Pompeo has planned to visit Pyongyang in May to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The runways of Paris reveal the latest collection of big hats, from a main street to a side street near you.
If you want to increase the size of your collection or if you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne have presented a collection of outlandish hats at the Paris Fashion Week SS19, which is going to define the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer the Instagram has been destroyed by a lot of people, and these designers have brought their surprising creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's piece is going to be an exaggerated barrel, decorated with a large wing, which flooded the cap of the models.
In addition to the oversized accessories, there was also a barbecue, a bottle opener and, finally, a pineapple, but none of these were designed to keep the cap cool.
Thom Browne is also going to present a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the submarines were painted in bright colors and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
A creation was being assembled of a complete set of submarines, with tubes and propellers, while the other one seemed to be an ice cream truck.
If you follow the big trends of fashion, you're in.
The observers predict that the huge submarines will be able to implant themselves on the main roads near you.
The big guns of the "Bomb", a ball-shaped gun, with a diameter of two peus, that everyone has carried, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label on the back of the shirt was so small that it was going to fall off the xarxes socials, so another great creation was added to the passarel·la: a bossa de palla for the beach, just as big as the model dressed in a banyador that he was wearing.
Jacquemus's "bossa de ràfia" bag, in a bright orange color, decorated with ràfia and finished with a white leather strap, will be the highlight of Jacquemus's SS19 collection "La Riviera" at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and sunglasses on the main beaches this summer. The designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame if the demand for large accessories was ignored."
John Edward: The linguistic skills are essential for the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain an excellent academic trajectory that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by the individual and collective efforts in esports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30.000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are working hard to offer the best possible service to their students and their parents.
The independent schools have as an objective to prepare the students for further studies and higher education, as well as for life as a citizen of the world.
With the possibility of designing and implementing a personalized curriculum, it is observed that modern languages follow a subject that is very popular and much desired by schools.
Nelson Mandela is going to say: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart."
If you talk to them in their own language, they will arrive at their core.»
This is a very important recorder that can't depend only on English if we want to establish relations and generate confidence with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the language exams, it can be seen that the languages lead the tables of classification with the highest qualifications at the independent schools.
The 68% of the students who study foreign languages are going to get an A.
The data, collected from 74 schools member of the SCIS, will show that 72% of the students will obtain an A grade in Catalan, while 72% of the students will obtain an A grade in Spanish, 69% of the students will obtain an A grade in French and 63% of the students will obtain an A grade in Spanish.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland give support to foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will need without doubt in the future.
Currently, the languages, as a matter of choice, are taught in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and in other places.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the Commission of Occupation and Competences of the United Kingdom will reveal that the main reason why employers are not able to fill vacancies is the lack of linguistic competences.
Therefore, the linguistic competences are becoming more and more important for preparing the young people for their future careers.
As soon as there are more opportunities to develop potential skills that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
It doesn't matter which career a person chooses, if they have a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent skill like this.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically makes a multilingual person more competent.
According to a survey carried out by YouGov in 2013 among more than 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom, 75% don't know how to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with a 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double digit percentage.
For this reason, it is important to teach languages to children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give the children better opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland there is a lot of variation between the schools as to which languages are taught.
Some schools will focus more on modern languages, while others will focus more on traditional languages, while others will focus more on languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, such as Arabic or Japanese.
If your son is interested in languages, he can choose between a series of independent schools, which have teachers specialised in this area.
The independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare the children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of where they go to school.
In the global commercial environment of the time, it is impossible to deny that the languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Of course, the modern languages are considered to be "internationally communicative competences".
The independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to the Scottish young people.
It's got to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron James will debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, Luke Walton, has announced that James will play the first game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But they still have to decide how much time it will play.
"They'll be more than 48", said Walton at the Lakers' official press conference.
Mike Trudell, reporter for the Los Angeles Lakers, says that James will probably play only a few minutes.
After the training sessions of this week, James is going to ask James about his plans for the six games of the pre-season of the Lakers.
“I don’t need to take part in the pre-season in this phase of my career to be at my best.”
Meeting with Trump in Virginia of the West, YouTube Channel
The president Donald Trump started a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia last night.
It is the first of the five meetings that Trump has planned for this week, which will include visits to places that are sympathetic to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for Trump's candidate for the Supreme Court is still pending, Trump is trying to get support for his own re-election campaign, as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of the Congress if they lose the elections in November.
At what time is the meeting of Trump and Putin at the White House tonight?
Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The meeting of Trump in Virginia of the West is going to be broadcasted live on YouTube.
It's likely that Trump will address the Kavanaugh hearing this week, which is going to be tense because of the sexual assault allegations against him, while the vote to confirm him is on hold until a week from now and the FBI is investigating the case.
However, the main objective of this meeting is to help the republicans who are present at the delicate elections of November to gain momentum.
For this reason, the five meetings of the president Trump planned for the next week are directed to "encourage the volunteers and the sympathizers, while the Republicans try to protect their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
The control of the Congress is so important for the president's agenda that he will travel to so many states as possible, while at the same time we will have a season of campaign attacks, according to a White House official who asked not to be identified.
This evening's meeting at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, West Virginia, could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh's communication networks.
This Saturday will be the second time that Trump visits Virginia from the West, the state will gain more than 40 points from the 2016 election.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the Senate from West Virginia, who is having bad results in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is coming to give him a push in the investigations,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Virginia’s College at Wise, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the North American team shows its ambition to keep alive the hopes of winning the individual matches on Sunday.
After three uneven sessions, the foursomes on Saturday probably will be the match that this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum effect is a sports concept invented, especially in competitions like this one.
So, where is the positive dynamic?
“We have an advantage of six points and a disadvantage of four, so I think we are in a small positive ratxa.”
Of course, Europe has an advantage, with four points in front, and six more in play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, say that the wind is a little in their favour and they have many reasons to be motivated, in large part due to the state of form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who are going to play together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee all the way to the green and he is setting an example.
The loud cheers from the crowd were getting louder and louder as the game went on, and it was a crucial moment for the team to tie the game, as Thomas had just scored two goals after two penalty shots.
He's going to celebrate the putt that he's going to make on the 15th hole with a shot similar to the one that indicates that he thinks that the American team is not out of the competition yet.
“You have to work as hard as you can and worry about your own part,” says Spieth.
It's all that's left to these players now.
18 torpedos to leave the port.
The players with the most points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The European couple are adorable, but they don't make any mistakes.
«Moliwood» will be the only team that won't have a bogey on Saturday night, and they will also avoid the bogeys on Saturday night and Friday and Saturday mornings.
For this result and the way the energy seems to flow from the public to the players, it is reaffirmed that there is only one player to beat on Sunday, and there is no other player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to win a possible European victory while the sun is setting on Le Golf National.
It would be better if they were in two different ships.
Even so, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson are going to play against Sergio Garcia and Alex Noren.
One bogey and two double-bogeys are now the first priority targets for the Spanish and the Swedes. There is no way for them to get out of this trap.
The next day, however, there was no one who could help him get out of the hole.
The fourballs and the foursomes are very interesting to watch because of the interactions between the players, the coaches that give and the ones that don't, and the way a strategy can change from the beginning to the end.
At the end of the war, Europe has played better than the US and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this session of foursomes has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the US, have questioned.
Europe won the Ryder Cup with a final score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after winning the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari will try to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficult conditions and leave their mark in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who was hoping to retain the trophy he won two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated the American team in the morning fourballs and went on to win the series 3-1.
The U.S. will present more resistance in the foursomes and will be able to reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points out of the 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while Molinari, who is nicknamed "Molliwood" after a week of sensational play, is the second pair to score four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After Woods and Patrick Reed's defeat in the fourballs, they managed to beat the Americans Bryson Dechambeau and Xander Schauffele with a 5&4 score.
Woods, who had been drenched in two parts on Saturday, showed signs of genius on the greens, but has lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and consecutively.
Justin Rose, who is not going to play in the fourballs of the morning, is going to play with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and they are going to win by 2 and 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, being the first and the third of the world, respectively.
In any case, Europe didn't have to face the full force of the war in one day, and the wind was coming from the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times champion of the tournament, and Justin Thomas set a new reference point for the Americans on Saturday, with two points.
They managed to get a victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter by 2 to 1 in the fourballs and, later, they managed to get a victory against Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after having lost the first two matches.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has an individual match been won by more than four points, and the team of Furyk, defending the title, only needs a draw to keep it.
However, after two days, it seems that the counter-attack scheduled for Wednesday is out of the question.
North Korea says it will not disarm "unilaterally" if there are no signs of trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will inform the United Nations Security Council on Saturday that the continued sanctions are intensifying the DPRK's mistrust of the United States and that, in these circumstances, the DPRK will not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho is going to tell the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea has taken "important measures of goodwill" during the past year, including dismantling its nuclear test site and pledging not to test any more nuclear weapons or intercontinental ballistic missiles.
“Don’t worry, they won’t respond in consonance with the US”, he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, they will not initiate unilateral disarmament.”
If Kim Jong-un is going to repeat the complaints that North Korea has made in the past about the resistance of the United States to a nuclear disarmament "step by step", it seems that he is going to reward the United States in proportion to the measures that Pyongyang takes "step by step", and that he is not going to reject unilateral nuclear disarmament in the past.
Ri is going to refer to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a president in office of the United States and a leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim is going to commit to work on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, while Trump is going to promise guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has tried to pose formally to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has communicated that before Pyongyang has eliminated its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the pressure to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The U.S. insists that first the nuclear program has to be dismantled and the level of sanctions has to be increased in order to achieve their goal of coercive diplomacy, in addition to opposing the "declaració de fi de la guerra".
The perception that the sanctions will have on us is a fantasy of the people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the sanctions continue to increase our distrust.
It will not refer to the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the leader of the United States is going to highlight at the beginning of next week.
In the meantime, the minister will highlight three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in in the last three months and will add: "If the party involved in the question of denuclearization is North Korea, the denuclearization of the peninsula of Korea will not have arrived at this situation of stalemate."
On the other hand, the speech of Ri will be very different from the one he made last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that launching missiles at the territory of the United States was inevitable after Trump called Kim "Rocket Man".
Trump is going to destroy North Korea completely
On Wednesday, Trump is going to say that there is no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it's two years, three years or six months".
China and Russia support North Korea's right to develop nuclear weapons.
The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is going to tell the Security Council of the United Nations today that: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the DPRK is achieved."
The Council of Security has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut off the financing of its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo is going to be found outside the United Nations General Assembly and after that he is going to visit Pyongyang to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit is not going to be a good one.
He will leave Pyongyang in July because he has made some progress, but after a few hours North Korea will accuse him of making "unreasonable demands of a gangster".
In a meeting with Moon held this month, North Korea has agreed to dismantle a missile testing site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "measures in consonance."
It is said that Kim has communicated to Trump that the "measures in consonance" that he was looking for were the measures of security that Trump had promised to Singapore, in addition to actions that would lead to normalization of relations with Washington.
The students of Harvard are doing a course on habits of rest.
Enguany, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep less, in an attempt to combat the culture of studying all night, each student studying for a longer period of time, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic is going to observe that the students of the university number u of the world are often unaware of the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, is designing the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
This is going to inspire the creation of a new course on the impact of the lack of sound on the learning process.
At the end of the war, one of them is going to say: "Why did I have to go through all of that, in my last year?"
It is said that no one has ever spoken about the importance of sound before, which will surprise you,
During the course, explained to the students for the first time the basic concepts on how to improve their academic and sporting performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and director of the psychiatric services at the University, is going to say that the University is going to decide to introduce the course after the summer break for those students who have suffered from a lack of sleep during the week-end.
The course, of one hour duration, included a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory, the students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, lamps and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light on sports performance and on the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, the participants are informed about how the lack of sound can increase the risk of attacks on the nervous system, brain damage, depression and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons allows the participants to think about their daily route.
We know that the behaviour of the students won't change immediately.
But I think they have the right to know, just like we have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on our health.
The culture of keeping awake all night long still exists, and it's going to get worse, because modern technology and the pressure of exams are going to make it more and more difficult for students to get enough sleep.
Making sure to enjoy a good quality sound for a long time would be a "secret weapon" of the students to fight against stress, tiredness and anxiety, and it would also help to avoid gaining weight, because the lack of sound makes the brain go into starvation mode and makes the students always feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physics, is going to help Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond is going to comment that the course has opened the ulls and he has been inspired to promote the course in the whole campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask the students of post-graduate studies to develop a similar program before they join the competitive institution.
The professor Czeisler recommends students to set an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga ends with the homes of Gerrard
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at home to Livingston, which means another soaking outside.
Rangers were looking to add to their first victory of the season against St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted a second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a manager, leaving his team in 8th place, 8 points behind league leaders Hearts.
Menga is going to score the goal in the middle of the first half, and it's not going to seem like the Rangers, who are lacking inspiration, are going to equal the score.
While the Rangers were attacking the Hibs' goal, Livingston were attacking the Hibernian's third position, in order to make up for the difference in goals.
The Rangers could face more difficulties after this, as the judge of the line Calum Spence will need medical attention for a wound caused by an object that appears to have been thrown from the stands.
Gerrard is going to make 8 changes to the team that will face the Ayr United in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, is going to start with the same eleven that won against Hearts last week. Of course, he is going to feel satisfied with the way his team, well organized, is going to suffocate their rivals in every moment.
If the Rangers manage to dominate the possession, the Livingston will be more dangerous when they have the ball.
Of course, they had to mark the goal in the first two minutes of the game, but the first intervention of Menga left Scot Pittman in front of Allan McGregor, but the goalkeeper was able to move out of the way and take advantage of the great opportunity.
A tackle from Keaghan Jacobs will hit Craig Halkett, but the defender Alan Lithgow will only deflect the ball to the back post.
The Rangers seemed to have more hope than the Catalans in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos believed that he would have had a penalty in the 15th minute, as Steven Lawless and Steven Lawless were about to collide, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's appeals.
The Rangers will only direct two crosses in the first half, but the first cross of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, will not have any problems with the cap of Lassana Coulibaly and the docile defender Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that he deserves it only for his effort.
Now, the Rangers won't be able to handle Jacobs' workman-like play.
Scott Arfield is not going to react when Declan Gallagher passes the ball to Scott Robinson, who is going to keep his calm to score a simple goal.
Gerrard is going to act at the break to change Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change is going to have an immediate impact, as the extreme is going to make a pass to Morelos, as well as Kelly is going to run to the block.
Nevertheless, the Livingston will continue to attract the attention of the visitors playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band could have taken the lead at the final stages, but McGregor is going to maintain the lead until Lithgow takes a wrong turn at the corner.
The Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton, is going to ask for another penalty for a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson is going to make the big saves.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
This is a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day in which the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger is going to develop a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that is going to give birth to the "Geiger counter".
The Geiger counter, which is a pillar of science, will also become a pillar of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two physicists who appear to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
Home: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When these earphones are used, you can listen to the effects of the radioactivity emitted by the minerals.
Evans: "I'm sure it's exploding right now!"
Hans Geiger is going to die in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to be seen.
A new vaccine against cancer could allow the immune system to "see" the cancer cells
A new vaccine against cancer could allow the immune system to "see" and eliminate cancerous cells.
The vaccine shows the immune system how to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
It is possible to "see" a common protein in many cancers and, after that, reinject them.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, will see the ovarian cancer disappear in less than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, later, to inject them back.
According to the professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have obtained so far suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The protein HER2 “favours the growth of various types of cancer”, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancer, explained the professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach was used to target immune cells of the patients and "educate" them to attack the cancerous cells.
Kanye West is going to get involved in a pro-Trump diatribe after wearing a MAGA hat on SNL.
It's not going to end well.
Kanye West is going to be featured on Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance on the show where he congratulated President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat with the slogan "Make America Great Again", he started to criticise the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
Whenever I talk to white people, they always ask me: How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if you're worried about racism, you should have done something about it a long time ago.
The SNL program will start with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star is making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault.
Even though it's not going to be broadcast, Chris Rock is going to push the recording of the disapproval of West on the social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he is not going to be well treated because of the hat he is wearing.
They are going to attack between the bastions.
You won't come out with that hat on your head.
They're going to be scrapped.
According to the Washington Examiner, I am in a lower position.
West is going to continue: "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he puts on the cape of Superman so that they won't be able to see what he's doing. "Do you want the world to advance?"
In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen.
Their comments provoked the ire of the public twice, and the members of the crew of the program seemed to be ashamed, according to Variety, which had a reporter who was going to explain to the public: "The study is going to be completely mutilated."
West is going to replace Ariana Grande, the ex of which, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West will leave many people perplexed with the interpretation of the song I Love it, dressed in a bottle of Perrier.
West will obtain the support of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who will say: "One of the most valiant spirits: THANK YOU FOR SHARING WITH THE MULTITUDE."
However, the presenter of the debate, Karen Hunter, is going to say that West is "essent qui és i que és absolutament meravellós."
But he hasn't rewarded anyone (buying his music or giving him support or donating to his "art") who adopts and defends an ideology that harms my community.
It's free.
We will also add.
Before the program, the rapper was going to announce on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now known as "the ésser abans conegut com Kanye West".
It's not the first artist to change his name, following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague rapper Snoop Dogg changed his name from Snoop Dogg to Snoop Lion and the disappearance of the music legend Prince inspired him to change his name.
Accusation of attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was shot in the leg in Belfast on Thursday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the accused will appear in front of the first instance court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor's office will review the charges.
The star of Jon Snow, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
Despite this, the actor, who is 31 years old, has denounced the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that these papers give the impression that young people often believe that they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with the magazine Culture of The Sunday Times, Kit said that "something had gone wrong" and that he was wondering how to face the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently got married to the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that she has a strong determination to face this problem.
“Personally, I’m asking myself if we’ve got it all wrong when it comes to masculinity,” he said.
"What have you learned from the people during the development of your project?"
According to Kit, the television can be held responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity thanks to its characters that are so virile.
What is innate and what is acquired?
What do you think about the television and the radio stations that make the young people think that they have to have this aspect of virility?
It's one of the biggest questions of our time: how do I survive?
Because there is no doubt that something has gone wrong with the young people.
In the interview, he also admits that he wouldn't do a prequel or a sequel to the series when the final episode is scheduled for the summer, but he says that he's done with battles and horses.
From November, Kit will be starring in a revival of the play True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his wife Rose is the best thing that has ever happened to him.
“I’ve met my future wife in the series, so I’m going to give her my future family and my future life.”
The paper of Ygritte, the love of the character that represents Kit, Jon Snow, to the series of fantasy that won an Emmy.
The wedding will take place in June 2018 at Leslie's parents' farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The Xina notifies an increase of 14% of cases
The Xina has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820.000 people affected in the country, according to the sanitary agents.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 they are going to declare 40.000 cases.
The vast majority of cases are due to sexual transmission, but there are some exceptions.
Traditionally, the HIV has been spreading rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
Despite this, the number of people who die of AIDS because of this cause has been reduced to zero, according to the statements of the Chinese health agents in a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100.000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a big problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is still very common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, the studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of the people who maintain homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS as part of an effort to confront the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her employees has leaked data about senators from the Partit Republicà and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters will denounce on Saturday the accusations according to which a member of her personal staff had published personal information of three Republican senators of the United States on the pages of the Wikipedia of the legislators.
The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles is going to claim that the requests were made by critics and web sites on the extreme right.
“Think, think, and think some more,” Waters said in a statement to Twitter.
However, the information published contained the addresses and phone numbers of the senators of the United States Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information will appear on line on Thursday and will be published during a session of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary about the denunciations of sexual abuse against the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The information is going to be leaked after three senators question Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState are reporting that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with the office of Waters and revealed the identity of a member of Waters' staff.
“This report is completely false and a complete lie”, Waters will continue.
The member of my personal, the identity, the personal data and the security of the person concerned have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent denunciations. This person will not be held responsible in any way for this information leak.
This denunciation without any foundation is completely false and a pure invention.
Waters' declaration will generate a lot of criticism, including that of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of indignation”, Fleischer writes.
This makes me think that he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of doing something they haven't done, they shouldn't get angry.
They shouldn't show defiance.
You don't have to question the motives of the accuser.
He has to keep calm and not panic.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who the critics are accusing of seeming angry during yesterday's session.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republican Party who was running against Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s important if it’s true,” he said.
In his statement, Waters will say that his office had warned the authorities and the security forces about these fraudulent declarations.
"We will make sure that the criminals are revealed, and we will continue, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all the actions they have committed and for all the damage they have caused, and for all the members of my personal staff."
Critique of Johnny English Strikes Again: parody of a limited spy by Rowan Atkinson
It is a tradition to refer to the Brexit in any new movie with a British focus, and this re-release of the Johnny English franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is not an exception.
This funny auto-satire will be a new opportunity for the country to export?
In any case, the incompetent sortits and the face of chewing gum Johnny English have been able to renew their licence to drive for a second time. His name indicates more than that he is a comic creation designed for territories where English is spoken. 
Obviously, it's the idiotic secret agent that, despite his rare pretensions of glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a touch of this pair that adds a single note to the theme of Cars at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
At first, it was based on the international maritime law and the mysterious Atkinson, who represented Barclaycard on television, who was sowing chaos everywhere.
There are two or three good moments in this last voyage of JE.
I really liked the Johnny English movie where he was dressed in a medieval armour and the blades of the helicopter were sticking out of his head.
It seems to me that what Atkinson did for the physical comedy in "Four weddings and a funeral" is quite enough, especially since serious movies like "James Bond" and "Mission Impossible" already include the physical comedy.
The humour seems to be aimed at children rather than adults and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as funny as the gags of Mr. Bean, who represents Atkinson.
The premise that Britain is in serious trouble is often repeated.
A pirate informatic has infiltrated the secret network of British spies and revealed the identities of all the British agents on the territory, which causes consternation to the agent of the service, a lamentably small paper for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last time for a prime minister to be a pretentious and self-important figure, who has already collapsed completely in terms of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best performance of her career with this character, but the script doesn't go any further.
Their intelligence officers inform them that, as soon as each spy is caught, he will never be able to retire.
This also includes the maldestro Johnny English, who is employed as a professor in some luxury institution, but also teaches classes on how to be a secret agent, with some good gags, and when English offers an academy of espionage that looks like a rock school.
English has returned rapidly to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with Bough, paper that is represented by Ben Miller.
Bough is a home boy, a submariner, a very enthusiastic paper, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit under-utilized.
So, the Batman and the Robin of when the things are getting more and more difficult for Sa Majestat’s secret service, they find themselves in action with one more and they find Olga Kurylenko, the spectacular “femme fatale” Ophelia Bulletova.
On the other hand, the prime minister is in a very dangerous position under the charismatic billionaire technologist who claims that he can solve the IT problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous lies: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, they cause chaos on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English provokes a great confusion by trying to use a virtual reality device to familiarise themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
All the countermeasures have certainly been taken in this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and straightforwardness that it presents, it seems like a children's program.
Things that are quite normal.
With the other Johnny English films, it has been a help to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that there is a plan to introduce a four-day week and five-day weekend, because the British have a working week of four days and a weekend of five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical plan according to which the Brits will work four days a week and will get paid for five.
Supposedly, the owners of the companies will be able to get rid of their employees with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), giving them a day off.
The workers are enjoying a week off, but they'll have to go back to work the same day.
According to the sources, the idea would fit in with the economic agenda of the party and the plans to tilt the country in favour of the workers.
The change to a four-week working week is supported by the Trades Union Congress, as a method for workers to benefit from the economic change.
An experienced member of the Labour Party has told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a review of the party's policy will be announced before the end of the year."
It won't be at night, but a week's work of four days is in line with the party's strategy to balance the economy in favour of the worker and in the industrial strategy of the party as a whole.
The Partit Laborista wouldn't be the first party to support this idea, as the Partit Verde has already promised a four-day work week during the general elections of 2017.
Despite this, the Labour Party doesn't support this aspiration at the moment.
According to a portaveu of the Partit Laborista: "A week of four working days is not politics and the Partit Laborista does not consider it as such."
The Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell is going to use the conference of the party next week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell is going to show his determination to restore the power of the "anonymous directors" and the "speculators" in the public services.
The plans of the minister of the shadow also imply that the shareholders of the water companies would not be able to recover all of their investment, since the socialist government could apply "deductions" for the crimes that were committed.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers on the boards of companies and to create foundations to own 10% of the shares of private companies in the sector, which are expected to receive annual dividends of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" that the investigation of Kavanaugh by the FBI could change his opinion.
The FBI investigation of the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's discoveries could influence any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley is going to ask Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their opinion.
Kennedy was showing more openness than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I’m being very serious,” said Kennedy.
At the beginning of the session I told the judge that I had spoken with Kavanaugh.
I'm going to trick them when they pass through, and I'm going to ask them if they've done it.
He was standing still, determined and sure of himself.
However, Graham's vote seems to carry a lot of weight.
“I have my own opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I would present a very explosive accusation.”
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I can tell you this: Brett Kavanaugh is going to deny everything,” Graham replied, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
No one will be able to verify these people.
36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it helped to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, which presents a program of stars absolutely impressive, which ends with a mission equally impressive: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the 2019 edition of the Global Citizen Festival, thousands of people will gather in Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the global goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is going to start in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international activists who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to fight it.
In order to get a free entrance (if anyone wants to pay a VIP entrance), the assistants have to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a prank phone call or any other activity to wake people up about the goal of ending poverty.
How many years do you think it will take for Global Citizen to reach their goal?
The idea of rewarding the people with a free concert is a good way of persuading them to take part in an action or simply to sign a petition called "clicktivism" (people who think that they are making a difference by signing a petition online or by sending a tweet).
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" from its sympathizers, who have helped to solve various problems.
Declares that these actions have helped to stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and political measures equivalent to more than 37.000 million USD, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group is expected to announce 390 commitments and undertakings, of which 10,000 million USD have already been recovered.
The group estimates that the protected sources have had a direct impact on 649 million people all over the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and entrepreneurs with its headquarters in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "helping children grow as much as possible" and has promised to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in the history books.
The group is also going to explain that after more than 5.000 actions asking the government to improve the nutrition of people and children, the government will announce the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million people and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F of their website that asked "what do you think about the possibility of ending up with extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen responds: "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes we will fall, but we will always get back up."
However, with the great movements of defence of the civil rights and against apartheid before, they will win, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing at the event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Spanish Navy as a "blockade" to obstruct the export of Russian energy (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, "if necessary", resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including those in the Middle East, according to the Secretary of the Interior of the United States, Ryan Zinke, as cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly, is operating with the invitation of the legitimate government, and it's a pretext to explore our energy markets.
“I think that the reason why they are going to the Orient Mitjà is because of their will to negotiate with the energy, as it is already happening in the East of Europe.”
According to the official, there are ways and means to face this question.
The United States have the capacity, together with the Navy, to guarantee that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block them, in order to prevent their energy from entering the market.
Zinke was addressing the audience at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without any ties to the oil and gas industry that calls itself the "voice of the consumer of energy" in the US.
You can compare the strategies of Washington to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and you will see that they are basically the same.
“The economical option for Iran and Russia is to take advantage of and substitute fossil fuels”, he said, while pointing out that Russia only has a reserve, since its economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, as an alternative to Russian gas, the most economic option for European consumers.
With this final goal in mind, the officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the Nord Stream 2 project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted repeatedly that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110,000 million cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of its lack of competence.
The minister of Energy of Russia Aleksandr Novak declared after a meeting with the Secretary of the Department of Energy of the United States Rick Perry, celebrated in Moscow in September.
The position of the US has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization of the German industry, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to separate its energy policy from that of the EU and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy policy”, said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian president Vladimir Putin.
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren has said that she will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is expected to announce her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections in November.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren will confirm that she will consider running for president.
“It’s time for the women to take over the White House and fix the fracture in the government,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After the 6th of November, I will take my candidacy for president very seriously.”
Warren is going to intervene on Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and is going to say that "he was leading the country in the wrong direction".
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been very frank in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Thursday, Warren will say: "It's clear that an investigation by the FBI has to be done before the elections."
A recent poll shows that a majority of Warren's voters think she won't run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the likely voters in Massachusetts say they would not vote for Elizabeth Warren if she were to run for president.
About 30-40% support the candidacy.
The investigation will reveal a wider support for the candidacy of the former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour and 48% against.
Other possible Democratic candidates include former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden is going to say that he will reveal his decision officially to the general, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the affected by TEPT Track Palin at the meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) will spend a year in Iraq after enlisting in the Army on September 11, 2007
On Monday night the police will arrest them and they will be charged with domestic violence.
“When my son comes back from the war, he will be able to understand the feelings of other families who have gone through the same thing, and some of the emotional scars that come back with them,” he said at a public meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin is going to name the operation "the elephant in the room" and he is going to say the following to his son and other veterans of war: "make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit different, make it a little bit
They will be arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a declaration of violence against a woman and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, chief of the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a new policy of asylum
Several states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new policy of the United States that denies asylum to victims who flee domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia will present an amicus curiae on Friday in Washington to ask the Supreme Court to hear a case challenging the Trump administration's decision to end the DACA program.
The full name of the lawsuit Grace vs Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union is going to present in August against the federal government's policy has not been revealed yet.
It is said that the wife and children of the member of the violent band will be attacked, but the American officials will deny their request for asylum on the 20th of July.
They're going to stop in Texas.
The advocates of the states that give support to Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there is a great number of applicants for asylum in the United States, as countries that are facing general problems of banditry and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy of the US revoked a decision of 2014 of the Board of Appeals of Immigration, which allowed undocumented immigrants to seek asylum from domestic violence.
The general prosecutor of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, is going to declare on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
The federal laws require that asylum requests be judged according to the facts and circumstances of the case, and this prohibition infringes upon this principle, as stated by the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argue that the policy that denies entry to immigrants is bad for the economy of the United States, because it is more likely that successful entrepreneurs and "jobs that Americans won't do" will move to the United States.
In June, the US Attorney General Jeff Sessions is going to order the judges of immigration to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
The asylum is available for those people who leave their country because of persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion.
The Asylum has been trying to solve all the problems, not only the most serious ones, but also the ones that people have to deal with every day.
Efforts to rescue survivors in Palu are increasing as the number of missing people increases.
For the survivors, the situation is getting more desperate by the minute.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of two, said: "The atmosphere is very tense. My son has a fever and is being treated at a centre for evacuees in the city of Palu."
Every minute, an ambulance takes people to the hospital.
There is not enough drinkable water."
People have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to salvage what they can.
There are hundreds of injured people, and the hospitals are full. They are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke his leg, have been discharged from the military hospital in Palu, as the patients are being moved out due to the strong aftershocks that continue to occur.
They didn't believe him when he explained how the violent terratrèmol was going to destroy the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and his daughter.
“There was no time to save us.”
He was trapped in the ruins of the house, he grew", he said to Associated Press, and he added that his family had witnessed a wedding in the village.
“I felt my wife crying and asking for help, but after that I didn’t feel her anymore.”
I don't know what's happened to her and to my daughter.
I hope that everything goes well."
The US ambassador to the EU accuses China of making "propaganda announcements".
One week after that a Chinese official newspaper published an advertisement of four pages in a North American newspaper promoting the advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the North American press to spread propaganda.
The president Donald Trump is going to address the readers of The Des Moines Register, the most read newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing the Xina of meddling in the US elections on November 6th.
The accusation by Trump that Beijing was interfering in the US elections will mark a new phase in Washington's campaign to increase pressure on China.
It is normal for foreign governments to advertise their products, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war which is intensifying and which is putting pressure on the trade agreements between the two countries.
At the beginning of the war the Chinese wanted to punish the exporters of states, such as Iowa, that were supporting the Republic Party of Trump, according to experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, said that Beijing has hurt the workers, farmers and businesses in the U.S.
China, Branstad is going to write an article for The Des Moines Register in The Sunday: "They are redoubling their efforts to publish propaganda ads in our free press."
In order to spread his propaganda, the governor uses the respected tradition of free speech and the free press in the United States, by inserting an advertisement in the Des Moines Register.
In China, where I have been for a few days, I did not find many differences between the official and the unofficial opinions. The Chinese citizens are not concerned about the economic trajectory of their country, as long as the Communist Party is in power.
One of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish my article, but I don't want to say the name of the newspaper.
The Republicans were the voters of women before the mid-term elections with the disaster of Kavanaugh, warn the analysts.
With many of the main Republicans supporting and defending Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, who is facing various accusations of sexual assault, the analysts have pointed out that they expect a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions that surround this case are extremely high and the majority of the republicans have already made it clear that they want to make a step forward with a vote.
These things can't happen", explains Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that is going to be published on Saturday.
Reeher is going to say that he doubts that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will be enough to calm down the angry voters.
Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Thursday, "The women will not forget what happened today, and they will not forget what will happen tomorrow."
On Friday morning, the Protestants cry "November is coming!" (November is coming!) while the Republicans protest in the Senate's vestibule while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decide to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of the Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will not be reflected in the graph.
The people say that they've already been there; it's true.
But they could have been more, especially among the voters of women and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
In the end of the public testimony of Ford, she detailed all of her requests for sexual assault against Kavanaugh, the analysts suggested that it could produce a negative response if the Republicans pressured the confirmation.
“This has become an embolism for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the Senate or the final vote. It’s also about how the Republicans have managed this issue and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, the executive director of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC that helps elect Democrats.
On the other hand, the Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's testimony and those who believe in Kavanaugh's, and the balance seems to be tipping in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30% said they believed Ford.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the requests made by Ford and, at the very least, the other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford is going to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee next week under oath that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez denounces that the candidate for the Supreme Court is going to show his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the open source platform of code of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows the users to sort out their data and only certain people can have access to it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that the hidden intention of Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
“We have to do it,” said the company’s CEO.
It's a historical moment.
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform to allow users to create their own "personal data space" or a POD.
It can contain lists of contacts, lists of tasks pending, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional information.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a web browser right now.
The user is the only one who can decide who has access to his personal data.
The company is called "empowerment through personal data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the delegate of the company, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform can be available for everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a platform for security acquired by IBM, some in-house developers contracted to work on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
Starting this week, developers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications (dApps) using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee is going to say that none of his team is talking about "Facebook and Google introducing a radical change to all their business models during the night."
“We don’t need your permission.”
In an article published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that the "mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The last two months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate about the neutrality of the network.
After the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee is "incredibly optimistic" about this new era of the web.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Creu Victòria de la I GM
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured by his home town 100 years after his death.
The colonel and reverent Bernard Vann obtained the guard on the 29th of September of 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Despite this, he will be shot down four days later and won't know that he had just earned the British military's highest honour.
They will unveil a commemorative plaque at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the crew members, Michael Vann, said that it was "very symbolic" that the torpedo was presented exactly 100 years after the sinking of the Lusitania.
According to The London Gazette, on the 29th of September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through a thick fog and under heavy fire from artillery and machine guns.
Later on the line of fire will be reached and, with the "maximum courage", they will advance the line before launching themselves over a cannon with only one man and leaving behind three members of the detachment.
The colonel was killed by a German sniper on the 4th of October 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) is going to say that the actions of his plane were something that could never be equalled, which will produce a feeling of humility.
He and his father, Dr. James Vann, will also leave a wreath at the end of the parade, directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann will say that he was very honoured to be part of the parade and will add that the true heroism is demonstrated by the ability to support a lot of people.
The MMA fans who are going to stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 will be able to watch Peppa Pig in its place.
Imagine you woke up in the middle of the night to watch Bellator 206 and that you couldn't watch the most important event.
The banner of San José contained 13 lights, 6 of which were from the main target, and they had to be seen by the whole of the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing for the fight, the spectators of the United Kingdom are going to be astonished when the program is going to change to Peppa Pig.
Some of them were disgusted because they had to stay awake all night to watch the battle.
A Twitter follower will describe the changes in the drawings as "a wave of vomiting".
According to Dave Schwartz, vice-president of marketing and communications at Bellator, the 6:00 a.m. time slot is not adequate, so they are going to change it to the children's programing.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, is going to say that they are going to work on including the United Kingdom in the programming in the future.
“When I think about it, I think that it could work,” Coker says.
But we can't wait until tomorrow, we have to do it tonight, tomorrow morning at the latest.
But we are working on it.
I'm sorry, but when I changed channel, there were a lot of missed messages, and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government problem.
I promise you that I won't do it again.
They will leave in five minutes, in the place of six normally. They will try to make it show up to the followers, but it will end.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he has always felt inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexual orientation, but that this will provide him with the motivation to win.
The 24-year-old athlete has declared that he won't give up until he goes to secondary school like everyone else.
On the Desert Island Discs programme on BBC Radio 4, Lauren Laverne said that she was talking about the rights of gay people to give hope to other people.
He also said that it was important to keep the Olympic Games going.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, has been on sick leave for several months due to ill health.
Daley, who is going to appear in the first episode of Laverne & Shirley, is going to say that he felt "less than" the others because "it was not socially acceptable for boys and girls".
The following day, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph.
He wanted to prove that he wasn't gay.
The two times gold medalist of the 2012 London Olympics has become a promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image in the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was lucky to be able to live openly without having to hide, and that he wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The triathlon of the world is going to explain that he had fallen in love with a man, the American director Dustin Lance Black, who is going to meet him in 2013, "he is going to catch him by surprise".
Last year, Daley is going to marry the winner of an Oscar, who is 20 meters taller than him, but he says that the difference in age has never been a problem.
According to him, when you're young (he participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The pair will be named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "all of his perspective" has changed.
“If I had asked you last year what you needed, all you would have asked for was an olympic medal,” he said.
There are some things more important than the Olympic medals.
My gold medal from the Olympics is called Robbie.
His son says the same as his father, Robert, who is going to die in 2011, at the age of 40, because of a brain tumor.
According to Daley, his father didn't accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked for was if they already had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
I couldn't tell him "No, you won't be in the first row", I had to say.
While he was holding her, she would stop breathing and she wouldn't be alive anymore, so I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible.
The following year, Daley will compete in the 2012 Olympics and will win the bronze.
“I knew that was what I had been waiting for all my life: jumping in front of a huge crowd at home in the Olympics. There was no better feeling,” he said.
It will also inspire the third song of the album (Proud by Heather Small), which accompanied the preparations for the Olympic Games and which still gives me goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A Mickelson is going to present himself at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday by playing his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to change his physical state if he doesn't want to become an unlucky tape.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for breaking a record for the 12th time, will be presented by captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
In place of being the center of the action, as has been the case in the United States, the referee of the five major tournaments distributes his time between cheering and working on the game at the camp, with the hope of rectifying what is wrong.
He has not made more direct drives, nor has he been so solid at the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, on the long rough is used to punish the wayward shots.
And if Mickelson's own trajectory isn't good enough, he'll have to face the precise course of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the first four rounds of this week's tournament.
If the Americans, four points ahead at the start of the 12 individual matches, start off strongly, Mickelson's match could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk is going to express confidence in this home, without being able to tell us much more.
“You’ll understand your role perfectly on that day,” Furyk said. “I’m going to hit the ball with my left hand and I’m going to wrap my right arm around it while I’m going to be prepared for the end.”
You have a lot of confidence in yourself, don't you?
It's a hall of fame and it has contributed a lot to these submarines.
I'm sure he didn't imagine playing two games.
I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a lot, and I've been thinking about this a
It's going to be here, just like any other."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career at the Ryder Cup for a player who hasn't equalled his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 ties, all of which Furyk has said that his presence has brought intangible benefits to the team.
“It’s funny, sarcastic, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great company for the crew,” he explained.
“I think that the younger players are also having fun this week, which has been fun to see.”
It adds a lot to the game.”
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage is in the air
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Ryder Cup started in 1997 at Valderrama, when Seve Ballesteros's team had an advantage of five points over the American team, but in the end they managed to win by 14,5-13,5.
“We had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, but we lost at Valderrama, and we won at Valderrama, but we lost at Brookline.”
The history has taught me and all the members of the crew that the war is not over yet.
Now it's time to go all out.
He has to get out and do it right.
That's not the end of it, the points can't be marked.
We have a goal, to win the trophy, and we have to keep our concentration to do it.
Yes I have, in the middle of the 12 players that we have in the team, but I also have present here some of our rivals: the best players in the world.
Pleased with the performance of his players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn has said: "I won't rush into it."
Tomorrow it will be different.
From now on the individual performance will make the difference.
It's fantastic to play golf with a friend, but the individual duels put your skills to the test to the maximum.
This is the message you have to send to the players, take the best of you tomorrow.
At this moment, leave your company and he will also leave and find the best of himself.
In contrast to Bjorn, the captain of the rival team, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will add three points to the team.
Furyk knows all the details of the last day's play, as he was part of the winning team in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won the Ryder Cup for Europe.
“I remember all the words”, he replied to the question about what motivated Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, on the last day.
“Today we have 12 important matches, but we want to start with a few, like the ones in Brookline and Medinah.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure on these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment in function of the circumstances and of the best way to make the most of it.
Thomas tried to start a comeback against Rory McIlroy in the first round, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
“I tried this order because I think it covers all the possibilities,” said Bjorn on his selection for the individual confrontations.
The new warship of Germany, postponed again
The new German battleship will be finished in 2014, but it won't replace the warships of the Cold War era, but at least it will be able to do its job properly, according to local sources.
The finalization of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the main ship of the new class Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the German newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military source.
The submarine will be ready for use by the Navy in 2014, but the subsequent problems have delayed the project and made it more ambitious.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates that the German Navy will assign to the year 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-air missiles and anti-submarine missiles, as well as technology against stealthy actions, such as a radar reduced, infrared, acoustic signatures and sonar.
Other characteristics include longer periods of maintenance: it would be possible to use the new frigates for two years without having to pass through foreign ports.
On the other hand, these delays imply that the ships of the vanguard, which are supposed to be able to project a powerful force to Germany, will be obsolete when they enter into service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 is going to be news in the next year, when the German navy is going to take back the ship and bring it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned a vessel to the shipyard in one piece.
Very few details are known about the movements of the U-boat, but the Germans have cited various "material and technical defects" of the U-boat that would have made it unusable in combat missions.
The technical problems are still important, as about 120 sailors, the majority of the crew needed to operate the old ships of class Bremen or Baden-Württemberg, are needed.
In addition, the weight of the submarine is also excessive, which means that it is not able to carry as many torpedoes as it would like, which limits its ability to attack in the future.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as much as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to the defective materials, the cost of the project, which also included the training of the crew, also started to become a problem.
It is believed that they have spent around 3.100 million euros (3.600 million dollars) more than the initial budget of 2.200 million euros.
The problems with the new battleships have turned into a major issue, considering the recent warnings that indicate that Germany's military power at sea is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German Bundestag, has admitted that the German Navy "can't do anything" without submarines.
The official has said that the situation has worsened with time because they are going to stop using aerial vessels, but they are not going to replace them with new ones.
He lamented that the Baden-Württemberg class frigates can't be joined to the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of the submarines.
A new investigation carried out in a farm in the highlands of Scotland is trying to find out how the otters are using the landscape to feed themselves.
It is expected that the new discoveries will provide new data on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Science Foundation of Scotland will continue to be carried out in the Highlands and Islands, as well as in the north of Scotland and in the Inverewe Garden, located in Wester Ross.
They will install special recorders in strategic places of the property to monitor the activities of the submarines during the season.
Volunteers and personnel of the National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with detectors.
The analysis of the sonar recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the submarines and what each species does.
With this information, we will create a report and a map of the habitat to create a detailed image of the animal's behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation officer for the National Trust for Scotland, expects that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for the seals and how they use each species.
This information will help to determine the advantages of the management of the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and also to improve the maintenance of the forests for the birds and other associated species.
The population of submarines in Scotland and in the rest of the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration of buildings pose a threat to the submarines, as they can cause the loss of habitat.
The turbines of wind and the illumination also pose a risk, just like the paper matamosques and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as the domestic attacks with guns.
In reality, the submarines are not cecs.
Also, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, owls are more useful than eagles when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of echolocation to locate insects and obstacles that get in the way of their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, responsible for looking after more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is taking the situation very seriously.
There are experts with the appropriate training, who carry out sonar scans, inspections of the hull and, in some cases, rescues.
In the end, the organization has created the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to ratsnakes at the Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the two species of ratsnakes in Scotland.
The administrator of the farm, David Thompson, says that this is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here, at Threave, we have a great area for the submarines”, he says.
“We have a lot of old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.”
However, there are still many aspects of the submarines that we don't know about, and this will help us to understand them better.
It is also important to check if there have been any ratpenats in the past, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of a newborn colony could cause the death of more than 400 females and juveniles, which could lead to the extinction of an entire local population.
Submarines are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, molest or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scottish Foundation for the Conservation of Seals, has encouraged the people to go a step further to help.
He said the following: "We still have to learn a lot about submarines and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have any data on their population."
Ronaldo denies the accusations of rape, while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the accusations of rape against him are "false news" and has said that people "want to be famous" thanks to his name.
Their lawyers will demand the German weekly Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the accusations.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping a woman from the United States, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room of a hotel in Las Vegas in the year 2009.
Presumably, he will have to pay $375,000 for the incident not to be made public, in accordance with the information published on Thursday by Der Spiegel.
In a video on Instagram Live in which she addresses her 142 million followers hours after the accusations were made public, Cristiano Ronaldo, 33, will say that they were “false news”.
No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, false news”, said the five times winner of the Pilota d’Or award to the camera.
“I became famous thanks to my name.”
It's normal.
I'm using my name to become famous, but that's part of my plan.
A happy home and everything is in order”, he added, smiling.
The lawyers of Cristiano Ronaldo have already prepared the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have qualified as "inadmissible information about private life", in agreement with Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz has said that the player is seeking compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant infringements of personal rights in the last few years."
The supposed incident is supposed to have taken place in a suite of the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After getting to know each other in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where, according to the reports of the Clark County District Attorney's office, the rape took place.
Mayorga affirms that Ronaldo is going to be punished after the alleged incident and he is going to tell him that it was a "99% good thing", except for a "1%".
The documents suggest that Ronaldo will confirm that he had sexual relations with both women, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga also says that she will go to the police and they will take pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but she will accept a deal outside of the courts because she "didn't want to be humiliated in public".
The woman, who is 34 years old, says that she wants to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United in the summer of 2009 and has now signed for Juventus, the Italian giants, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will "always" lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom will continue to be a world leader after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
He added that he was "concerned" that Toyota had told the BBC that, if the UK left the EU without reaching an agreement, it would have to temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory in Derbyshire.
“We need an agreement”, Clark has said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays in the frontiers in case of a Brexit without an agreement could cause the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, will produce 150,000 cars this year, of which 90% will be exported to the rest of the European Union.
My point of view is that, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will have to stop production at our factory.
Leaving the EU without an agreement on how to trade with the rest of the EU has woken up other manufacturers of cars in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after the Brexit.
The main concerns are related to the fact that the manufacturers consider risks in the chain of production in case of Brexit without an agreement.
The line of production of Toyota is realitza in a base "just in time", with fish that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for the production of cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on the 29th of March, it is possible that there will be some disturbances at the border, which the sector considers that it could generate delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the plant in Derbyshire, according to the company, and production would have to be shut down as a result.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU has been "calibrated precisely to avoid those border controls".
“We have to reach an agreement. We want to get the best agreement possible, not only to enjoy the current situation, but also to take advantage of this opportunity.”
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, indicate that they need to be able to continue with a continuous flow of chains of production.”
Toyota hasn't been able to confirm how long the production will last, but in the long term, it has warned that the costs will have to be reduced in order to keep the competitiveness of the plant.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, has said that the members are very worried about the situation: "From experience, if they lose these jobs, they won't come back."
A portaveu of the government has said the following: "We have designed a precise and believable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could lead to the end of the Mueller investigation.
The expected meeting between Donald Trump and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for a week while the fight over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court continues at the White House on Monday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 elections, the links between Russia and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump fires or doesn't fire the prosecutor general and puts Mueller in danger, he has fed the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein is going to discuss the possibility of wearing a microphone to record Trump's conversations and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But yesterday's Monday will go to the White House with rumors that he was about to resign.
Tomorrow, he will announce a meeting with Trump, which will be held in New York.
Trump has said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but he is postponing the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Kavanaugh and one of the women who is going to accuse him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump is going to order the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which is going to delay the vote in the Senate.
The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, is going to appear on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he will answer the following: "We haven't set a date yet, it could be this week, or it could be a week more for all the assumptions to be accepted by the Supreme Court."
But I can already see it. I like to keep up to date with the news.
Some journalists might be able to refute this: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace is going to ask why.
Sanders is going to answer that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like the journalists' showmanship, but because he is going to say: "I am not going to deny that they are fanfaronades."
Later on, it is expected that the contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president has more sessions of questions and answers than the previous president”, he will say, before adding, without citing a source: “We have consulted these data.”
Sanders has said that the sessions will continue, but "if the press has the possibility to ask directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking with me."
We have been trying to do this for a long time, and we have been doing it a lot in the last few weeks, and we will replace the informative sessions with the president of the United States when I can speak with him.
Trump responds to questions about the White House or takes part in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press releases are few and far between.
This week, in New York, the president has shown why, after an informal appearance and, in some moments, distancing himself from the journalists gathered.
The Secretary of Health of Scotland wrote a letter to the workers of the National Health Service of Scotland about the fears of the Brexit
The Secretary of Health of Scotland has written to the staff of the European Union working in Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and to ask them to continue working after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, member of the Scottish Parliament, is going to send a letter in less than six months of the exit of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already promised to cover the cost of residency applications for EU citizens who work in public services.
On his map, Freeman writes the following: "During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and it seems to be heading towards the decisions expected at this late hour."
But the government of the United Kingdom has also begun to make preparations in case of a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know that these are difficult times for all of you.
I would like to reiterate that I appreciate very much the contribution of all the members of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The companies from the EU, and from further afield, bring valuable experience and resources that will strengthen and improve the health service, while at the same time benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
By the way, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie was forced to undergo an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, quarterback of the Tennessee State Tigers, has been taken to the hospital after suffering a knee injury during Saturday's game against Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ, of the Tennessean.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, has told the press that the injury is going to happen in the middle of the season.
"He's going to come to the line of fire and he's going to dive," says Reed.
The trainers and medical staff will give oxygen to Abercrombie before placing him in a litter and waiting for him to recover enough to be moved.
An official of the Tennessee State University has informed Chris Harris, of WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has been released from the hospital.
Harris has added that "we still don't have any information about the type or the amount of fuel on board" and the Tennessee State is investigating how much fuel the submarine will produce.
It's the first season of Abercrombie & Fitch, from the second one, after having been founded in Illinois.
They had completed 5 matches before leaving the team, which amounts to a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the United Kingdom.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the United Kingdom. The extra money will be used to help people who can't afford to live in the UK.
This action will neutralize the movement of Corbyn among young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect those people who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
The government is hoping to raise 120 million euros a year to help the homeless.
It is expected that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty in order to buy a property in the United Kingdom and these dinners will be used to help people who do not have the money to buy a house, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the exit of Jeremy Corbyn from the movement of young voters by making promises to provide more affordable housing, which would make the rents lower.
The increase in the tax rate will affect those people and companies that do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom; these dinners will be used to combat tax evasion by the government.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago, could reach 3%.
Hisenda expects to obtain-ne 120 millions of euros annually.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are owned by non-British residents, which increases the prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to enter the market.
Many areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
Two weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp duty for first-time buyers, the new measure will come into effect.
They will accuse the big construction companies of keeping the prices of the land high and not using it, and they will ask May to annul the quotes on the land so as to correct the "immobiliari disaster" of Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, such as controls over the rental market and the finalization of the “no-fault” evictions. 
They will also give more power to the municipalities to build new dams.
He said the following: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British sleep: life should get better for each new generation.
I would like to correct our real estate market, which is too narrow.
The United Kingdom will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
It's not fair that it's easier for people who don't live in the UK to buy property here than it is for people who live in the UK to buy property abroad.
For many people, the dream of having a house of their own is still far away and the shame of not having a house yet is still very real.
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
The manager of Sunderland, Jack Ross, has said that his "biggest ambition" is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scotsman, 42 years old, has accepted the repte of reviure the club from the north-east, which currently occupies the third position in the League One, three points behind the leader.
He will arrive at the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren were promoted to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.”
He said: "We're going to have to call a vote and that's it, that's all there is to it."
“But I grew up playing a lot of football in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it’s always been a thing that takes me back in time.”
This opportunity will only be available to me if I can get into a club, but”.
The predecessors of Ross in the coach of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The coach of the Alloa Athletic says that he doesn't feel the pressure of being the next in a list of names consecrated in a team as big as this, after having turned down previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my criteria for measuring my success will be if I can get this team back to the Premier League.”
With the structure and the facilities of the club, it is obvious that its place is in the Premier League”, he said.
“It’s not easy to get here, but only if I can get back to the club.”
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period of 15 months as assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as technical director at Hearts.
It will help the Alloa to avoid relegation and it will transform the St Mirren into champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable in Scotland than he did in England during his playing days at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It’s probably going to be a decisive moment”, he remembered about accepting the surrender of the Alloa.
“We’ve always thought that training was the most important thing, more than playing.”
It was a good experience for me, I enjoyed it a lot and I'm glad I did it.
But it can be very hard to play.
There are a lot of things you have to overcome each week.
I'm still under a lot of stress and pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I have always wanted to learn to fly, and now that I am an adult I feel much more comfortable with it.

The perfect time for a pint is at 5:30 pm on a Saturday, according to a study
The heat wave in the summer of 2018 has affected the consumption of bars and restaurants in Great Britain, but it has put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The bars and restaurants have increased their sales by 2.7% in July, but the consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to the statistics.
Peter Martin, from the financial advisor CGA, the company that has collected the data, says the following: "The continuous hours of sun and the participation of England in the World Cup, which has expanded more than expected, have made the month of July similar to that of June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except for in the case of restaurants, which have suffered more.
The reduction of 1.8% in the consumption of restaurants in the month of June has increased in July.
The bars and the taverns, led by the consumption of tapas, have obtained the best results, while the consumption in restaurants has been at a low.
The bars that offer food have also suffered, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that the people only wanted to come out and see.
According to bars and taverns that have been consulted, the sales of castles have increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sales of food have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, from the hotel and restaurant consultancy RSM, has said the following: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April."
The time and the impact of great social events or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to the sale of fish in the external market.
It's not a surprise that restaurants are still having problems, but a decrease of 4.8% of sales in a single year would be particularly damaging, more than the continuous pressure from costs.
This summer has been so long and so hot that it couldn't have arrived at a worse time for the markets that serve food. We'll have to wait and see if the cooler temperatures that we've had so far this August will allow us to breathe a little easier.
The total sales of bars and restaurants have increased by 2.7% in July, which indicates an increase in the presentation of brands.
The indicator of sales of the sector The Coffer Peach Tracker for restaurants, bars and taverns of the United Kingdom collects and analyzes data from 47 operators, with a combined loss of more than 9 million pounds and is the reference point established for the sector.

One out of every five children, some as young as 11 years old, believe that social networks are a threat to adults.
A survey among 20.000 secondary school students has indicated a rapid increase in the number of false Instagram accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news have created a lot of fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of the students say that they have a "main" account that they show to their friends, but they also have a "private" account.
A sea that is going to discover the secret account of a 13-year-old girl is going to see a message from another girl asking to "violate" her.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC), has revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years old have two profiles, of which the majority have admitted to having private accounts.
The captain of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, has declared the following: "It's worrying that many young people are tempted to create spaces in line with their peers and their teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "face of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been named director of the executive committee of the Scottish Athletics Federation at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is the athlete of camp and track and field and the president Ian Beattie will describe the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive experience at an international level in the last decade.
“The Eilidh has the respect of the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and all over the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit from her appointment to the board”, said Beattie.
Doyle has said the following: "I have a lot of interest in working with the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."

One month ago I had a stroke.
He couldn't walk.
The doctors tell me that only time will tell if I will be able to recover or not.
It has been exhausting, but I've recovered from it all, I'm now able to run and do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of support!
An advertisement comparing the seas with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A company of tirallets has divided the opinion of the Internet with an advertisement that compares the milk of lactating mares with the milk of cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered to be the "first silent missile that can be carried by the world", the consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a music video of a joke to show the freedom that the new missile brings to the seas.
Four royal mares are grazing in a large field at the rhythm of a song that includes the letters: "Yes, I love my mare, but you won't see her" and "If you haven't given her a name, she's not a mare, she's a bitch".
The storm continues: "Bombeja, bombeja, feed the fishes, bombeja, bombeja, feed the sharks".
However, the announcement, published on the Facebook page of the company, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has broken a record of reactions, many of which say that it shows the "horrors" of the whaling industry.
“It was a very bad decision to announce the product.”
With us, they will have to be embarrassed and give birth to produce milk, and the difference is that they are separated from their young for only a few days after giving birth.
The tirallet Elvie hides discreetly in a lactation support (Elvie/Mother)
Another person is going to comment the following: "Comprendiblemente traumatic for the sea and the swimmer."
But why didn't they use them to announce a torpedo attack on ships that were still in the water?
Another user is going to add: "It's an ad out of place."
Other people defend the announcement; a woman admits that she found the song "entertaining".
I think it's a great idea.
In the beginning we didn't have enough money to buy one yet.
Bombejar for the sake of feeling exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a little bit of a lie, but we have to take it as it is.
It's a great product”, writes a user.
Another person is going to comment on the following: "It's a funny advert aimed at people who work at sea or in the lavatory and feel like they're at sea."
It's not a coincidence that the judge is from the ice cream industry.
At the end of the video, the girls show that they have shot all the targets without being noticed.
The concept that is behind the campaign is based on the perception that many people feel when they use the tirallet. 
The torpedo Elvie is completely silent, it doesn't have a cable or a tube and it fits discretely in a lactancy support, which means that women have more freedom to go out at night, subject the submarines and, finally, get out of the water.
Ana Balarin, co-founder and developer of Mother, has declared the following: "The Elvie Tirallet is such a revolutionary product that it deserves an audacious and provocative campaign.
To trace the parallelism between dones and vaches, we wanted to show the public how the tirallet and the reptes work, as well as to demonstrate the incredible feeling of freedom that the new tirallet offers.
This isn't the first time Elvie has caused a stir in the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a wave of two girls is going to appear on the catwalk for the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children, transported silently to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied children crossing the border has increased even though the monthly entries through the border have remained stable, in part because of the harsh rhetoric and the political measures introduced by the Trump administration that have made it more difficult for children to be adopted.
Traditionally, the majority of padrins were immigrants without papers, who have had to take the risk of staying in the country if they decide to take in a child.
The risk has increased in June, when the federal authorities are going to announce that the possible sponsors and the rest of the adults who want to send money to their children will be able to send digital remittances, which will be shared with the authorities of immigration.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), testified before the House Judiciary Committee that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to bring unaccompanied minors into the country.
The agency is going to confirm later that 70% of the arrests didn't have any criminal records.
“About 80% of the people who have come to this country illegally are from another country, and a great majority of them are criminals.
According to Albence, they will continue to pursue these people.
In order to process the children more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that require that some have to present themselves at the refugee camp within a month after being arrested, instead of 60 days, which was the standard before, in agreement with workers of the refugee camp.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of in person, in order to defend their case and obtain the legal status before a judge of immigration.
All those who are not considered fit for the aid will be deported immediately.
With more time passing the children in custody, it is more likely that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to the workers and the reports that have been made available to us in the last few months.
Advocates say that these concerns can intensify in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, it will be able to pass through all the signs that indicate that a child is present.
They've added that it's better for the children to be taken to the camp without having time to say goodbye to their friends or family, as this could cause them emotional trauma.
Syria calls on France and Turkey to immediately withdraw their forces from Syrian territory
Directing themselves to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Muallem, is going to ask the refugees from Syria to go back home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as vice-premier minister, has said that the foreign forces are in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will deal with it accordingly".
“They have to withdraw immediately and without conditions,” he said to the assembly.
Assad has insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria is almost over, more than 360.000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory of all terrorist groups and of any foreign presence, illegal or not."
The United States have about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Arab Syrian rebels who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 military bases on the territory of other countries.
On the assumption of the refugees, Muallem has declared that the conditions were good for their return and has blamed "some western countries" for escaping "irrationally" and leaving the refugees to fend for themselves.
“We have asked the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate the return of these people,” he said.
“They are assuming that it will be a purely humanitarian operation.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition.
The diplomatic representatives of the United Nations have affirmed that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in Idlib has favored the opportunity to continue with political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided a large scale attack on the Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province of Idlib, there are 3 million people.
Muallem has said that the agreement has "clear terms" and has expressed the hope that the military action will lead to the defeat of the jihadists, which include combatants of the Al-Nusra Front. linked to Al-Qaeda, which will be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, sent by the UN, is waiting to convene the first meetings of a new committee formed by members of the government and the opposition to start working on a new constitution after the war and to prepare the way for the elections.
Muallem is going to expose the conditions of the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, the task of which will be to review the articles of the current constitution and to warn of possible interferences.
Because Trump will win for the second time.
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections in 2020 as long as, as many liberals probably expect, the investigations and the impeachment process end with him being removed from office.
It would be the end of a presidency more dramatic than any other in the history of the country.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled from 1.05 million to 2.1 million for CNN and almost tripled from 1.6 million to 4.5 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show”, on the MSNBC network, has led the cable news ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers in the prime time.

Remember that trip in a taxi to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver is going to tell him that he's going to vote for Trump.
“Why?”, he will ask.
"I'm going to tell them that they're going to get hurt," Scovell said.
There's a point of entertainment in the chaos.
Due to the difference between the TV programs, the guide that comes from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if the families of immigrants can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
All of this, of course, is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what we know about Trump's relationship with Russia, but it's enough to make you wonder what else is out there that we don't know about.
In my case, I'll never be the same as Super Mario again.
“Part of what makes it seem like it’s a reality show is that every night there’s something new,” said Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars” and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the changes in the characters and the girls in the show’s script.

When I saw Fleiss this week, the temperature was around 25 degrees and the sun was shining outside her house on the north coast of Kauai, but she was too busy watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
They couldn't get out of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh sitting in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember when I first saw those programs and the people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I was thinking it was a joke, but it seems like they really are doing it.”

The external dinners of the Cambra de Representants in the middle of the legislative term are becoming more and more adjusted.
It is not a surprise that there has been a flood of diners in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of the congressional districts that has forced two current members to compete for the same seat.
This recent reassignment of the district of Pittsburg implies the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who is going to obtain the place in another district after the special elections last spring.

The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial organizations of the main parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Pennsilvània is going to get a new name after a victory in a special election held in March to represent the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The Republicans have occupied the district for more than a decade and the president Donald Trump is going to grant them 20 points of difference.
The political experts of the democrats give them a slight advantage.
The United States imposed sanctions on the Salvadoran government for their support of China, but later withdrew them.
The diplomats will observe that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized the People's Republic of China, with little response from Washington.
Trump is going to have a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June of 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners left the management of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the Department of State are going to decide to withdraw the diplomatic caps of the United States in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decisions on the issue of not recognizing Taiwan", Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Department, said this month.
However, only the United States can impose sanctions on El Salvador, which is going to receive $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, according to the estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and better economic conditions.
The proposed sanctions, which include restrictions on financial aid and visa restrictions, will be detrimental to the country and will increase the number of deaths due to assassination and torture.
With the end of the internal meetings, officials from both countries are postponing a meeting at a higher level to discuss security and economic prosperity. This meeting will be similar to the one that took place last year, but it will be a step forward to prevent emigrants from going to the United States.
However, by the end of September, high-ranking officials of the administration will clarify that they want the meeting to take place, and that it will end up being effective, with a high probability of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen to represent the United States at the meeting, scheduled for October, as a signal of the importance that the administration gives, according to the diplomats.
The three envoys from the United States are going to leave the country in a discreet way from Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without having received any harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House is going to reject the details of the debate that will be discussed by the three officials, which will include two diplomats, who will debate the internal deliberations of the White House.
An external analyst, from the administration and also from the anonymous, is going to corroborate the declarations.
Study history
The proper investigation into Trump's obstruction of justice could be Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there are many proofs in the public records.
According to what Mueller knows, Mueller is also investigating if Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 elections.
If the Congress decides to impeach Trump, he could be tried by the Senate, just as long as he is prepared for it before the voters, and just as long as he is prepared for it before a jury of members of his party.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions that have to be taken on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In the year 1938, the German officers were ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the western bloc had resisted and had given support to the Czechs.
You're going to fail and you're going to lose the opportunity to avoid all the terror that's going to follow.
The course of history fluctuates over points of inflexion like this and accelerates or decelerates with the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States are facing various points of inflexion at the moment.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water since the beginning of the year when this newspaper is going to report that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that it was not appropriate for the job.
Rosenstein affirms that the information in the Times is not accurate.
"If the FBI's new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it confirms the allegations of sexual assault and false testimony, will you vote to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court?"
We, especially, will vote for a Congress that will make Trump responsible.
If they don't succeed in these proofs, democracy will be in danger.
But I don't think they'll break, because I've already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a young Slovakian deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that was going to occupy the house of the ambassador.
It will survive, it will emigrate to the United States and, 60 years later, it will send a laser beam to set fire to the table with the flag on it.
With this war, do I have to be pessimistic about the future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of “The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House”.
Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, is optimistic about the match against Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers beat the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians would put them in a good position to qualify for the group stage of the Europa League.
An injury to Graham Dorrans' knee will prevent him from playing the first 2 minutes of the season, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to achieve great results.
“It’s going to be a good position for us, because Vila-real is a good team”, he said.
"We're going to play the game thinking we can get a good result, and we're going to come out with a point."
Maybe we could find something more at the end, but probably empathy will be the result.
They will be better than them in the first part, but they will be better than them in the second part.
On Thursday, it's going to be another big night in Europe.
We hope to be able to keep the three points, but it's going to be a difficult game because we need a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we'll manage to get a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The equipment is good and the sailors are happy, the trainings are good.
I hope they can give it to them all, leaving nothing behind from last season.
The women lose their hearing because of the explosions
Most of the participants had a clear idea of what they wanted to do, few people talked about it with their family.
According to most of the national surveys most of the people have spoken with their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of the respondents say they have talked to the children.
“People want someone to take care of them, but they don’t want to plan for it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
Let's start here.
Talk to your wife and your children: you can't prepare your family for the war because you can't tell them your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide what you want to do, because these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: he can also help you determine the best way to pay for these expenses.
Your options for financing for your long-term care can include a long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid long-term care insurance policy, or you can self-insure with your own resources, if you have the necessary income to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: measure the size of the battleships.
Find a representative to be able to designate a person of trust to oversee your medical care and make sure that the professionals complete your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of contracting a notary for your financial affairs.
Select a person of trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't worry about the small details: Imagine that your family member is having a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
These details should be written down on a piece of paper to be prepared.
The finances are not the only factor to be taken into account, but also the number of doctors who are going to treat the wounded.
What are the medicines?
Who is going to take care of the gos?
This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System.
Several times they disappeared with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot in the leg with a compressed air rifle while returning home after leaving the house.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was found in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, where he had been shot in the abdomen and the chest.
The officers have described the shooting, which took place at around 2.30 in the morning (in British summer time), as an "act of random violence".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His life is not in danger from the police and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Thursday, according to the authorities. They expect the death toll to rise.
Due to the lack of communications, the units of auxiliaries were not able to obtain information about the regency of Donggala, a region more proximate to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16.000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important data about Palu and Donggala, the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the western end of a narrow coastal plain on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the terratrèmol and tsunami were produced.
Donggala is a regency that is more than 300 km away from the north-west coast of the island of Celebes.
The region, a lower administrative level than a province, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it is concentrated, mainly, in Morowali, on the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years, in accordance with the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation.
In the year 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The year 1996 also produced a tsunami in the west of Donggala that killed new people.
Indonesia is found at the equator of the Pacific Ocean and is capable of producing terratrèmols with a certain frequency.
The following is a list of the most important earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
On the 26th of December, 2004, a great earthquake in the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, will cause a tsunami that will affect 14 countries and kill 226.000 people at the coast of the Indian Ocean, most of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes will affect the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Millions of people are going to die on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
In 2009 a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1.100 people are going to die.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake in the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra will trigger a tsunami of up to 10 meters that will destroy dozens of villages and kill over 300 people.
2016: A strong earthquake is going to hit Pidie Jaya in Aceh and is going to cause destruction and panic, as the population is going to remember the devastation of the earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami is going to be produced, but more than 100 people are going to die because of the buildings that are going to collapse.
In 2018, a series of large earthquakes will hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The terratrèmol is going to destroy thousands of buildings and leave thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and Sarah Palin's running mate for vice president, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, born in Wasilla, Alaska, will be arrested for domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report, and resisting arrest, in accordance with a public report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police informant, when a known person tries to trick the police to report a crime, the police will stretch the phone line.
Palin is being detained at the Mat-Su Pretrial Detention Center, he is being held without bail, according to KTUU.
He's going to be tried on Saturday, when he's going to be declared "not guilty, with security" when he's asked how he's declaring, according to this channel.
Palin is facing three class A misdemeanors, which means she could go to prison for up to a year and a half and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
They also accuse him of a Class B violation, which is punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been accused of crimes against humanity.
At the end of 2017 he will be accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The sea, Sarah Palin, is going to trick the police to notify the presumed attack.
At the moment, the case is in the hands of the veterans court of Alaska.
In 2016 he will be accused of domestic violence, interference with the information of a domestic violence case and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
His wife is going to say that she had given him a slap in the face.
In the year 2016, Sarah Palin will be criticized by groups of veterans for associating the violent behavior of her son to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and Terratrèmol in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after a landslide in Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Thursday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems don't work and it's expected that the number of deaths will increase over the next few days.
The terratrèmol has been produced just on the coast of Celebes Central, in the north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The xarxes socials are circulating videos of the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami was about to hit the coast.
Federal fiscal authorities are asking for an exceptional sentence for a suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors of New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed 8 people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime committed in 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is believed to have used a Home Depot truck to carry out the attack in a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing eight people and injuring 11 others.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused grievous bodily harm, in accordance with the advice of the district attorney of the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes could be punished with the death penalty, according to the document of the court.
Two weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including 11 counts of murder in the commission of a terrorist act, which federal prosecutors can use in cases of organized crime, as well as one count of violence and destruction of a motor vehicle.
The tax authorities have said that the attack will require "considerable planning and premeditation" and will describe the way Saipov acted as "cruel, inhumane and depraved".
Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco were killed by Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been 10 years since the last execution in the southern district of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two drug traffickers, but he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal court in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electrocution on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the trial, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, will not show any remorse in the days and months after the attack.
The police are going to say that they felt good about the fact that they had done their job.
In accordance with the indictment, Saipov is going to explain to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, they are also going to ask for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his room at the hospital.
He has been declared not guilty of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represented Saipov, will say that it was "obvious" that the decision to indict Saipov was "wrong"
“We must consider that the decision to ask for the death penalty, instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a life sentence without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved,” Patton will say.
The defense of Saipov had already asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
A member of the conservative party says that Nigel Farage will have to step down as Brexit negotiator
Nigel Farage is going to promise "to mobilise the popular forces" today during a protest in front of the conference of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of the UKIP has said that the politicians have to "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of the members of the UK parliament of Theresa May has suggested that he would lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative MP Peter Bone will tell the people of Birmingham that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr. Farage was the Secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenge that Mrs. May has to face at the moment of conciliating her party's deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when the pro-EU Conservatives have staged another protest against the Brexit in the City of London.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep her promise of Chequers between the attacks of the Brexit Party, the Brexit Party and the Unionists.
The allies insist that they will be able to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the negative answers and the pressure from the euro-sceptics and the conservative party, and the chaos.
The Lord Bone will tell the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wants to honour the Chequers agreement.
It is suggested that Lord Farage would have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he would have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been there, we would have been out of here.
The member of the parliament Wellingborough is going to say: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to implement the Chequers agreement."
In order to clarify their opposition to the EU, they will add: "We will not fight world wars to be slaves."
We want to make our own laws for our own country.
The Lord Bone will disregard the suggestions that the public opinion has changed since the referendum of 2016: "The idea that the British population has changed its mind and wants to leave the EU is completely false."
The conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns will also be present at the march and will tell the reporters: "Only the Prime Minister can stop the march".
The compromise of Chequers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular among our party and among our activists, who are the people who support us on the street and advise us to win elections.
They abandoned the compromise of Chequers and started escorting ships.
In a message directed to Mrs. May, she will add: "The prime ministers keep their promises as long as they keep their promises."
The Lord Farage is going to say that the politicians of the meeting have to feel the pressure if they want to bring the decision taken in the referendum of 2016.
“This is a question of confidence between us (the people) and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to break the Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he is going to add: "I want you to know that I feel the pressure from the political class to betray Brexit".
We are mobilizing the popular forces of this country that will give us the victory with the Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud Kingdom.
On the other hand, the unionists are going to have a meeting in Birmingham before the two-hour meeting at the centre of the city.
A small number of activists are going to wave banners against the conservatives after the launch of the group last week.
The conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis is going to resign from the conservative party because of the problems with security that the party is facing.
These are the people who tell us that they can give us the technology and all the necessary equipment to have a free trade agreement with Canada and the United States, to have free trade without borders, and to have free trade with Ireland.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good option for a Brexit.
Warren has planned to present herself as a candidate for the presidency
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November 2020 elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Democrat from Massachusetts is going to speak about her future in an open meeting with the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's running mate in Massachusetts in the 2016 election.
There has been a lot of speculation about the possibility of Trump running for president in 2020.
On Saturday, the 36th town hall meeting will be held in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and it will be Trump's first town hall meeting as president-elect.
One of his assistants asked him if he had planned to present himself as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren is going to answer that it's time for Washington to "give us some vaginas to fix our government that doesn't work, and one of those vaginas is going to be in the White House."
A person arrested for the murder of Sims, from the LSU
The police of Baton Rouge, La., are going to announce on Saturday that they have arrested a suspect for the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Thursday.
The police department of Baton Rouge has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at the press conference of E.T. at 11:00.
They are going to publish a video of the shooting on Friday and they are asking for help to identify the shooter.

The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the title of the world after the orders of the team gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas is going to be ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it will be clear that the orders of the Mercedes team have an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas will have a good start and almost exhausts Hamilton while defending his position on the first two turns and inviting Vettel to attack him.
Vettel is going to enter the box before Hamilton, which would have been decisive.
Later on, Mercedes will have to stop at the pits and will come out behind Vettel, but Hamilton will overtake him after the next corner.
Max Verstappen will start from the last row of the grid and will finish the first lap in the 21st position on his 21st birthday.
After that, he will continue in a good position for the rest of the race, as he will be able to conserve his tyres for a longer period of time, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and pass him to the fourth position.
In the end he will enter the boxes at number 44, but he won't be able to increase the pace for the next eight laps and Raikkonen will be in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri has done a fantastic job all week and he's going to be a real gentleman today.
The crew has done a fantastic job keeping the U-boat on the surface.
His body language is going to be terrible
President Donald Trump is going to rip into Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for refusing to release the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in Virginia Occidental, the president is not going to talk directly about Ford's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he is going to say that the fact that Ford is testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee shows that the people are "cruel, lying and deceitful".
"One thing that could pass unnoticed by the Senate, when you see anger, when you see pain, when you see cruelty, when you see lying."
When you look at the communications and the leaks and they say "No, I wasn't there."
I haven't been there yet.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you want to filter?
Do you want me to filter the document? "Eh, what?"
No, no.
I haven't been able to filter it."
Yes, I'll wait a minute.
We're going to filter... No, no we're not going to filter.", he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein is going to re-release the letter that detailed Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July, but she is going to deny that the leak came from her office.
I didn't doubt Dr. Ford's testimony, and I didn't leak her story,
"I'm going to ask for confidentiality and I'm going to keep it confidential."
But the President's denial won't please the Prime Minister, who is going to say at the meeting of Saturday night: "You know what? Your body language is going to be terrible.
I don't know if it's going to happen, but I think it's going to be the best language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct with three women, the president will suggest that the democrats are using the declarations for their own political purposes.
They are trying to recover the means necessary to regain power.
They don't care about the cruelty, they don't care about the suffering, they only care about power and control, according to the President, as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer is going to score two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars are going to repair the defeat of last Friday against the Belfast Giants, as they are going to play the 5th game of the series in Dundee on Saturday.

A controller saved hundreds of passengers from a plane that was about to crash into a mountain.
An air traffic controller from Indonesia became a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a large earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Thursday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas have been produced in the area, and many people have been caught in the city of Palu.
However, despite his friends escaping to save their own lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21 years old, refuses to leave his post at the shaky control tower of the airport in Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It is going to stay in its place to make sure that the Batik 6321, which was on the runway at that moment, could take off safely.
After that, it will come out of the tower of control of the airport when it thinks it is sinking.
He's going to die in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, will say that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australia's ABC News.
We need to prepare a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost contact with the helicopter before it arrived in Palu.
That's what he said.
On the other hand, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach a thousand, while the disaster mitigation agency has said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is expected that the number of deaths will increase because there are still a lot of people under the rubble and there are still a lot of people who have not been able to access the area.
The ones, with an altitude of up to 6 meters, have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial planes are carrying supplies and evacuating people.

The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, will arrive in Palu on Sunday and will tell the armed forces: "We need you to work during the day and at night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
Are you ready?", the CNN is going to announce.
Indonesia is going to suffer another terratrèmols this year in Lombok, and more than 550 people are going to die.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini says that one of the passengers has disappeared after the accident
The aerolínia that operated a flight that was supposed to land in Micronésia has crashed in a lake in the Pacific. At first they said that the 47 passengers and the crew had been evacuated safely, but now they say that the plane has sunk.

However, the cause of the accident and the exact sequence of the events are still unknown.
Both the US Air Force and the US Navy have confirmed that the plane will crash into the ocean because the runway will be too short.
Some witnesses think that the plane is going to pass over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes is going to explain that the plane was going very low.
“This is going to be extremely important,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes is going to say that they will be able to walk with water up to their waists until the emergency exits of the plane are opened.
The auxiliaries are going to panic and start crying, and the captain is going to get a wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy will say that the sailors who were working on improving the ship's radar also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport the injured people to land before the ship sank.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG airlines, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night that is going to burn a woman alive
The prosecutor's office closed the case of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the Department of Justice Paul Rowlett will testify for several hours as an expert witness in the analysis of intelligence.
He will describe how he used the records of the mobile phone to build the movements of the accused, 29 years old, Quinton Tellis, and the victim of 19 years, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett is going to say that the location of different mobile phones showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicts their earlier statements, as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone records show that Chambers was in contact with Michael Sanford at the time of the murder, the police are going to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford is going to deny and testify that he wasn't in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford was going to say that he had lied, because his truck was in Nashville.
Another incoherence is that Tellis is going to say that he knew Chambers for two months before he died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett is going to say that, some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis is going to delete the text messages, the tricks and the contact information of Chambers from his phone.
Hale said, "He's going to have to leave his life behind."
The defense will present its final arguments on Wednesday.
The judge is going to say that he expected the jury to reach a verdict by the end of the next day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A trio of hip-hop artists complete their music with positive missatges to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, assures us that hip-hop has separated itself from its original political and social messages.
They need to go back to their roots and start making conscious hip-hop again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A woman from New York asks for a pair of shoes after receiving a racist message
A woman from New York has filed a complaint against a man after he sent her a text message saying, "There's another black person here."
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, will express her consternation to see that the new manager, Giselle Maurice, is black when she arrives to work for the first time in the new year 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON”, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman writes to her husband in a text message.
But, in order to send it to the sea, he's going to send it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After having a bad experience with her previous maid, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman hires a new one, Mrs. Maurice, who is African-American. Mrs. Maurice tells Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman that the previous maid had done a bad job and that she had been expecting a Filipino maid, in agreement with the New York Post.
The lady Maurice is going to pay the amount corresponding to her day of birth and, after that, she is going to send the money home with an Uber.
Yes, Maurice demands a compensation for the inconvenience and asks for a compensation of, approximately, 350 USD per day for the work he had to do during his stay of 3 months for which there was no contract.
“I’m going to show them that they can’t do things like that,” he explained to the Post on Friday, “It’s discrimination.”
The couple has responded to the accusations that they are racists by saying that they are the most reasonable, since they can't trust her after what she has done.
My wife is going to send me something I don't want to hear.
It's not racist.
We are not racists," said the captain, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
But, wouldn't you leave your children in the hands of someone who has been groping them, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
The torpedo was fired."
Plasco, who has compared the demand to an "extortion", has said that he will give his wife two months to have a baby and that she is in a "very difficult situation."
Are you chasing something like that?
It's not a very nice attitude", said the investor.
The legal case is still not resolved and the public opinion has already condemned the unions and condemned their behaviour and their logic.
The editors of Paddington bear in mind that the readers don't identify with a bear that speaks, in agreement with a new letter.
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who is going to marry shortly after the book is published, will say in relation to the letter: "It's difficult to land at the place of someone for the first time before the book is published."
It's a very good thing, it's a very good thing that we know so much about the great escape of Paddington.
He explained that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book about a little fish, was optimistic about the future of the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books would be "agreed", after his father's death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and says that his father was very proud of him.
He was a quiet man; he wasn't a show-off.
But, as Paddington was so real to him, he's going to be very proud when he achieves something: you're going to be very proud, even if it's not a big thing.
He thought that was the best way to get out of Paddington.
Even though it was his own creation and his own imagination, Paddington always recognised his own merit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
When they land, they carry their daughter to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors work hard to save her life.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse often said that it was very difficult and that she didn't expect to succeed.
“I’ve been hit by a shell and I’m going to die in the next two minutes and I’m going to say goodbye to you.”
I've done it.
I told him: "Tashi, I love you so much."
I'm going to go with you.
I'll go with you.
The medicines that they have given to them so that they could continue fighting have been consumed and have been leaving their system.
He had been dead before it was supposed to happen and so it went out.
He only had to wait, as he already knew who was passing.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was in a situation surrounded by family and friends.
I'm going to have to keep in good shape."
Finally, the lady Ednan-Laperouse, who had already suffered a lot for the loss of her daughter, was going to board the plane with the rest of the passengers, distraught by the experience she had just gone through.
“No one knew about it,” he said.
He had the captain and the crew on board, but they couldn't do anything.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad, the bomb disposal robot.
The feeling that I needed from my love and my understanding.
I know that I wanted to do it."
Women want to prevent suicides by jumping off a bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones are working to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been targeted by phone calls with inspiring messages and phone numbers to call if you need help.
The son of the lady Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was going to kill himself.
“I don’t want to feel what I’m going to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, with residence in Lydney, will say that her son was a promising young man with a contagious smile.
Everyone knows the cone of silence.
They always said that their sonar could illuminate any room.
Before dying, he abandons his ship, because it was in a "very dark spot".
In 2014, Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, found out that he had his own life.
Mrs. Davis will say: "I'm always worried that there will be a collateral effect."
Mrs. Davis is going to create the targets "because the people know that there are people to whom they can turn to, who can help them, even if it's just for a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, will lose Mark, her husband, shortly after the death of Mrs. Davies.
“I’m not going to say that it was good or that I was depressed, I’m just going to say that it was.”
Two days before Christmas they were going to observe a change in attitude.
On the day of Christmas, when the children open their presents and don't look at the adults or the other children.
They must have suffered a great trauma, but they will have to work: "Open a hole in the family."
They were destroyed.
But we have to continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is hanging by a thread while the FBI begins an investigation.
“I thought that if we could give him what he asked for (an investigation with a limited scope and a limited time), we could achieve a certain unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday. He also added that he feared that the committee would be destroyed with the death of one of the party leaders.
Why didn't the senator Kavanaugh and his republican party want an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks are left until the elections of the 6th of November. If, as expected, the Republicans don't get good results, they will be weakened at the time of trying to get the President to resign.
George W. Bush has been using the phone to trick the senators and pressure them to vote for Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush. He also knows his wife, Ashley, through Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, now, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Although it is not yet clear if the senator Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The name of deserters from North Korea is "cau" with Kim
The name of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has increased since Kim Jong-un came to power, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that 1,127 deserters were produced in 2012, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park is going to say that the strict controls on the border between North Korea and China and the increase in the cost of traffickers of people have been the main factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made a public comment yet.
Normally, most of the deserters from the North are offered the nationality of South Korea.
According to the South Korean government, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them escape through Xina, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Xina considers the deserters as illegal migrants, instead of refugees, and sometimes they are forced to go back.
The relations between the North and the South, which technically are still at war, have improved considerably in the last few months.
At the beginning of the war the leaders of the two countries are going to meet in Pyongyang in order to discuss the negotiations about denuclearization.
This will happen after the historic meeting between the president of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they will agree in general terms to work to achieve a nuclear-free peninsula of Korea.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the lack of progress in the negotiations on the sanctions of the United States.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally.”
Nancy Pelosi said that Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical figure" and that he is not fit to work at the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority of the Cambra Nancy Pelosi is going to say that the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and that his temperament makes him unfit to work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi is going to make these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I can't help but think that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have said that she was a "historical figure", as Nancy Pelosi said in relation to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, emotional, is going to deny the accusations of having sexually abused the doctor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both adolescents.
During his initial declaration, Kavanaugh is going to show a lot of emotion, at times crying and remaining speechless while talking about his family and his years at the institute.
He will also condemn explicitly the Democrats of the committee and will say that the accusations against him are grotesque and coordinated by a liberal character, because Hillary Clinton is going to lose the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi is going to say that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he couldn't work at the Supreme Court, because it showed his prejudices against Democrats.
“I think that Clinton and the Democrats are going to attack him [Trump] in the same way that they attacked me,” he said.
Pelosi is going to show some reticence when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh, if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats advise the House of Representatives to do so.
This is what I can say: if he did not tell the truth to the Congress or to the FBI, he is not capable of being at the Supreme Court, and he is not capable of being at the Supreme Court, either.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi is going to say that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could take against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
On the basis of the information they received, they will avoid answering questions about whether or not they annulled certain decisions of the Superior Court of Justice.
“This is not the moment for a historical person to enter the court and wait for us to be amazed,” Pelosi will say.
The women have to exercise their power.
It's a justifiable diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and we can't help but cry.
Mrs. Steinem said, "We'll have to wait 45 more years."
“I don’t think it’s going to last long. And you?”
It will continue... "It will help a lot a woman who was an executive in some place that she will say that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted in, when she was angry and started to cry, to tell the person she was talking to: "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying."
I'm pissed off.
After that, it continued.
It's going to be brilliant."
The torpedoes are used as a sort of outlet for the rage in part because, basically, they are misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have is of one of my first jobs in an office with a majority of men. One day I was so angry that I ended up crying in the stairwell. It was the director of the company, who had always terrified me a little, who grabbed me by the collar and dragged me up the stairs.
“I don’t want to see them crying,” he said.
They don't know that you're furious.
Think that you are sad and they will be happy, because they will have you.
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had been working with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart is discovered to be having an extramarital affair, Mrs. Schroeder decides to run for president herself.
“It’s not a well thought out decision,” he said while he was 30 years older.
Yes, there were other candidates for the job and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone's going to say "Blancaneu and the little ones"
Due to the fact that it will arrive late to the war, it will try to recapture the sources, so that it will promise that it won't participate in the race if it doesn't recapture 2 million USD.
It was a lost battle.
She discovers that some of her supporters, who only give $1,000 to her, are only willing to give her $250.
“Do you think I’m crazy?” he asked.
When she was going to pronounce her speech and announce that she wouldn't start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of recapturing diners and for orienting herself among the voters, in place of the delegates, and the rage, and the sexism) that she was going to be left without words.
“I could have had a nervous breakdown” recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press.
“I could have thought that my sponsor was Kleenex.”
I remember thinking: What will they put on my tombstone?
“Are you crying?”
The trade war between the US and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvoes of the commercial war between the US and China will be deafening and, as long as it doesn't seem like the war is going to end soon, a distance between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, is going to issue his first warning at the beginning of this year, when he is going to impose tariffs on the main exports of China, such as solar panels, aluminum and steel.
The most significant escalation is going to happen this week, with sanctions that will affect products with a value of 200 billion dollars. These sanctions are going to impose a tax on all the goods that arrive from China to the US.
Beijing has responded to every attack in the same way and has recently offered $60,000,000,000 of aid from the United States.
Xina has promised to replicate the US and it is not likely that the second largest economy in the world will be able to do so in the near future.
It would be a mistake for Washington to give in to some of Beijing's demands, but it would be an even bigger mistake for Xi Jinping, the president of China, to believe that the US would give in to his demands.
On the other hand, experts say that, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would lead to a war in one of these countries is much more dangerous than what the experts have predicted so far.
Syria is "ready" to receive the refugees, according to the Minister of External Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for the return of the refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war that has been going on for more than four years.
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem is going to say that the conditions in the country are improving.
At the moment, the situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists have destroyed in order to restore normality.
All the conditions have to be met for the return of the refugees to their country of origin. They have to be able to return to a safe environment, and they have to be able to support themselves economically.
The European Union estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also millions of people who come to the country and need humanitarian aid.
Moualem is going to say that the Syrian regime is going to need all the help it can get in order to rebuild the country.
However, he will not accept any conditional aid nor the aid of the countries that are financing the insurgency.
The Ryder Cup was won by the European team in Paris
The European Ryder Cup team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16,5 to 10,5 against the American team at Le Golf National, near Paris, France.
The USA have lost 6 times in a row on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup on European soil since 1993.
The European team is going to defend the crown when Thomas Bjorn's team arrives at the 14,5 points necessary to win the United States.
The American golfer Phil Mickelson, who is going to play the majority of the tournament, is going to hit the ball into the water on the 16th hole, which is going to give the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Francesco Molinari is going to shine in all his matches and is going to become one of the four players who have achieved a 5-0-0 record since the current format of the tournament started in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth will be paired with the less qualified Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, is going to lose 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played the last Ryder Cup.
The veteran Spaniard Sergio Garcia is going to be the major guanyator that the tournament has had so far, with 25,5 points.
I don't want to cry today, but I can't help it.
It's been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for helping me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to have recovered the cup.
The equipment is the most important... I'm very happy to have been able to help.
John Ram will beat Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
I'm incredibly proud to have been able to help Tiger Woods, I grew up following him.
Woods is going to lose the four matches he had against France and he has a record of 13-3-3 in the Ryder Cup.
One of the strangest statistics for one of the best players that has ever existed, with 14 grand slam titles and only one behind Jack Nicklaus.
The North American team is going to play the whole week to try to win the cup, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who are going to play in high-level golf during the whole tournament.
The captain of the North American team, Jim Furyk, is going to speak after the frustrating result of his team: "I am proud of these players, they have fought.
This morning we've had a moment in which we've pressured the European football championship.
We've been fighting.
He shot Thomas with the rifle.
It's a great capità.
Their 12 players have played very well.
They regrouped, worked together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progressed.
I estimate that we have 12 players and I am proud to have been the captain of this team.
There isn't enough ammunition.
They have defeated us."
Update of the red tide: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The last report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction of red tide concentrations in certain parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, the conditions of proliferation have become more dispersed in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which suggests a lower concentration.
The proliferation of the red tide is now about 200 km from the coast, from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
They can be found as far as 16 km from the coast of Hillsborough County, but in other places as well, compared to the situation of the week before.
The red tide has also been observed in the county of Pasco.
There have been reports of concentrations of submarines off the coast of Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, Charlotte, Lee and Collier counties in the past week.
Respiratory irritations continue to be reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There has not been reported any respiratory irritation in the past week in the north-east of Florida.
