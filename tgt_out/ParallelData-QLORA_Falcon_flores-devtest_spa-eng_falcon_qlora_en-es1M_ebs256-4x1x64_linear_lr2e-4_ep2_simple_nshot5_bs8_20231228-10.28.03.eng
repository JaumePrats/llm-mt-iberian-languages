Currently, we have mice that are four months old that were once diabetic and are now not diabetic.
The research is still in its early stages, as indicated by Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and director of the clinical and scientific department of the Canadian Diabetes Association.
Like other experts, he is sceptical about whether diabetes can be cured and points out that these findings are not relevant to those who already have type 1 diabetes.

There is no evidence that any drug is effective in treating the existing infection caused by Ebola, although an experimental vaccine has been shown to be effective in reducing mortality from the disease.
Zmapp, a combination of antibodies, had a promising start in the field, but studies showed that it was less effective than expected in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, the function of Zmapp was to control, i.e. to use it as a base and to compare it with the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the USOC statement and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family create a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and sports can be best served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization, rather than by withdrawing certifications.

The USA Gymnastics and USOC goal is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and enhanced environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an adviser and later for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
He advised Carter on foreign policy in the 1976 elections and later served as national security adviser (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, after Henry Kissinger.
As national security adviser, he assisted President Carter in the management of international affairs, including the Camp David Accords of 1978, the normalization of relations between the United States and China in the late 1970s, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which led to a hostage crisis in Iran, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that is already widely accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils do not, such as their colour and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this bird has a chestnut-coloured upper plumage and a pale or carotenoid lower plumage.
The discovery also helps us to understand the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Given that the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed erector, but do have other feather features (wings and quills), the researchers concluded that the erector is likely the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight but to temperature regulation or as an indicator of temperature.
The experts' assessments were that, even though the tail of a young dinosaur is shown, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.
In the morning of yesterday, in Gaziantep, Turkey, a car bomb killed two police officers and injured more than twenty others.

The sun was found to be governed by the same basic principles as other stars: the only factors that drove its activity within the system were its luminosity and its rotation.
The intensity of light and the rotation combine to calculate the number of Rossby of a star, linked to the plasma flow.
At lower Rossby number, the star's activity is less than its magnetic investment.

He warns that no one can guarantee that any Iraqi action at this point will halt sectarian strife, growing violence or a slide towards chaos.
The report begins with a call for an open debate and a consensus in the United States on Middle East policies.
The report is highly critical of virtually every aspect of the current policy of the executive in Iraq, and calls for an immediate change of direction.
It contains 78 recommendations, the first of which is the adoption of a new initiative before the end of the year with the purpose of protecting Iraq's borders from hostile operations and to restore diplomatic ties with its neighbours.
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who is currently serving as Argentina's senator and first lady, announced last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometres (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will be running for president.
The Teatro Argentino was the place where Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for president; this is the same place where she launched her senate campaign in 2005, representing the province of Buenos Aires.
The issue that gave rise to the debate was the controversy over the budget for relief and reconstruction following Hurricane Katrina, which some conservative fiscal conservatives labelled the "New Orleans Bush Agreement."
The criticisms of the liberals in relation to the reconstruction works focus on the fact that contracts for reconstruction have been awarded to people who, it seems, are Washington officials.

While the programme was largely theoretical, it was designed to simulate observations of the Sagitarius galaxy.
The effect that the group of scientists was hoping for would be caused by the gravitational pull of the dark matter in the galaxy and the light matter in the Milky Way.
The Milky Way influences the galaxy of Sagittarius in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes tides.
The experts concluded that dark matter is affected by itself in the same way as regular matter.
This theory holds that the vast majority of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy is in the form of a halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in South Africa.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant &quot; generated much concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate &quot;.
The doctor believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of the infected were health workers at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom he or she has had close contact.
The percentage of XDR-TB in the total group of TB patients still seems to be low: 6 000 of a total of 333 000 individuals infected at a particular point in time in South Africa.

The police said the body had been there for around a day.
The first cases of the disease during this season were registered towards the end of July.
Pigs are the carriers of the disease, which then migrates to humans via mosquitoes.

The authorities have also guaranteed several million doses of the vaccine to fight against the encephalitis, which will allow the health companies to prepare for the next year.
This year, the scarcity of monetary resources and the low priority given to the disease, compared with other illnesses, have led to delays in the delivery of the vaccine in the historically most vulnerable regions.

While its temperature is not as regular as that of the large caves on our planet, which tend to maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with the deep caves in the ground, as evidenced by the work of Glen Cushing, of the USGS and the University of Northern Arizona, in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a cubicle and insert a pre-printed ballot paper indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the ballot into the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French electoral law lays down the procedures in a fairly strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, so that voters and observers can see that there are no additional votes at the beginning of the count and that only those votes cast by the voters are counted, duly computed and authorized.
The candidates have the right to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, the volunteers count the votes under rigorous supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

Uka's weapon jammed while he was aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, he has lost one eye, and part of his skull was removed and replaced with titanium.
Schneider gave evidence via a virtual link from a United States Air Force base in his country of origin.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the Wednesday competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he finished in "No Terminó la primera carrera", as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the Austrian first-round finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-round finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four slalom skiers sitting down did not complete their races and a total of 45 slalom giant skiers did not qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police were able to recover the laptop and the mobile phone that had been stolen.
The deputy inspector general, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the Superintendent of Police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused presented themselves to the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house at the time of the car crash, none of them suffered injuries.
The driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver of the red Audi TT.
At first, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is under custody awaiting trial and the verdict, any statement by an eyewitness can be questioned, as her image has been widely circulated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the publication of photographs was considered potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted: 'Journalists are apparently walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects'.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, indicated to the journalists that no further comment would be made until the indictment was issued.
According to the information leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were discussed, according to the information available, included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for 10 years once the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the pilot control of pests, the shooters were monitored closely by the supervisors, as the effectiveness of the control was being assessed.
NSW DPI and NPWS have partnered with the NSW Shooters Association to recruit suitable volunteers for the program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge of the NPWS Conservation and Heritage Office, said that comprehensive training and safety training was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
The day before yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it will be the fifth CEP of Martelly.
A presidential commission advised the CEP to resign last month, as part of a series of measures designed to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, which were sometimes violent, were triggered by the fact that elections were not being held, in some cases since 2011.
There have been around 60 cases of iPods with problems of overheating and malfunctioning, which resulted in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry said that it was "truly regrettable" that the report had been delayed.
Mariana was shaken by a magnitude 6.0 earthquake at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency indicated that there was no damage on the Northern Mariana Islands.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
The six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early.
Later, the photographers took over the place of an old lady who needed to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began studying medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and worked at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland from 1959.
Liggins began his research into premature birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation in the baby could be accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that investigators for the government had managed to retrieve the flight recorders from the black box.
The fighters who accompanied Luna also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her."
Dustin O'Rollo said: "Luna was as rare as me; even more so, I think. I love her and miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Since 2008, 8 per cent of those surveyed in the lead-up to the 2010 federal election have been opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, the acting Prime Minister, during the 2010 federal election campaign, said that Australia should become a republic once the Queen's term was over.
Thirty-four per cent of those surveyed share this view and want to see Queen Isabel II as the last Queen of Australia.
At one end of the survey, 29 per cent of people think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other end, 31 per cent think it should never become a republic.
The winner of the gold medal in the 100-metre and 200-metre freestyle events at the Commonwealth Games was disqualified after his physical condition was questioned.
He was not allowed to take painkillers because they are prohibited at the Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people tested the discovery using various hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have provided a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of scientists is to understand how planets, including our own, originated, given that comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the beginning of the year and the beginning of the month and signed a law that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He dismissed the rumours as "political gossip and slander."
He is rumoured to be standing for the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce flight distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise data.
No additional transport will be provided and trains will not stop at Wembley.
Due to the concern over possible lack of transport, the possibility of a closed-door event was considered, without the fanatics of the team.
On Thursday, Science magazine reported on a new species of bird that had been discovered on the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from the University of Princeton, in the United States, and from Uppsala University, in Sweden, have revealed that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was thought to take much longer, because of the mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on all sorts of shapes and forms.
Not only can you hammer and roll it, but you can also stretch it into a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it was used to decorate the illustrations in hand-made books called'manuscripts illuminated'.
This is called pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator of pH using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the juice of the cabbage will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its pH level.
The atom of hydrogen is formed by a proton and an electron. An ion of hydrogen is the result of taking a proton from an electron.
Shake both powders together and, after that, with your clean and wet hands, make a ball.
The reaction between the moisture in your hands and your outer layers will make your hands feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
In some Minoan homes in Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewerage systems were found.
The Romans had public baths with toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to provide us with a much simpler and faster means of transport.
Thanks to it, we have many means of transport today, such as the railway or the car, among others.
Below, there are smaller predators that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
There are many small carnivores (including domestic cats) that feed on small prey species that are much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the big cats that most socialise and live in large groups called prides.
The herds are made up of one to three adult males from the same family group, with up to 30 females and their offspring.
The females are usually very close to each other, which makes them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions have the same behaviour as wolves or dogs, with which they share a remarkable similarity (unlike the other large felines) in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a complete athlete, able to climb (but not very well), swim, leap five times as far as a strong man and pull five times as hard.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not a full-throated roar like the lion's, but rather a series of words spoken in a guttural tone and shouted.
Ocelots are fond of small prey, and will hunt monkeys, rodents, birds and reptiles, which are all much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and hunt prey (prey) by smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and can move very stealthily, and they hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a population) moves away from the main population of which it is a part (for example, if it moves to a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island where it cannot easily return) it will often find itself in a different environment to that which it was used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and, therefore, a different set of characteristics or adaptations is needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed, and they still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As the new population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be able to be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inescapable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they emit).
The food of plants is generated by solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, therefore, nothing could stand in its way, except other Mosasaurs.
Its jaws were long and had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus a second set in the roof of its mouth, so anything that came into contact with it had no chance of escape.
We do not know for sure, but it could have been a viper. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and even could have been a cannibal.
He would also attack any creature that entered the water: even a T. rex was no match for him.
While most of the food we eat today would be familiar to the Romans, they also ate some rather unusual items at their banquets, such as boar, pheasants, snails and even hedgehogs.
Another thing that distinguished the rich from the poor was that the former ate sitting down, while the latter ate standing up.
It is impossible that the recipes of ancient Rome would include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
In short, they had no maize, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
People used to sacrifice to the gods and priests would satisfy their needs by holding ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
In some cases, special towers were built with a pyramid shape, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the Middle East, the house was of little importance in the heat.
The Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just display windows facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland, according to the sagas, and Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, on a journey further west, discovered the island and gave it his name.
Even so, the Eskimos had already inhabited the area at the time of his discovery.
While each country was "Scandinavian," there were marked differences in terms of people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
The reverse side of the document does not contain a map of a treasure, however.
The Declaration of Independence has the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776" written on the back.
Although the author of the document is unknown, it is known that it was written on a large sheet of parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) and rolled up for safekeeping.
The annotation was probably added as a label.
While the D-Day landings, and the subsequent battles, had succeeded in liberating the north of France, the south remained to be won.
His government was in the hands of the Vichy French, who had agreed the peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders rather than fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, Operation Dragoon was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together; in other words, a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin word civitas, which means city or city state, and which, in turn, determines the size of the society.
A state is a precursor to a nation. A culture of civilization is one that is transmitted from generation to generation, one that is durable and one that is homogenous.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilisations in their own right.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, initially, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its sole component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, since it did not have a national executive or judiciary, the power to levy taxes was vested in the states, which often did not cooperate in enforcing all of their laws.
He was not empowered to annul laws or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed to their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago," from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's history goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed by the island registered the name Formosa, which means beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company of a base in south-western Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the indigenous method of grain production, with the use of Chinese labour to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal and western region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this latter region as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control of the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been restored to their original appearance, so that tourists can see how they looked originally.
Machu Picchu was restored to 30 per cent of its original state by 1976 and work continues today.
The most common format for still photography worldwide is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the film era.
Today, it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship was transferred to the formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to calculate the simplest ratio of two integers) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g. the APS group) are either identical or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing for a certain order to be established in the images.
Indicates the most effective position for the central object, which is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states, despite their different languages and customs.
Its power, present everywhere, affected the monarch as well as the people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be reserved for that specific purpose.
The dome of St. Peter's had stood in Rome for more than a millennium, and this concentration of power and money had made many people wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated the general international law and was widely recognized in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain has blocked off entire sectors of the ocean to prevent ships from entering, even neutral ones.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany was expecting a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid a repeat of the situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take up a job with Edison in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his last employer) addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms period, when thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The consequences of this are many, including the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, the emergence of nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
The posts were also open to all male candidates after the Revolution, which allowed the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same applies to the military, which now bases its ranks on the number of bullets fired.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other people in repressed classes in other countries to take up their own revolutions.
Mahoma was interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to visit a cave known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, vividly illustrates the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca lies a cave that is totally cut off from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to find, even if one is sure of its existence. The cave is totally isolated.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains around it. From the inside of this cave, one can see and hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many pyramids built to honour the deceased pharaoh.
The Guiza Necropolis, or "Valley of the Dead," in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids and tombs were built in honour of his wives and family.
The 'upwards arrow' mark is similar to a V and the 'downwards arrow' mark is similar to a square or a rectangle without its bottom edge.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog and pull the bow.
The ascending movement of the arch generates a softer sound, whereas the descending movement is more forceful and sharp.
Feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the marks on the bow have been made for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, aged 11, and Louis Carlos, aged 4) and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open all the windows in their carriage.
In one of the most dramatic moments of the revolution, a participant in the uprising shook the head of a beheaded royal guard in front of the Queen, who was in a panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the costs of the imperialist war of the United States of America in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover the bulk of the interest and principal on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
The super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main source of profit for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context in which they were founded.
The period of history in which these events took place is known as the Middle Ages, between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries (that is, between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around 1500.
The deterministic concept is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of cars, and new techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
The use of automobiles also generates a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in the romanticism, according to scholars such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography moulded people and, with the passage of time, customs and cultures developed that were in harmony with the location of that society and were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is now known as the city of fashion, so was Constantinople known as such in feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicentre of luxury began around 400 BC and extended to around 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, its status declined, especially because the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were more highly valued than goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was then transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style was in the period between the Xth and XIVth centuries.
In the beginning, the way of dressing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, with one of the most significant developments being the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence farming is understood as the production of sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple practice, generally organic, that combines the use of seeds stored from the region with the rotation of crops or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers in the developing world have been subsistence farmers, and this remains the case in many countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality from social standards and provide them with the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a combination of these.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic style, such as dress, gestures and language.
One of the most common mechanisms used to graph the importance of sociability is to analyse the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialised by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild" and some are kept by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the children have suffered from traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or running away.
Some people were raised by animals and some have lived in the wild.
When a child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, it will display behaviours (within its physical capabilities) almost identical to those of the specific animal that raised it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should make the process more interesting and engaging, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new software or the start of a new project.
The andamiaje can be presented in both a real and virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of andamiaje, but also so is the small animated paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is incorporated into the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to grasp alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can see that the family-based system provides a safe environment for these children.
The aim of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The aim of foster care is to cover all the needs that were not met in the foster home.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different facets of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are identified as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of users' reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "long-term relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by reading a person's microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether they are lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate sincerity with accuracy.
Even the ability to interpret human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been proven that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes that variation from the set of variations.
Segregation and recombination are the key to variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of a human, to satisfy its amino acid requirements with the plant resources available to it.
Not doing so can cause serious problems: stunted growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have constituted a more easily accessible source of food, but they are not easily digested by primates such as ourselves, except when cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digested and provide a large number of proteins, which contain all the essential amino acids.
In short, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problems in the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
The interruption of sleep is the intentional waking up during the normal sleep period and then falling asleep again (10-60 minutes).
This can be achieved easily with a watch alarm that is not too loud, but which will wake him up without waking him up completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your stay with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a diuretic) before going to bed, which will force him to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his or her body and mind.
The lower the tension, the greater the potential for peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in our way is our own tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they have been extended by the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In general terms, laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses it all.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy Kundalini (illumination) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga, through the visualization of different deities, can unblock the energy channels, activate the chakras and develop the consciousness of illumination.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
At two years from the end of the war, the allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and would be fought out, through proxy wars, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Because of the Polish defence being broken down by 17 September 1939, their only hope was to retreat and reorganise in the area of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were soon abandoned, when more than 800 000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union entered and formed the fronts of the Belarusian and Ukrainian armies after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken over in Britain, as it did in the other European countries.
Cows were domesticated, for the first time, some 10 000 years ago, in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
In order to obtain their milk, hair, flesh and leather easily, the ancient peoples and tribes began to domesticate them.
The most common method of keeping goats is to keep them in herds, which are often tended by children or adolescents, and are similar to the shepherd.
In England, railways were already in place in the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carriages were made of simple wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and to carry heavier loads than on the somewhat bumpy roads of the day.
The introduction of sleepers to keep the rails in place was a gradual process, but it was not until the 1840s that the idea of iron rails was first mooted.
This practice became a common practice, although the iron wheels on the carriages caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels and, in 1767, iron wheels were used for the first time.
The first form of transport was walking, which the human being began to do two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
The ancestors of the Australopithecus did not walk upright.
While bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more friendly lives with the planet, become part of environmental movements or even become activists and fight to reduce, to some extent, the suffering of the future.
In many cases, it is like treating the symptoms rather than the cause. We should look for the root of the problem and try to eliminate it.
The world has undergone great changes, as a result of technological and scientific advances by humankind, and the problems have intensified because of overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, a few blocks away, for printing.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap copies."
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time in the courtyard of the Independence Hall, on 8 July.
On 6 July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it to be read to his army in New York on 9 July.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are the birds.
Many people do not picture them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have claws and spines, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Almost all computers currently operate on a binary system.
A binary number is a number that can only have two values, 0 and 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is finding a bottle of medicine or cleaning product open.
Read the label for information on the specific first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Insects are parasites in a formal sense, as entomologists use the term.
The word derives from its former relationship with lice, a species that is very well developed for parasitizing humans.
Bedbugs and dust mites are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is around 400 000, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to suffer from ME.
A couple might conclude that raising a child would not be convenient for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The aim of science is to decipher the way in which the world works through the scientific method, which is the guiding principle for most scientific research.
It is not a test, however, it is a trial that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on the classical works; especially, in the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those on science, psychology, were accepted.
As the mastery of the Greek language was lost, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behaviour are decisively determined by internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been found in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free-running period, even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA was a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA of the frog with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is often associated with people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the animal and plant life.
Possible activities in the area include: hunting, fishing, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take photographs and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often meet people who work in the same place they just left.
In this dynamic transport system, everyone is connected to a system of transport based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
The scientists now believe that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of the society and uses the transport systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason for the complaints about the transport systems and why do they break down so often? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent?
The flow of traffic is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of the interactions between them.
It is unfortunately not easy to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to behave in a relatively consistent manner, which allows the traffic flows to be represented in a logical and approximate manner.
In order to graphically illustrate the flow of traffic, three elements were chosen as the most important: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations facilitate both the planning and the design of the devices and the operations of the devices.
The first species to take to the air were insects, which helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, pressing them against their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, only the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera are unable to fold their wings.
Aristarchus of Samos, a Greek astronomer, commented a few millennia ago that the Sun was at the centre of the Solar System.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since the Earth does not perceive its own movement.
The Amazon is the largest river in the world and the second largest in the world in terms of water volume.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water that flows into the world's oceans from rivers, 20 per cent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they could never match the size and sublime technique of the pyramids of Guiza.
The ancient Egyptian town of the New Kingdom was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest in population.
Italian is used in the Vatican for drafting its regulations and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that is spoken daily by most people working in the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is reserved for religious ceremonies.
The total number of citizens living in the Vatican City State who adhere to the Roman Catholic religion is 1.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, as they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It was more similar to the states of matter (solid, liquid, gas and plasma) but at the same time it had the theory that they could be transformed into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are elements such as calcium and potassium, and there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the final point of this sentence could contain billions of them.
The pencil was invented in the 18th century, and it won many friends.
Unfortunately, the use of the pencil has declined since the introduction of new writing methods, and it has lost its status.
Nowadays, people write messages on their computer screens. They have no need to even approach a pencil.
Only time will tell what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls down a hill, and the energy is released in the process.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, i.e. they tend to decay with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the side facing the sun, as the crust is thinner there, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grow older.
These theories analyse what makes some people want certain things and what makes others not want them.
Two theories are very well known: Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour that managers can adopt when they start leading their former colleagues.
Managers in this category have to make decisions that are unpopular with employees, impose disciplinary measures, carry out performance evaluations, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, you have a person who believes that he or she must change everything that has been done in the group and do it his or her way.
In the end, the success or failure of the team is down to the leader.
This kind of behaviour often leads to the leaders of the team being distanced from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their physical team.
They are generally more autonomous than members of a traditional team, as they can meet at different times, for example, that might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a 'virtual team invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of managing and to which each member reports.
What could be a motive for an organization to submit to the process of establishing an organization for learning?
When the resources available are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, the organization may be able to move from a process of teamwork to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
For an organization to be innovative, the leadership must first create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Continuous improvement is a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide empirical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, thus reducing the field of research and increasing its accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour contributes to the research of scientists.
It is well known that several types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumour affect behaviour and cause changes in mental function.
Thanks to the new technologies, we have the possibility of seeing and investigating structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for developing simulation models, which help us to understand mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a branch of computer science that deals with the behaviour, learning and adaptation of intelligent machines.
The research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to queries and consults, facial, handwriting and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to problems in real life.
Artificial intelligence is now used in many sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and the military, as it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is not uncommon for a teacher to want to take her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours. Pupils can observe objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and every year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as a memory book.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even if students begin their blogging experience with a lack of care for grammar and spelling, this often changes when they have an audience.
Because students are the most critical readers, the writer of the blog is trying to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
The blog also requires students to be more understanding of the world around them, and to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The use of blogs &quot; can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet contents, can define their stances in the context of others &apos; writings, and can establish their perspectives on specific topics &quot; (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and galleries that showcase the country's history and present-day culture.
The Niagara Falls are more south and north and the natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
These and other aspects make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that is a surprise to many: more African Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest island in the world and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the islands by the Arabs and has been firmly established there, to a large extent.
The first step of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the route that links Europe with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a ring (make sure it is not too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in your rejection of men and do not fear defending your position (cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century, the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenids, who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but it was abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the area around the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as earthenware, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of other items, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be considered in light of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla trekking excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
For a short trip, you can take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
The fact that it is relatively inaccessible has given "Tombuctú" an image of exotic remoteness.
Although today Timbuktu is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the list of World Heritage sites in danger, as a result of the threat posed by the desert sands.
It was one of the stops on the PBS special "African Wonder Tour," hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts markedly with the rest of the country, which has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which has a different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as a SANParks icon.
As in all South African nature reserves, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also possible to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to all the national parks in South Africa.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of the same name, which is the destination of choice for most tourists.
The Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a bar chart, with the buildings that line the harbour forming a luminous bar.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon Peninsula, which is located on the opposite side.
The city of Hong Kong, on the north coast of China, is the most densely populated area in the world.
This is the site that the British conquerors chose as their own, and it is a convenient place to start looking for traces of the colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, covering 80 km (50 miles) from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans, a forest in India, has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
The forests are not just mangroves, but also contain some of the last remaining trees of the once-impressive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swamp.
The Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife since 1966 and are now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the bus station between districts (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those travelling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), depart between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance.
Almost all districts have the Coaster bus service, which is comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a convenient and comfortable way to travel to places nearby, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River bridge is a structure that spans the river, connecting Oiapoque, in Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m each.
Under the bridge there is a 15-metre-wide space, and although the bridge was completed in August 2011, it was not made available for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that is now the eastern part of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guaraníes, who were the largest indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practising subsistence agriculture.
The region also hosted other aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished for subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "La provincia gigante de Indias," was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the phase of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal identity and culture.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and matches may also be held in other parts of the year.
The website of the Argentine Polo Association will provide information on the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The value of the pound sterling (GBP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands.
There is only one bank on the islands, and it is located in front of the FIC West shop in Stanley.
Sterling is usually accepted in any place on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also accepted in Stanley.
There are no guarantees that the islands will accept credit cards, but you can use British or American money.
It is virtually impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so do so before leaving.
Due to its location south of Ecuador, Montevideo has summer when the northern hemisphere has winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures of +30°C during the summer.
The cold of winter can be deceptive: while temperatures are unlikely to fall below the point of freezing, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" seasons; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild life is still wild, and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the authorities, you must keep at least 100 yards/metres away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/metres from all other animals.
Although they may appear docile, bison, bighorn sheep, elk, bears and many other large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year by not keeping a safe distance from these animals, which are large, wild and potentially dangerous.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other animals, so you should avoid cooking food that smells strongly and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of around 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval engagement when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for a British cruiser. About two hundred Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau independence movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended in the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches in Auckland, which has three main areas.
The North Shore beaches stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south in the North Harbour district of the Pacific Ocean.
The beaches are mostly sand with safe swimming areas and most have pohutukawa trees for shade.
The Waitemata Harbour, the Tamaki Drive beaches, the Mission Bay and St Heliers suburbs in the central Auckland region, are all part of the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family beaches, sometimes very busy, with numerous and varied shops available for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complicated, but rather refreshing and pleasant.
While there is a great variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transporting.
The local water from the tap is perfectly safe for drinking, but if he is worried he can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the idea of "white coffee" to be foreign. A "small black" is an espresso, cappuccino is served with cream (rather than milk) and tea is not served with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year and, there, wounds by any of these causes are rare.
However, please take the advice of the authorities, respect all the signs and heed all the security alerts.
The Portuguese man-of-war is found on the coast from October to April, north of 1770.
Tigers do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them are afraid of people and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where you will find salt-water crocodiles. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers that run north of Rockhampton.
The accommodation booking service gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to stay when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through them.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They can also keep the offer on file in case you need time to think about it, or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any modification or request should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, most of the attendees camp at the event and most of the spectators consider camping to be a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to see the action, then you should arrive early at the campsite to get a good spot for the music.
Please note that, while the music may have finished, in other areas of the festival the music may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special areas for camping, for families with small children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, make sure you know where the cabin is, because the ice-making noise is very annoying for those who are most affected.
During the cruise, you will also have time to visit St. Petersburg, which is visa-free for those who disembark.
Casinos normally make great efforts to maximise the time and money that their customers spend there. They usually have no windows or clocks and the exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special food, drink and entertainment packages to keep guests happy and within the premises.
Some establishments serve free drinks. Although intoxication affects judgment and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or in mountain passes should be prepared for snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy or snow-covered roads, there is little friction, so you cannot drive as you would on a dry road.
During a snowstorm, it can fall so much snow that it will be trapped in no time.
Visibility may be reduced by snow or ice on the windows of the car.
In many countries, the conditions of ice and snow are normal and the traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely to be the biggest attraction for tourists to Africa and the most memorable part of many visitors' experience.
The term safari refers to the popular practice of travelling by land to see the remarkable wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are known to approach vehicles and the standard equipment will allow for good visibility.
Lions, leopards and cheetahs can be shy, so use binoculars to get a better look.
The safari on foot (also known as "walking safari", "safari on foot" or "walking tour") is a walking tour, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with a number of events taking place in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have some complications.
There are different types of travel insurance, but since the end of March, the coverage of most of these coronavirus-based travel insurance policies does not extend until July 2020, which is when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
Most of the tickets for events will cost between JPY 2500 and JPY 130 000, and common passes will cost JPY 7000.
Ironing clothes while they are still damp can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board for guests, even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have a flat iron available, or if you do not want to use one, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat, as it could shrink or even burn.
There are different methods for purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain specific threats.
In some places, you only need to boil water for a minute, in others, you need to boil it for several.
Not all filters are equally effective, and if this is a concern, bottled water with a seal from a certified company should be considered.
It is possible that travellers may encounter animals that are not known in the regions from which they come.
Pests are capable of spoiling food, causing irritation or, in more serious cases, triggering allergic reactions, spreading poison or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases, alone, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals through the use of their force, are not usually included in the category of pests.
The duty-free shop offers an opportunity to acquire, in certain places, products exempt from customs and consumption taxes.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on items such as spirits and tobacco.
The stretch of the Bufalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging and often the most remote section of the Turnpike.
If you do not usually drive on country roads, be careful: there are many steep hills, narrow roads and tight curves.
The speed limits are lower than on the preceding and following sections, and their strict observance is even more important than on any other section.
However, curiously, the signal on the cell phones is much better here than in many other sections of the road like Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are of good quality and, in Bavaria, they are quite tasty and varied, like those in Austria, its neighbour to the south.
Fruit pies, with apples cooked inside, are common all year round, and cherries and plums are available in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. In general, a strong cup of coffee goes well with a slice of cake.
If you fancy a small but tasty cake, try the Berliner, also known as a Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices and served with meat or vegetables.

The stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
While providing greater stability for the rider, they can present problems of safety, as the rider's feet may become entangled in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse takes off.
First of all, most riders use boots with a narrow, pointed toe and a heel that is not too high.
In addition, there are saddles, especially English saddles, with safety bars that allow the leather of the saddle to come away from the structure if the rider is thrown backwards.

Skiing and snowboarding are popular winter sports that involve sliding down a slope on skis or a snowboard.
Skiing is a major activity for many travellers, who are called "skiers" and who plan their holidays around skiing in a specific place.
The idea of skiing is very old, as there are paintings in the caves that show skiers and that date back to around 5,000 BC.

Artisanal products may be catalogued as antiques even if they are newer than goods of a similar nature manufactured in bulk.
Raising reindeer is a fundamental livelihood for the Laplanders and the culture related to this commercial activity is important for many who are engaged in other professions.

The return flow is the flow that reverses the flow of waves that break on the shore, often on a reef or similar structure.
Because of the submarine topography, the return flow is concentrated in certain areas of greater depth and can give rise to a rapid current in the direction of the deep waters.
Most of the deaths occur because of the fatigue caused by trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you have escaped the current, swimming back to shore will be no more difficult than usual.
If you try to reach somewhere where you cannot get back, or if you have the skills and someone has seen you, it is better to wait for rescue.

Finland is an excellent destination for sailing: the "land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.

It is generally a waste of time to look for discounts for first-class or business-class seats on direct flights.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a core group of travellers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, and accordingly charge accordingly.
