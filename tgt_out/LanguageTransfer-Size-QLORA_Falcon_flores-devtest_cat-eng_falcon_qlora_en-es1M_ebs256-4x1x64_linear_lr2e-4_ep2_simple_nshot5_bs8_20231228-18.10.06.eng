It is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly, in office for four years.
The previous provisional electoral council was dissolved last week by the president of the republic, as part of a package of measures designed to move the country forward to new elections.
The Comissió has received the reply from Martelly to the general protests against the regime that have been taking place since October.
The protests, which have sometimes turned violent, have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to be held in 2011.

The possibility of the match being played behind closed doors has been raised, with the fans being kept out.
A new species of owl has been described in the journal Science from the Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden have found that the new species has evolved in only two generations, despite the fact that it was thought to take much longer for such a process to occur, because of the increasing interbreeding between a pin-tailed ground dove, Geospiza pinus, and a pin-tailed ground dove, Geospiza conirostris, in the Galápagos Islands.
You can work in all sorts of ways. You can work in all sorts of ways.
It can cause serious damage or even death.

The pH of a substance can be an indicator of its acidity or alkalinity.
The colour of the col can vary from a light brown to a dark brown (alcalina).
The pH level is the number of hydrogen ions (H) in the substance being analysed.
The ions of hydrogen are protons (the atoms of hydrogen consist of a proton and an electron).
The two poles are joined together and then the wet ends are joined together, and then the dry ends are joined together.

When you are travelling thousands of kilometres, you are using a satellite.
The satellite will be in orbit around the Earth and then the reflection will be almost instantaneous.
The satellite will be sent to the space to be used by the scientists. The scientists will use telescopes to look at the Earth from space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts the light and our vision.

There are many different types of animals, from small ones like mice to large ones like elephants and antelopes.
Finally, there are many small (domestic) pests (such as wasps, hornets, bees, etc.) that are much more abundant than large ones (such as hornets, wasps, bees, etc.).
The secret of their success is the concept of nínxol, a special skill that each of them has and that prevents them from competing with the others.
The lions are the most social of the big cats and live in large groups.
The manades are formed by three adult males and 30 females and calves.
The females are very close, forming a large family of German and French girls.
The bands of leopards and lions are in many ways like the bands of wolves and foxes (although they are not as large as the wolves) and are equally mortal to the prey.
The tiger, an athlete, can climb (although it does not have to), jump, run and swim, and can do so for five days on end with the strength of a human being.
The tiger is of the same genus as the leopard and jaguar. These four are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but more like the roar of a lioness.
If they can, they will hunt mice, rats, snakes and lizards. They will hunt all the small animals that they can.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and hunt the animals that have a strong odour (preses) and leave tracks on the ground.
They can be seen at night, and they can also be seen in a very secretive way. They hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in the environment and then pounce on them.
When a small group of people (a small population) is separated from the main group (for example, by forming a hamlet or a river, or by emigrating to a new island) they often find themselves in a different environment from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a competitor.
The original population has not changed, and they still need the same things as before.
As the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to resemble the other population more and more.
Finally, after a million or so miles or kilometres, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
The process of speciation is the formation of new species. The process is an inevitable consequence of evolution.
The plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, breathe out).
The plants make their food using photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and plant-based materials. The majority of us are plants.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, and it had no competitors except other Mosasaurs.

While the majority of their dishes are familiar to us, the Romans have a few unusual products on their menus; they include snails, crayfish and frogs' legs.
Another difference was that while the poor and the destitute were given the crumbs from the rich man's table, the rich man was given the best cuts.
Romanians who have been in the United States or Asia in the last few years cannot be considered to be at risk.
For example, there is no black pepper, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and so on.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the god.
The gentry sacrificed to the gods and the capellans tried to cover the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a door or a gate and only the monks were allowed to enter.
Sometimes they build special pyramids in the shape of towers, as in the case of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special place for the gods.
In the hot climate of the Orient, housing was not so important.
The major part of the life of the Jewish family took place in the open air.

If you have seen the film National Treasure, you will know that at the back of the Declaration of Independence there is a map of the treasure.
It is not written in stone, though, and you cannot be sure that it is a map of the treasure.
The Declaration of Independence was signed on 4 July 1776 and the text is found at the bottom of the document.
It is not known whether the author of the book &quot; The Invention of the Wheel &quot; (Oxford University Press, 1999) is aware that the first wheel was invented in Mesopotamia in 3500 BC.
It seems that the rating is simply a label.
The disembarkations of the day D and the battles to come will be in the north of France, but the south is still not free.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, which had signed an agreement with the Germans in 1940 and was collaborating with them in the fight against the Soviet Union.
The Allies invaded France on 15 August 1940, and the operation was called "Operation Dragoon."
Only two weeks later, the United States and the French forces liberated the south of France and advanced to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word &quot; civilitzation &quot; is used to describe the civil society, which is to say the civilised society, and the word &quot; civitas &quot; is used to describe the city, which is to say the city or town.
A civilised culture is one that is passed on from one generation to the next, and this is done through culture, which is passed on through the generations, and through cultural dissemination.
The cultures of the minoritaries often disappear without leaving any traces and are not recognized as part of the history of the country.
During the War of Independence, the three states formed a central government, with the Congress as its sole component.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no national executive or judiciary, it had to rely on the authorities of the individual states, which were often small and cooperative.
He did not have the authority to invalidate the laws and regulations between the States.
The Articles needed the unanimous approval of all the States before they could be implemented and the States were so often absent that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and the champions of the FIFA World Cup 2006.
The sports that are most widely known are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, rugby, cycling, ice hockey and Formula 1 motor racing.
The most popular sports in the north are winter sports, and the Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events are very much in evidence.
Japan has 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), which makes it the seventh largest island country in the world.
Because of the group of islands that it is, it is often referred to as an archipelago.
The first Europeans to reach Taiwan were the Portuguese in the 16th century, who called it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south-east of Taiwan, where it began to transform indigenous production practices and recruited Chinese workers for the plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three principal buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the House of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings in our complex have been reconstructed to give the tourists a better idea of how the original buildings looked.
The Machu Picchu site was restored in 1976 and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the format of the film most commonly used in the past was 35 mm, which was the standard in the era of film.
However, the most important thing is that it has a new look, with a new format and new sensors for digital cameras.
The 35 mm format creates, of course, a little confusion, with 36 mm of width and 24 mm of height.
The ratio of the two sides is 3:2.
Many formats are common (the APS family formats, for example) and cost very little.
The rule of thirds, which has been used and abused, is a guideline that creates dynamism and order in an image.
The most important thing is to have the subject in the middle of the picture, with the lines dividing the picture into vertical and horizontal sections.
During this period, European history was dominated by the Church, which was rich and powerful.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united the European states, despite their differences of language and customs.
Its power is omnipresent, affecting both kings and plebeians.
One of the principal principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the Church's financial resources should be used for this purpose.
The head of the Church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this conference will be attended by many people who are interested in the question of whether they can accept this dogma.
Shortly after the outbreak of the war, the Bretons began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved effective, with the military and civilian authorities working together to enforce the law, even though the blockade violated international laws and conventions that had been codified over the past two decades.
The Bretanya is minar the international waters to avoid any vessels entering in full segments, posing a threat to all vessels.
As a reply to this, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine warfare, without restrictions.
During the 1920s, the attitude of the majority of citizens and nations was one of pacifism and non-intervention.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations were determined to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer from the Edison Company in New York.
You will arrive in the United States with four hundred and forty-seven cents, a poem and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the last one he wrote to Thomas Edison).
The Ancient China had a unique way of showing different epochs: each dynasty or family was a different dynasty.
There were also periods of instability in the dynasties, the most famous of which was the 3 Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
In these periods of war, many noble people were killed.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was a period of great bloodshed, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the throne in the great palace at Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one individual.
Even after the Revolution, the occupations were open to all who were willing to work hard and were successful.
This also applies to the military, as they will be based on the relevance of the classes.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the oppressed classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in assuming a life of asceticism and used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to contemplate.
The cave itself, which has survived the passing of time, gives a clear picture of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the top of the mountain range in the north of Mecca, the cave is completely sealed off from the rest of the world.
After all, it is not easy to find them, and even if you do, you have to get to them.
There is no need to go abroad to see the sea, the mountains or the countryside, as there is so much to see and feel in your own country.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians during the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramids ever built in honour of the Pharaoh.
The Gizeh plateau, or "Necropolis of Gizeh", in the Egyptian town of Gizeh, contains various pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), various tombs, various temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Kheops, and many minor pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of the Pharaoh's family and entourage.
The "d'arc cap amunt" is made up of the letter V (ve baixa) and the "d'arc cap avall" is a square or a rectangle with the bottom cut out.

The King and Queen, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and their two young children, Louis-Charles and Marie-Thérèse, were obliged to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a car, you can be surrounded by a multitude of people who are making threats against the King and Queen.
The people will force the king and queen to open the windows of the car completely.
In a certain sense, a member of the crowd will show the cap of a royal guard assassinated in Versailles in front of the Queen.
The costs of the war of conquest of the Philippines by the United States were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
You will have to pay taxes to the United States, to pay for the upkeep of the colonial regime, to pay for the interest on the loans and to pay for the interest on the bonds.
The big guanys derived from the long exploitation of the Filipinos constitute the basic guanys of the imperialism of the United States.
To understand the Templers, you have to understand the context in which they were created.
The period in question is the so-called 'Plena Edat Mitjana' (the Middle Ages), the period of history in Europe from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries (1,000 - 1,300 AD).
The Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages, which ended in the year 1500.
Determinism is a term that is used to describe a wide range of ideas, from the technological to the technological imperative, from the strictest human logic to the most hidden scientific logic, and from the technological to the technological manifestation.
The major themes of the deterministic interpretations of technology development are that technological development follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence and that technology, at the same time, has "side effects" on the societies that are its social environment.
For example, the motor car could be said to be necessary for the development of the roads.
A xarxa de carreteres a tot el país per a un grapat de cotxes no és viable econòmicament, així que s'estan desenvolopant nous mètodes de produccio per a reduir el cost de tenir un cotxe.
The possession of a large number of cars also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the development of new medical techniques for repairing injuries.
The romanticism has a significant cultural component, as determined by the work of Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography gave shape to people, and with the time, customs and cultures related to that geography that were imposed arbitrarily, because they were in harmony with the place and with society.
Paris was known as the capital of fashion in the feudal era, and Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in Europe.
Its reputation as an epicentre of luxury began in the 400s and lasted until the 1100s.
Their status will change during the next 12 years, as the Croats will become more and more important, and the Byzantine species will become less and less valuable.
It is in this moment that the title of capital of fashion is going to move from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was the most popular in the period between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries.
Initially, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture.
Because of the slowness of the canals of communication, the styles can arrive in the West as late as 25 or 30 years of age.
At the end of the day, the Western European style is going to develop its own distinct look, with people using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is the only way to produce food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system that makes use of native plants and other techniques that are relatively simple to apply to maximise yields.
Historically, the majority of the world's population has been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ greatly in age, ethnicity, class, location and gender.
The qualities that determine a subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or a combination of these.
Members of a subculture often distinguish themselves from others by the distinctive style of dress, customs and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few cases of unfortunate infants who are not socialized by adults, due to negligence, neglect or abuse.
Some of these children are known as "salvatges" or "ferals". Some of them have been abandoned by their parents (usually their peers) and in some cases the abandonment was due to the child's intellectual or physical disability.
Children who have been maltreated or traumatised may suffer from nightmares or run away.
Other animals have been created for other purposes; some people say that they have been created for the purpose of being kept in captivity.
The infant, which is created only for animals, presents behaviour (within certain physical limits) that is similar to that of the animal it is created from, such as the ability to reproduce and the lack of interest in humans.
While the learning of the basics would make the learning of the more advanced subjects easier and more interesting, the latter would be a step further.
The theory of the crash course is not a method of learning, but a method of providing a new experience of learning, such as learning to use a new computer programme or starting a new project.
The bastides can be virtual or real: in other words, a professor is a form of bastide, but also a small clip from Microsoft Office.
The virtual classrooms are designed to be internalised in the programme and to show and explain procedures that might have been difficult to understand in the classroom.
Infants are taken into care for different reasons than for neglect or abuse.
No hi ha que ho fan.
I am sure that the system of family reunification is a way of ensuring security for these children.
Our system of reception must provide safe, loving care, a stable education and reliable health care.
The welcome should include all the necessities that were not covered in the house.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication with those of interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet bring about additional dimensions in terms of the focus of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "relationships" are also identified as motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating the reaction of the public to web sites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by observing their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, indicated that people who are not able to hear the King's speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to judge the sincerity of the King's speech.
I suggest that these skills in human behaviour could be shared by animals as well as by children.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: recessive and dominant.
The new mutation is a new genetic variation, and the selection of the new variation eliminates the old one from the pool of genetic material.
The segregation and recombination of the two genetic pools combine to produce a new and different genetic mix in each generation.
It is difficult for a primate to satisfy its digestive system with the amino acids available in the plant world.
There are also serious consequences: stunting growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The resources that are easier to obtain are the proteins and the vegetables, but these are difficult to digest for us humans.
In addition, the animal products (eggs, milk, meat) are difficult to digest, and they provide a great deal of protein, which is essential for the body.
No obstante això, no hauríem de sorprendre'ns pel fet que els nostres avantpassats resolguessin el seu "problema de proteïnes" tal com ho fan avui dia els ximpanzés de la sabana.
The interruption of sleep during the normal period of sleep and waking up at the end of the night (10 - 60 minutes).
It is easy to wake up with a snooze alarm, but it is better to wake up naturally.
If you need to reset the alarm, try putting it on the other side of the room, so that you can reach it from the bed.
Other options include drinking lots of liquids (water or tea, for example) before going to bed, so that one has to get up in the night to go to the toilet.
The amount of internal space a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his or her life.
The lower the blood pressure, the higher the vital force, and the greater the potential for finding satisfaction.
The only thing that stands in the way of our progress is our own negativity and pessimism.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buda, but it is spreading through the love of Mahayana and through many yogic techniques.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of the kundaliní yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With the Kundalini Yoga, the energy kundalini (illuminated energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Tibetan centre of meditation is the yoga of the state. By visualizing various states, the energy channels are activated, the t's are crossed and the i's are dotted.
Germany was the enemy during the Second World War, which will make it easier for the Soviet Union and the United States to work together, and the armistice will bring about a system of processes and cultures, and the two countries will be at peace.
Two years after the end of the war, the Allies were enemies again and the Cold War began.
The 40 years will be prolonged and the training will be carried out in the battlefields of Africa, Asia, Afghanistan and Cuba and in many other places.
On 17 September 1939 the Polish defences had been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise at the bridge over the River Danube.
These plans will become obsolete, as 800,000 Soviet troops will enter and create fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having violated the Riga Treaty, the Pact of Non-Aggression between Poland and the Soviet Union and other international treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is, of course, the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of the navy has been to ensure that your country can maintain its capacity to carry out its own operations and to protect its own interests, while at the same time interfering with the capacity of your enemy to carry out its own operations and to protect its own interests.
One of the most recent examples is the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) campaign to move homes and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Contemporaniament, la marina alemana, usant sobretot submarins, intentava aturar aquest tràfic.
If the Allies had succeeded in conquering Britain, they would have been able to conquer the rest of Europe as well.
It seems that the first domesticated horses were brought to the Zagros mountains by the Parthians, in the 10th century BC.
Cultures and tribes have begun to domesticate them for the sake of convenience, fur, meat and feathers.
Sheep-herding is often done by young people or adolescents, and sheep are often watched over by shepherds.
The trains were built in England in the 16th century.
While the trains consist of only one car, they are able to achieve speeds of up to 200 kilometres per hour and to carry heavier loads.
The crossings will have to be maintained, and the lives of the people there will have to be made more efficient, so that they can be protected by a steel curtain.
This will become a regular practice, but the rails will wear out more quickly on the wagons.
The final step will be to replace the wooden rails with iron ones, which will be introduced in 1767.
The first transport that humans used was walking, which they started doing two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (which is to say, upright man).
Their passports, the Australopithecus, do not normally allow them to travel.
Specialist bipedal fossils have been found in the area, dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, and they could have walked on two legs for up to 7 million years.
They can start to live in a more respectful way with the environment, they can join the environmental movement and they can become activists for reducing the suffering that may exist in the future.
This works only in the case of a symptom and not as a solution to the problem, and we will have to find a solution to the problem itself.
It is evident that the world has changed a great deal because of scientific and technological advances and because of the problems that have arisen as a result of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, he sent a copy of the document to John Hancock and Charles Thompson, the secretary of the Congress, at the printing office of John Dunlap, a few streets away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies are sold, which is the equivalent of "Dunlap's Flies".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon at Independence Hall on 8 July.
If you send a letter to George Washington on 6 July, it will arrive in New York on 9 July and in London on 10 August.
The 25 surviving copies of the Dunlap document are the oldest surviving copies of the original manuscript.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and that they are still living today.
Many people do not see dinosaurs as they are, because they are extinct.
There are many things that are not as they used to be.
They have a tendency to turn around and bite you on the backside, just like a tyrannosaurus.
Most of the computers that we use today are based on information that is codified in binary form.
A binari només pot tenir un de dos valors possibles, és a dir, 0 o 1, i aquests números es coneixen com a dígits binaris o bits, segons l'argot informàtic.
The symptoms may not be immediately evident. Vomiting is a common symptom, but it is not always immediately apparent.
The best indicator of a country's willingness to cooperate is the presence of a recipient of medicines or domestic chemicals.
Please read the instructions on the first aid kit.
The term &quot; insect &quot; is used formally for this group of insects.
This term derives from the fact that the xinxes are insects that are highly adapted to parasitising humans.
The redúvids are generally small, and the xinxes are adapted to the habitatge of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and adult people.
EM is a disease that affects the central nervous system, the medulla oblongata and the optic nerve.
The research has concluded that women have twice the risk (2 times more) of suffering from multiple sclerosis than men.
A woman may decide that having a child is not in her best interests or the best interests of her child.
These are the kind of places where you can adopt a child.
Adoptions are generally finalised so that another family can adopt the child.
The main objective of science is to find out how things work by using the scientific method, which is to say, by using the scientific method.
Experimentation is not the only way to test a hypothesis; questions and observations also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers will focus on the classics and, in particular, the Bible in Latin.
They will accept the opinions of Aristotle on all the assumptions of science, including psychology.
As the Greeks' knowledge of the Orient diminishes, the Orient will become disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that are observed in the physiology and behaviour are often dependent on the presence of endogen cycles and the production of biologically active substances.
The periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to external stimuli, have been documented in the majority of cases, in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological relapses are self-limiting and are followed by a period of inactivity in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase are working on a way to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
Two experiments have been carried out on the DNA of the virus with the use of radio-active phosphorus or radio-active protein.
The mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the gene affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
The mutations in the germinal cell line can be transmitted to other cells, which can cause cancer or death.
The tourism based on the natural environment attracts people interested in visiting the country to enjoy the natural landscape, including the wildlife.
Examples of activities in situ include hunting, fishing, photography, bird-watching and visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people from the small rural towns go to their place of work and pass by other towns where they work.
In this new dynamic, the vehicle is connected to, and supported by, a system of private transport.
Science has shown that this gigantic economy has destroyed one of the established states of the biosphere, which has given support to the evolution of man over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, but everyone has complaints about them.
You will not find many complaints about the quality of the water or the state of the roads in these countries.
Why do the transport systems generate so many complaints? Is it because the engineers are incompetent? Or is it because they are fundamentally flawed?
The Flux of Traffic is the study of the movement of individuals and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Studying the flow of traffic is difficult, as you cannot predict the behaviour of the driver with 100 per cent certainty.
For example, the conductors must be able to maintain a constant level of concentration; otherwise, the flow of traffic would be disrupted and the system would not work.
To represent the flow of traffic better, the three main characteristics of the three main roads are (1) straight, (2) wide and (3) fast.
These relations help with the planning, design and operation of the car parks.
Insects are the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helps them to escape from their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend their own wings.
This provides a great variety of small places to stay, which can be a good alternative to the larger hotels.
Today, the only insects that cannot fly are the wasps and the ephemera.
For miles around, a man called Aristarchus has been saying that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
There are people who thought that the Earth was the centre of the universe, but many others believed that the Sun was the centre of the universe, and that the Earth revolved around the Sun.
That seems reasonable, because we do not have the feeling that the Earth is moving, or do we?
The Amazon is the second longest river in the world and carries 8 times more water than the second longest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the longest river in the world, sometimes running for thousands of miles.
The 20 per cent of the world's water that comes from the Amazon accounts for 80 per cent of the world's rivers.
The Amazon River is the longest river in the world, with a length of 6,387 km and water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The construction of the pyramids with stone will continue for as long as the world lasts, and the technical excellence of the construction of the pyramids at Gizeh will not be surpassed.
The Egyptians were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which had been standing for more than 1,000 years.
The population of the Vatican City is 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
The Italian language is also the language of the majority of the people who live there, while the Latin language is used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican City State are Roman Catholics.
You will have already come across some basic chemical elements, such as silver and gold, in your everyday life, and you will have found them in their natural state and they are relatively easy to extract.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
The four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, all of which can be converted into new substances that form what we call matter.
The alloys are generally a mixture of two or more metals. The periodic table has many elements.
The elements of calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. It is also clear that there are other metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have small quantities of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, on board.
The whole of the Universe is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that billions of atoms are crammed into the final part of this sentence.
The pen will become a good friend to many people as they go about their business.
Unfortunately, with the advent of writing, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status and is used only for minor purposes.
Nowadays, people can write missives on computer screens, without needing a typewriter.
You can ask yourself what will happen when the key is turned.
The bomba de fissión funciona con el principio de que la energía que se necesita para unir un núcleo de moltos protons y neutrons es la que se necesita para unir un núcleo de moltos de neutrons.
Similar to a heavy truck, a new car costs a lot more than a used one.
Some cars have unstable nuclear cores, which means that they tend to break up in a small or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and craters. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The maximum speed is 70 km/h on the straight and 100 km/h on the bends.
It is more difficult to get to the moon and more difficult to get to the mountains.
It may be that the moon is closer to the Earth at this time of the month, so the lava is more easily visible.
Theories of content are centred on what people find interesting or relevant.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and desires that have been internalised and that they mature into adulthood.
These theories mean that some people will do certain things and others will do other things.
Two theories of famous psychologists, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory, are well known.
There are two ways in which administrators can start to lead their predecessors: either by trying to follow in their footsteps (or even surpass them) or by trying to do something different.
This type of officer has to make unpopular decisions, apply disciplinary measures, carry out assessments, assign responsibility and make others accountable for their actions.
In the case of the latter, the individual is transformed into an individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that he or she has done and become someone else.
The leader is ultimately responsible for the departure and the failure of the mission.
This kind of behaviour often leads to the leaders and the rest of the team being at odds with each other.
Virtuals are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional cars, but with a few small differences.
The members of a virtual group can function as a point of contact for their physical group.
Unlike conventional vehicles, they can be used in different zones at different times, which the local authorities may not be able to understand.
The presence of an "invisible hand" (Larson i LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a component of a virtual equipment.
The 'invisible hand' is the administrator to whom each member must turn.
Why would an organisation want to go through the long process of setting up an organisation to provide training?
Creativity and the use of available resources can be put to good use in the various departments of an organization.
As a result, the joint work of an organization to overcome a particular problem can lead to an innovative process to meet the needs of the client.
For an organization to be innovative, the leader must create a culture of innovation, one that is shared and learned.
Angel (2006) explains the approach as a way of helping organisations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data will provide physical proofs for a theoretical investigation of cognition, and will thus make the area of investigation more exact.
There is a correlation between brain disorders and behaviour.
If you have been involved in a serious accident, trauma, lesion or tumour, you may experience changes in your behaviour and mental functions.
The new technologies make it possible to see and investigate brain structures and processes earlier than ever before.
This provides a wealth of information and material for building models to help us understand processes in our own country.
While the IA has strong connotations of science-fiction, it is a branch of computer science that studies behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation.
The research in AI involves machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
The examples are the control, the planning and the programming, the ability to respond to the diagnosis and the questions of the client, the recognition of the script, the reading and the writing.
These are disciplines that have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The system is used in a number of areas of the economy, medicine, engineering and the military, and has been used in a number of domestic applications and video games.
The excursions are an important part of the curriculum. Teachers often want to take their pupils to places that they have never visited themselves.
Technology offers the solution of virtual visits to museums, to see art works or to contemplate the beauty of art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a good way of reflecting on a trip and sharing experiences with future students.
For example, each year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital, and the website is updated each year, but the old versions are kept online as a record.
The blogs can also help to improve the students' writing skills, as they can start off with a bad grammar and spelling, but then improve as they go along.
As students are often the most critical, the blogger began to try to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
The blogs 'obliguen els estudiants a ser més astuts amb el món que els envolta' (The blogs obligue the students to be more astute and curious (Toto, 2004)).
The blog encourages students to broaden their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The use of blogs by students can help them to be more analytical and critical; they can define their own positions in the context of others and also highlight their own perspectives on specific issues in a concrete way (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual capital of Canada and has a series of art galleries and museums that show the past and present of Canada.
To the south there are the Niagara Falls and to the north the natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
These are all elements, among others, that make Ontario a city that is welcoming to all newcomers.
The population of the large northern extensions is sparse, and some areas are still uninhabited.
For a comparison of populations, there are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are located off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the most different, and a continent in itself, in terms of life.
Most of the smaller islands are either independent nations or associated with France, and are known for their luxury resorts on the beach.
The Arabs also carry Islam to the lands, and they are going to embark on a great journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.

Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling alone should carry a marriage certificate, even if she is not married.
It is also useful to wear a ring (a ring that does not look like a wedding ring).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can cause problems, and they may be subjected to harassment, molestation, etc.
Rebutja els homes amb fermesa, i no tinguis per de defensar la teva posició (amb o sense diferències culturals, no està bé!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the fishermen of the Xth century, the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Berbers, who used it as a strategic port.
The Portuguese will destroy it and then build it again under the name of the White House, only to abandon it again after a thermonuclear attack in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco is going to rebuild the city of Marrakech and call it Daru l-Badya, the name of Casablanca being that of the Spanish merchants who set up trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to visit in Morocco.
The old Medina can be easily found, with shops selling traditional Moroccan products such as tajins, terrissa, objects of pell, narguils, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is not really geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the extreme east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's roads, including the centre.
If you are going to Goma, you should investigate the situation there before you go, because the situation in the province of North Kivu is still very unstable.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the most economical mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to go to Goma. The normal fare (local) is 500 Congolese francs for the journey.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuctu has become a byword for exotic lands.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, but it is a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites at risk because of the threat of the sand dunes.
It is one of the main features of the special "African Wonders" programme by Henry Louis Gates on the PBS.
The city is very different from the rest of the country in that it has a more Arab feel to it than the rest of the country.
The Kruger National Park is situated in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and the border with Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the border with South Africa.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with its own unique flora and fauna.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South Africa's national parks.
In the South African national parks, a daily conservation fee and entry fee must be paid.
You can also buy a Wild Card, which gives you entry to a number of parks in South Africa, including all the national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the centre of the Hong Kong territory and is the place that most tourists consider to be the main centre.
The buildings that make up the urban landscape of Hong Kong have been associated with a graphic of bars that is evident with the presence of the skyscrapers of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the other side of the Kowloon Peninsula.
The major part of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is on land that is not suitable for development.
This is the place where the British colonists will settle, as they did in the past, and it is a good place to start if you want to look for traces of the past colonial period.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, covering 80 km (50 mi) from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The forests are not just a place to hide from the man-eaters, but also include some of the last remaining patches of the most powerful jungles that once covered the planet.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which 1,000 km² is covered by water and mangroves.
The Sundarbans have been declared a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers in the area and 30,000 axis.
The inter-city buses (to the other side of the river) run all day long, most of them to the east and to Jakar/Bumthang, and leave between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m.
As the inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
The majority of the districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
The shared taxis are a quick and convenient way of getting around, to places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a bridge that spans the river at its widest point, linking the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two 3.5-metre-wide lanes.
The space under the bridge is 15 metres high and the final construction is due to be completed in August 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be fully functional by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs officers will be in place.
The indigenous group that was most important was the one that lived in the eastern part of Paraguay, and they were nomadic hunters who also practised subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the home of other indigenous groups, the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
The Paraguay, formerly known as the "Province of the Giants of the Indies," was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish will start the colonisation period that will last for three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for its polo players and equipment.
The most important tournament of the year is the Polo Tournament in Las Cañitas in December.

For information on polo matches or to buy tickets for polo matches, contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Malvinas is the Malvinas pound (FKP), with a value equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
The dinners can be booked in the only restaurant on the islands, which is called Stanley, in front of the FIC West shop.
The British generally accept the pound sterling and the United States dollar as well.
The islands in the periphery probably would not accept credit cards, although they would accept British and American currency; they would have to be checked in advance.
It is impossible to change money into Malvinas currency outside the islands, so you will have to take it with you.
As Montevideo is in the southern hemisphere, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures are over 30 °C.
The winter temperatures are rarely below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particular "wet" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is more or less the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or molested.
According to the authorities, the minimum distance from the fence is 100 yards/metres for bones and 25 yards/metres for other animals.
For all that, bears, wolves, cougars, alligators and so on can attack.
Every year, hundreds of visitors are killed by these animals, which are large, dangerous and potentially lethal.
You should also take into account that the smell of the meat and other animals will be in the air, so you should avoid cooking or eating smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is situated on the island of Upolu and has a population of 40,000.

Reserve a room in advance so that the traveller knows that he or she will have a place to stay when he or she arrives.
The agents of the travel agencies often have agreements with hotels, and you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through them.
The agents of the travel agencies often offer packages that include the breakfast, transport to/from the airport and sometimes even a hotel.
You can also reserve a place if you need to think about the offer or if you need to present other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
Any request or suggestion should be sent to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of the audience decides to camp on site, and the majority of the audience considers this an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to get a good spot to camp out.
Please remember that, even though the main events have finished, there are still sections of the festival that go on until late at night.
Some festivals have special areas for families with small children.

Visibility can also be reduced by the wind, the vehicle's speed or the vehicle's condensation or ice on the windscreen.
The conditions of travel in many countries are normal, with no interruptions and no delays.
The safaris are probably the main attraction for tourists in Africa and are the most relevant for many tourists.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey on foot through the African savannah to see the fantastic wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, are known to take a liking to cars, and the standard equipment will allow you to get a good view.
Animals such as leopards and cheetahs are timid, and that is why they can be seen better with the help of a prism.
A safari is a walk in the countryside, a "rural safari", a "footing" or a "short walk" lasting a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will take place in other sports than athletics.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to host the Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.

You must not allow the luggage to exceed the weight limit (it could damage or even destroy the luggage).
There are different ways of purifying water, and some are more effective against certain dangers.
In some zones there is no water for a minute; in others, you need only wait a few minutes.
The effectiveness of the filter changes from one filter to another, and in the case of any concerns about buying water from a brand you are not familiar with in sealed bottles, you should buy water from a brand you are familiar with.
The animals that they may find in the wild are not familiar to them in their home regions.
The plagues can cause illness, irritation or, in rare cases, allergic reactions, and can spread or transmit infections.
The malalties, or the animals capable of inflicting injuries or killing people, are not normally considered plagues.
The duty-free shops are an opportunity to buy goods tax-free in certain countries.
The tax on alcohol and tobacco products is often very high in certain countries, and the amount of alcohol and tobacco products that can be brought in is often limited.
The tram between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the interstate between Buffalo-Pittsburgh, which passes through wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be warned: there are many bends, steep gradients and narrow roads.
The speed limits are considerably lower than those of the other trams and trains - 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is all the more important.
The mobile phone service is more reliable here than in many other parts of the route, including Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German bakery is good and the Bavarian one is very different, being much more like the Austrian one.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, the food is a generic term for covering a wide range of regional cuisines that can be found throughout the country.
However, if it is not accompanied by other qualifications, the term will mean that the food is from the central and eastern regions of Java.
Today, the cuisine of Java is easy to find in any part of the world and offers a wide variety of dishes, including the well-known cacauets, bitxos, sucre (especially coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The straits are used as a support for the most vulnerable people who want to cross the border.
They are more stable, but they can present problems of security because the genet could get caught in them.
If a horse is a little skittish, it could be spooked by a sudden noise and run off, so it is important to take precautions to minimise the risk of this happening.
