Members of the Welsh Assembly (AMs) are concerned that they will be seen as "puppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from all political spectrums are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Member of the Labour Party Assembly stated that his group was concerned that the "P" would be "Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means idiot and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that his whole group was "disappointed" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was &quot; open &quot; to a name change, but noted that the leap from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed broad support for calling a Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the option MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
It seemed that Members of the Assembly were suggesting alternatives, but the fight for consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, being blocked, as she should send the Bill on the changes through in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members and the design of the committee system.
The Members of the Assembly will have the last word in the question of how they should be called when the legislation is being discussed.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the country &apos; s name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether their country will be renamed "Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, has stated that he will disregard the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin &apos; s bells fall silent as Harlem churches struggle
“Historically, the older people I have spoken to say that there was a pub and a church on every corner,” he comments.
“Today, there is neither one nor the other.”
He noted that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People are socializing differently now,” he says.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighbourhoods that people regularly visit.
With regard to churches, he was concerned that the money raised from the sale of assets would not last as long as church leaders hoped and that "at some point, they will be back to square one."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore they will accelerate the closing of these churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin &apos; s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that was worshipping there acquired the building.
A black congregation took over St. Martin &apos; s, under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were resisting the hiring or promotion of black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while the congregation of Father Johnson made plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, called them "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who had the gavel called it a "cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument."
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first snare drum ever used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who played the Riverside Church drum 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese &apos; s attempt to pass costs on to the parish board, although it had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiger shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for abalone in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the first day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon &apos; s Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about 30 minutes on Saturday morning when he heard the child calling for help, so he swam over with a group to rescue him.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then realized that he was "screaming that he had been bitten."
Hammel noted that the boy &apos; s collarbone was broken when he arrived at the scene.
Hammel said, "I screamed at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark."
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children &apos; s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue swimmer, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area some weeks earlier, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic injuries to the upper chest area.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there were more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury &apos; s plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury &apos; s acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff on the shop floors of their beauty and style stores.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at £2.8 trillion and with growth outstripping that of fashion and homewares, the largest beauty halls in 11 stores across the country will be trialled this year, with a view to rolling out to more stores next year if successful.
Beauty investment comes at the same time as this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use shelf space that used to be devoted to televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury &apos; s stated that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges, with similar areas to other stores, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury &apos; s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second of which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift towards daily small-quantity food shopping in local stores are forcing supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will increasingly resemble shopping centres as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury &apos; s has integrated Argos discount stores into hundreds of outlets and introduced several Habitat stores since acquiring these chains two years ago. It is believed that this has driven food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the chain of supermarkets to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury &apos; s had tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion about how to split the income from the pharmacy sales in its supermarkets.
The new strategy is being pursued following the sale of the 281 Sainsbury &apos; s pharmaceutical outlets to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, commented: 'We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand portfolio is designed to meet all needs, and our attractive environment and convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11m deal
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones was "furious" after Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the fashion and accessory brand Truly.
This business had compared favourably with Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den, by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the girl of gold on television admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for her Truly fashion and accessories brand.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow &apos; s Goop and was shaping up as a favourite to double Willoughby &apos; s fortune, which was estimated at around £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving the business, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented, &quot; Truly, Holly was the main priority for Holly.
It was to be their long-term future, which would keep them going for the next two decades.
Their decision to leave left everyone involved completely stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most successful stars, could cost the company millions of pounds due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and could further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on holiday together and Jones had a 40 per cent share in Baldwin &apos; s television production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV &apos; s I &apos; m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said that last night "we did not talk about business."
A difficult conversation &quot; and then we fell in love &quot;
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some might consider "not presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented in his mocking voice of a "news presenter."
“I have not given up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting him again after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea &apos; s chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world &apos; s leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country has not seen an &quot; appropriate &quot; response from the United States to North Korea &apos; s first steps towards denuclearization.
The United States, on the other hand, continued to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump &apos; s speech was much more optimistic than the one he gave during his rally.
“We get along great with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
We now have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers to their families.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach in speaking about relations with Kim.
It is very easy to be presidential, but then instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we would have 200 people right here, he said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for international aid to be mobilized.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a little,” she explains.
While Save the Children was preparing a team to go to Palu, it was still unclear whether foreign staff could work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations would be allowed to provide assistance.
Given that Indonesia is a country where the land is constantly moving, it is incredible how little the country is prepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, including if there had been a prior warning, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, travelling from one island in Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the new disaster enclave.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia &apos; s dilapidated infrastructure the central theme of his election campaign, and has allocated a fair amount of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is facing re-election next year.
It must also deal with the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equalizes for Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea &apos; s goal, when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot and kicked it with his right foot before it went over the crossbar.
The action sent him over the area and towards the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
“I was trying to get myself into that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I gave him a little nudge. I didn &apos; t think too much about it, I just let it go.”
Chelsea were winning 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues &apos; half-way line pass to Mateo Kovacic was a step-over before he turned and dribbled into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle of the field.
He then made a lovely pass into space that led to Hazard in the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished with a left-footed shot that Liverpool &apos; s Alisson Becker could not stop.
On Wednesday, 15:00, Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage. The match will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Meanwhile, Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the Indonesian emergency agency at the beginning of Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday, which triggered waves of up to six metres, according to the agency &apos; s spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press briefing.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect in murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at Grayson Mews, John Street, at 0755 hours, leading to the arrest of a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, Birkenhead, and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
In addition, he would recommend that anyone who may have seen something on dashcam contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A Police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
Some people who claimed to know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that nobody can enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to discover what had happened.
Residents are now being told that they will be allowed back in within the next few hours.
Someone heard an agent telling a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He keeps repeating "it is terrible."
At 1400 hours, two police vans were inside the cordon and one outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon, controlling the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, registration number 247, on 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament Square becomes the last commemorative success in “rewriting history”
Its banning would be a poetic act of justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by its puritanical fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick &apos; s suggestions as "madness" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, commented: &quot; In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed on the altar of the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, a century earlier.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft Cromwell is a testimony to the opinion of the nineteenth century and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Many people see Cromwell, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, clearly, the monarchy.
If it is a completely accurate description, then it is a matter for the historical debate to continue.
What is true is that the mid-seventeenth-century conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a livestock farmer at a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery severed and covered in blood near a pigsty at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pen in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It appears that he travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The following morning, his uncle found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that there was a big pig with blood on its mouth in the sty.
The post-mortem examination confirmed that the pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin &apos; s legs were bloodied and mangled,” he said, using his family name, Wu, to The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was penned to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It appears that the family of Yuan and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, this is not the first time that a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it off.
After pigs ate a rancher in Oregon in 2012, a rancher in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious, and their intention is not to hurt.
What was needed was the appropriate respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rainfall in the south-east United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters off the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa produced gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, from Sunday morning (5 a.m. Eastern Standard Time) to Monday morning (5 a.m. Eastern Standard Time), and was located about 620 km south-southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressure systems are beginning to develop in the Pacific, moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rains northward, towards the southwest United States.
Rosa is expected to leave more than 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical rain meets the low pressure system that is approaching, widespread heavy rainfall is expected in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible desert slip.
Heavy tropical rains will cause rainfall rates of almost 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 inches of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the nature of tropical rainfall, flash floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions may occur.
The threat of tropical torrential rains is not recommended at all for desert walking.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms could cause localized winds and dust clouds.
The approaching low pressure systems will bring heavy rains to specific parts of the southern California coast.
Heavy rains may leave up to two inches of water, which could cause small debris flows and make roads slippery.
This would be the first heavy rains of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before becoming widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and all day Wednesday.
Intense temperature changes in the United States can be expected in October as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
This may involve drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences will be seen across the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the long-lasting heat of the summer will attempt to recover and spread again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start is expected in October, with widespread temperatures in the mid-20s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could see temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term outlook indicates high probabilities of above-normal temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony
More than 20 million people watched the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the policy remained stalled and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest developments from Friday: a deal crafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake to have the FBI conduct an investigation for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while she was drunk and that he tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his impassioned testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely certain that that had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who watched Nielsen on Friday may have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that carried the speech, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some difficulty in calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a hearing similar to that of a football playoff or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have strongly supported Kavanaugh &apos; s nomination, led the pack, with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers for a full day &apos; s worth of testimony, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 billion, NBC had $2.94 billion, MSNBC had $2.89 billion and CNN had $2.52 billion, Nielsen commented.
There was a great deal of interest after the appearance.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing.
As he was being berated, live on CNN, he looked dejected.
Looking me in the face, one woman said, &quot; I am a victim of rape.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
And she continued: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Mr. Flake said that his office had issued a press release and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say in his appearance before the Committee.
Cable and broadcast television networks aired it all live hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to nominate Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the following week, which some Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake &apos; s decision was critical, as it became clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to pass Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of "playing politics"
Prime Minister Theresa May accused her critics of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, will address the Conservative Party Conference to be held in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside hers on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to share customs duties was "completely absurd".
Wayde murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player &apos; s death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, 20, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder by the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The glasses were recovered at the crime scene and tested by the police, who found Simpson &apos; s DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say that he admitted shooting Wayde.
A bail bond of USD 350,000 has been set, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head that had entered the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police crime laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU &apos; s director of athletics, thanked the local police force for its "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one game of the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "in shock" over the death of Wayde Sims.
These are the things that people always worry about, he said.
Volcano spews ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed signs of activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo," has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between anti-riot police and pro-independence demonstrators as thousands of people took part in counter-demonstrations on the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists who had been blocked by the riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in the late evening and the police used batons to quell the fighting.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans such as "Neither forgiveness nor forgetting," clashed with unionist demonstrators, shouting "Long live Spain."
Four people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrated.
The voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, as those who were against secession boycotted the referendum in large numbers.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent voting at polling stations throughout the region, where there were violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a show of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” she said.
Despite a narrow victory in the December regional elections, the pro-Catalan parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
“It is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday at approximately 1930 hours on Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that the access and the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, the car may have been shot at with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga &apos; s first goal for Livingston ensured victory
A Livingston-promoted Rangers impressed the Ibrox club by securing Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager.
Dolly Menga &apos; s strike made the difference. Gary Holt &apos; s goal took Hibs up to second place.
This season, Gerrard's team have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table by eight points.
Before that, Rapid Vienna will be visiting Rangers on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their winning run in the division to six games, with manager Kenny Miller still to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against a powerful visitor
Holt &apos; s team should have been a step ahead much earlier, causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence but failed to score from the penalty spot. Then Alan Lithgow saw a shot deflected off Alan Gow to score a header from Craig Halkett &apos; s cross.
The home team &apos; s team consisted of letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-control play.
Thus the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers gave them a free-kick and Livingston tried to find an opening, with a combined play from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that point Rangers were in control of the ball but were unable to break down the home defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was relatively untroubled.
That continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor saved Scott Pittman &apos; s shot with a kick and Livingston were denied a second goal by a long wayward shot from Lithgow.
There were long passes into Livingston constantly, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one after Halkett &apos; s shot on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a hand.
“Fenomenal” Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous view is that they played a great game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and their roster have hardly changed since their promotion, but that is largely due to Holt, who has strengthened the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was immense and marshalled a superbly organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some very good moments with Gerrard, they came up short.
They failed to execute their plays, as they only managed to penetrate the opposition's half once, which is a warning to Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, there were smiles and a blue sky at the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also spoke out against both his policies and the German government &apos; s decision to welcome him to the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at about 1015 hours.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by the paramedics, but he died there and then.
The accident occurred after another cyclist was killed after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of Saturday &apos; s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been blocked and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the Director of the prison.
The disturbances started at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 9.30 on Sunday and are still continuing.
A team of elite specialists (known as &quot; Tornado &quot;) is in charge of controlling the disturbances, involving eight inmates and affecting one pavilion.
The officers received minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service comments: &quot; Specialist prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in jail.”
Long Lartin prison holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital care after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, prison officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which prison officers were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen early next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep across the Southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern Nevada and eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix commented in a tweet that &quot; only 10 hurricanes have maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 km of the Arizona border.”
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of torrential rainfall, which can reach 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Escarpment in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 cm, with the possibility of up to 10 cm in isolated areas, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Rift Valley.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rains are considered a blessing, as the region is suffering from drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, part of these torrential rains may be beneficial because of the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which is expected to be a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 kilometres per hour as of Sunday morning, is located 619 kilometres south-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving northward at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is running into cooler waters in the Pacific, and is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to intensify into a tropical storm by late Monday afternoon over Mexico.
Heavy rainfall is expected in some parts of Mexico, where there is a significant risk of flooding.
“Heavy rains of 7 to 15 inches are expected from Baja California to Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 inches,” as reported by weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then move across Arizona into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main danger of Rosa or its remains is the torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and southwest USA.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he is &quot; stable &quot;.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to the Avon and Somerset Constabulary.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh &quot; suffered the meanness and anger &quot; of the Democratic Party
Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the despicable and disgusting tactics of the Democrat Party, Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had been "suffering the meanness and the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers with great emotion and force.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the President said that, on that day, "Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our day, a jurist with an admirable record of public service.
The President made indirect references to Judge Kavanaugh &apos; s nomination when speaking about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not running, but I am a candidate,” he said.
That is why I go from one place to another, fighting to get great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
A senior Republican official told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh &apos; s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the toll is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in Palu city to celebrate a festival on Friday night when waves as high as six metres hit the coast in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When yesterday it was announced that a tsunami might occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), at a press briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, and everything on land, said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved at 800 km/h in the open sea before hitting the coast.
He added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 evacuation centres in Palu.
The photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Shelling continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT, by its Indonesian acronym) reported in a press release that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
He added that the geography of the city, which is built on the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the destroyed buildings, and 540 persons were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300-kilometre stretch of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
The communications &quot; were completely paralyzed and there was no information &quot; from Donggala, he commented.
More than 300,000 people were living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This was a tragedy in itself, but could be much worse, he said.
On Saturday, the agency came under fire for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities say that the waves had already reached the coast by the time the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man can be heard warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in the surrounding area of Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city &apos; s airport had reopened for relief work only and would remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centres in Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
That is very bad.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala had arrived safely in Palu, where staff were sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they had seen a devastating scene on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
He said that he had been told that many houses had been destroyed.
That is very bad.
Even as the aid groups were putting the wheels of assistance in motion, some people were complaining that the movement of experienced aid workers to Palu was being blocked.
Under Indonesian regulations, only foreign funding, supplies and deployment of personnel can be sought if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And that has not yet happened.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government says it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but it has not happened yet.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolate stories that natural disasters write.
A small child was rescued from a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other students of his who were trapped in the Hotel Roa-Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were among those caught.
“As someone who has worked in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional baggage,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a grey check mark, not two blue check marks.
He said that he believed that meant that the messages had not been delivered.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a cash reload at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, two robbers accosted a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM machine located in the entertainment centre and was preparing to reload it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money intended for reloading."
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person with information on the identities of these individuals should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will now be known as Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time now, and he used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
It replaced Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously stated that the word had religious significance for him.
“I think it is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West said early this year while talking about the album title with radio host Big Boy.
"I am you, you are me, means we.
He went from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, all of it.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected Mexican President, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Square that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly stipends to those who study and by opening more public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in AI, the United States should double its investment in research in this field, argues Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after announcements by various parts of the US Government, including when, in general, the United States lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China has presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number one in innovation in IA by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging far behind the United States. We are looking forward to the next step in the field of I.A.”, Lee comments.
Double the funding means double the chances that the next great achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the United States, as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book &quot; AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order &quot; was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China &apos; s most important I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system that defeated the best American player of Othello. Subsequently, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
He commended previous technological competitions run by the United States Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often had to work hard to obtain government grants, Lee commented.
“It is not China that is taking the academic leaders; it is the corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent academics to work on I. A.
Lee commented that changes in U.S. immigration policy could also help intensify U.S. efforts in I.A.
I think that doctors in I.A. should be given permanent residence cards automatically, he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals from academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee commented.
In early 2001, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from industry and academia. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research on I.A.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether they are going to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name will change to "Republic of Macedonia North", a gesture that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which had blocked its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Slav population, the majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the turnout will reach the minimum 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum ballot paper asked: "Do you support accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Those in favour of changing the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, a number of Members have said that they will respect the result of the vote so that it will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, from Skopie, said: 'I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe.'
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on changing the name of the country, which would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents of those who were boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our heads held high, not through the back door,” he said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that joining NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, whose unemployment rate is over 20 per cent.
I believe that the great majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Mr Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future."
A survey published on Monday by the Institute for Public Policy Research claimed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum, which would be lower than the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, Macedonia, revealed that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
Should it fail, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, evades the whole Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart the Brighton defence in Manchester City &apos; s 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian winger received a yellow card in the early stages of the game.
It ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking into open space.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded one defender before beating several more on the Brighton touchline.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who struck it with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that hit the right post.
Pep Guardiola, the City manager, said Aguero had some problems with his foot.
We said that it would play for 55 to 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.”
However, it was Sterling who gave City the initial advantage in the Premier League title race.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton goal.
He made a lovely ball to the left-hand side for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before sending him to the second post.
The Sky Blues forward launched the ball into the net just before leaving the field.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match on Tuesday, 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies &apos; party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies at least secured one wildcard spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still chasing their first division title.
Even though we are not playing for anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be loud and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I have faced this year.
Why would they not want to participate?
Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but it looks like they are leaning towards going with Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who will make his opening statement at number 34, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The record of the Washington pitcher is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation, his nomination to the Supreme Court, when speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
In November, everything we have done is at stake.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is one of the most important. I am not running, but I am fighting for great candidates, so I go from one place to another,” he said.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, they are now in power."
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, and we see the meanness, the evil.
They do not care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control. And we are not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, were embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
“We have seen it these last four days,” he said, saying that Democrats were “angry, bad, horrible and fake.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, nominating Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, &quot; What?
No, no, I hope for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.”
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a long line of Labour Members of Parliament who are told that we are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in the House of Commons, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, for Europe. It was ironic that it was issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, "we want inclusive and productive meetings."
For the greater part of the eight years that I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more compassionate and merciful" policy has long since been forgotten, if it was ever implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged in terms of whether or not party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to change his mind radically and take positions with which he had never been comfortable, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of abuse on social media calling for my resignation, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one to have experienced this.
I am aware that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist abuse, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that broad range of views, and with every "no-confidence" motion or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice to keep my head down and not make too much noise and then I would be "all right".
But I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher Government which left my comprehensive school building literally in ruins, I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a Minister in the Government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, and I have not done so in the last elections.
It is impossible that anyone in Nottingham East would not know my political positions and areas where I disagreed with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday is that I do not understand this desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Notts Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are Labour voters or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any political opportunism will stop me from acting in the way I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an unbeaten Ayr rise to the top
Two late tries may have decided the final outcome, but Ayr certainly deserved the victory in this entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now the top team in the table and the only undefeated team of the ten participating teams.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make the most of opportunities, that gave the local team the victory, and so Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased with his team.
“We have been tested in all the parties and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy about that,” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: "Ayr deserves the recognition, they took their opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's try at 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, on loan from the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage and Jason Baggott scored an unconverted try.
Climax extended Ayr &apos; s lead with a penalty. Just before the interval, he scored and converted a solo try, leaving the score at 17-5 in Ayr &apos; s favour at the break.
However, Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson &apos; s try, converted by Baggott, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long delay after Ruaridh Knott sustained a serious injury and had to be stretchered off, and Ayr went on to lead by a Climo penalty.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having one more man with a non-conversion by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the premises were recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for pleasing Climo without the ball from a penalty line-out, MacPherson made a try from the back of the maul as it was advancing.
The weather converted him, as it had done almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry to the ground with a kick and took the fifth shot at the locals &apos; goal.
Still Game star wants to steer his career towards the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems determined to move into the restaurant business after it was revealed that he had been appointed manager of a chain of restaurants.
The actor, 56, is Jack Jarvis, who is the star of the famous BBC programme, writes and co-produces it with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the ninth series will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming Glasgow restaurant trade."
“The sea is ours”: a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Navy personnel are stationed at a naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
It is a duty to recover it.
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, the lost coast, which was the scene of a bloody conflict over resources in the nineteenth century, is still vividly remembered, as is the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is expecting a resolution from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and calm, and is waiting for the result with a positive outlook, commented Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia &apos; s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is locked in a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution adopted on Monday.
He promised in late August that we are "very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia &apos; s favour and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice &apos; s resolution came only six months after the final submissions indicated that the case was &quot; not complicated &quot;, said Chilean expert Paz Zárate.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have hampered it.
The problem of access to the sea had been seized by the current Bolivian administration, he said.
In addition, he suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales had undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia &apos; s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court &apos; s decision-making was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia would be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and to put an end to 139 years of mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The resolution is an opportunity to see what we need to leave behind.
North Korea says that there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said that his nation would never be the first to give up nuclear disarmament if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
It urged the United States to honour the pledges made at a summit meeting in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when Mike Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, appears to be on the verge of restarting diplomatic nuclear talks that have been stalled for more than three months since this summit with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.
He said that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the United States &apos; opposition to a declaration that would end the Korean War and bring North Korea to its knees was a "pipe dream."
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without some meaningful disarmament movement by Pyongyang.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang &apos; s commitment to give up a weapon system that the country probably regards as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is expected to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The Paris fashion parades reveal the latest line of huge hats about to land on a street of shops near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a collection of eccentric large-size hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the runway.
Valentino &apos; s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that enveloped the heads of the models.
Other large-scale additions included pineapples with jewels, a wizard &apos; s hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of eccentric masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-up lips and bore a more Hannibal Lecter than haute couture resemblance.
One creation recalled a full scuba diving team, including snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're in luck.
The haters of style predict that the huge hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
The big hats are coming in strong with “La Bomba”, with a straw hat with a 60-centimetre brim worn by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The hat &apos; s cult following, which flooded social media, presented another great creation on the runway: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini.
The Jacquemus La Riviera collection for spring/summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week featured the orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle.
As FEMAIL reported, stylist Luke Armitage said: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories."
John Edward: linguistic skills are vital for citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the examinations, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in the areas of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils in every corner of Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they will occupy as citizens of the world.
As a sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, modern languages are still popular and in demand in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, &quot; If you talk to a man in a language he understands, then he will listen to you.
If you talk to them in their language, you reach their hearts.
This is a powerful reminder that, if one wants to establish relations and build trust with people from other countries, one cannot rely solely on English.
If we look at the recent results of this year &apos; s examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables, with the pass rates highest in independent schools.
Overall, 68 per cent of pupils studying foreign languages achieved an A, the highest grade.
Data from the 74 centres in the SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A in Chinese, 72 per cent of students achieved an A in German, 69 per cent of students achieved an A in French and 63 per cent of students achieved an A in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental competence that both children and young people will need in the future without a doubt.
Currently, languages are considered to be on the same level as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, of the reasons given by employers for difficulties in filling jobs, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential for employment requiring language skills is increasing, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career path someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to this kind of skill, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with persons from foreign countries will automatically give that person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. It was also established that the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, 15%, was French.
That is why investing in language education is important for today &apos; s children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities of finding a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more traditional modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, independent schools always offer a choice of languages taught by specialist staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing an environment of learning that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital role to play in the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered &quot; languages for international communication &quot;.
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Well, we have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans who are waiting to see LeBron James make his debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Luke Walton, head coach of the Lakers, announced that James will play in the season opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is still not clear how many minutes will be played.
Walton commented on the Lakers &apos; official website, &quot; It will be more than one and less than 48 &quot;.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that it was likely that James would play for a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers &apos; six-game preseason schedule.
At this stage of his career, he said, he did not need pre-season parties to prepare.
Time of Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump &apos; s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be viewed online?
Trump &apos; s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. this evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
It can be viewed online through a live YouTube broadcast.
It is likely that Trump will comment on this week &apos; s testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which was overshadowed by allegations of sexual misconduct and has left the Senate waiting for an early vote on confirmation for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, the President &apos; s campaign noted that the five rallies next week are intended to &quot; rally volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, &quot; according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the campaign, said a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named.
The rally tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage from Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is falling behind in the polls.
For Morrisey, it was not a good sign that the president had to come to his rescue in the polls, Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows that it is willing to fight to keep the hope alive for the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept, but the players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
So where do you think the impetus is now?
“We were six points down and now we are four points down, so I guess that is a little bit of a boost,” Jordan Spieth said after the round.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel they have a bit of wind behind them and plenty of reasons to be cheerful, not least the partnership of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and picked up four points each.
Spieth has been deadly off the tee and preaches by example.
The guttural roars of celebration grew louder as the pair's round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth round when they and Thomas were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the match on the 15th was greeted with a similar roar, one that conveyed the belief that the US team was not yet out of it.
“What is needed is redoubling of efforts and concentration on the game,” said Spieth.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable couple of Europe are four from four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only pair to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That run and the way it is flowing with the noisy crowd on Sunday makes it clear that these are the players to beat, and there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning, after teaming with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help on Sunday to get out of the holes.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch up close because you see the interaction between the couples, the advice that is given and the advice that is not given, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team is willing to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after the fourballs and foursomes were completed with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The two-man team of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two wins over a Tiger Woods who was struggling, moving four points clear in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a US team that made many errors during the foursomes in the morning, which ended 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs to pick up eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership served to beat a dejected Woods and a rookie American Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who had not really shone in the two matches on Saturday, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the afternoon fourballs, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world #1 and #3 players respectively, 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the south-west of Paris, Europe was not having all its cake and eating it.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas served as the standard for the Americans, who earned two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2&amp;1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish player Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&amp;3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has recovered from a four-point deficit in the singles only twice, but Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a tie to retain it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that "there is no possibility" of unilateral disarmament if it does not have confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his country &apos; s distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the international agency that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing itself to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we have not received any similar response from the United States,” he said.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of our unilateral disarmament.
While Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington &apos; s resistance to a "phased" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an American president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un committed to working towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official goal of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can give up its arms.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a declaration of the end of war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us kneel is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention any plans for a second Trump-Kim summit, announced with great fanfare by the US President at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea, in the past five months, and added: "If South Korea had been the party to denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri &apos; s tone was radically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that missiles from North Korea would be directed towards US soil after &quot; malignant &quot; President Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim &quot; rocket man &quot;.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and that sanctions should continue to be applied until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, “The imposition of the Security Council sanctions must continue strongly and without fail until we realize a fully verified and complete denuclearization.”
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours, North Korea had denounced its "demands as those of a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to sleep enough
Thanks to a new course being offered this year at Harvard University, all university students are now trying to sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of all-night studying fuelled by caffeine.
A professor discovered that students at the world &apos; s number one university had little idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
Her motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was just hearing about this now, in her final year.
He said that nobody had ever told him the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos; s health services, noted that the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a routine for going to bed.
In another section, participants are informed that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students overnight.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He stated that the culture of "pulling all-nighters" still exists and added that modern technology and increased pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good night &apos; s sleep should be the &quot; secret weapon &quot; of students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so they are always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
It hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar programme of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler &apos; s recommendation is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of &quot; blue light &quot; emitted by screens and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, and thus have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga goal sinks Gerrard men
Rangers suffered another away-day depression when the Dolly Menga attack saw the disjointed Steven Gerrard team go down 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox wanted their first away win since February 4's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, who lead the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga &apos; s attack came just minutes before half-time and Rangers &apos; lacklustre line-up was never in the game.
Now Rangers drop to sixth, Livingston move up to third, behind Hibs by goal difference.
The Rangers may have more problems, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after allegedly being hit by an object from the visiting team bench.
Gerrard changed eight of the starters from the team that won the game against Ayr, reaching the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, will have been pleased with the way his well-drilled Livingston side suffocated Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his well-drilled team suffocated their opponents throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have been awarded at the two-minute mark, when Menga made a pass into space for Scott Pittman, who passed through the defence, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent it out.
Keaghan Jacobs was penalised for a high tackle on captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only send it out over the touchline.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction in their play in the third period.
Alfredo Morelos was certainly aggrieved when he felt he was penalised in the 15th minute of the game when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
Rangers had two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly was hardly troubled by Lassana Coulibaly &apos; s header and Ovie Ejaria &apos; s tame effort.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute came against the run of play, nobody can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, the Rangers could not cope with a deep pass from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to score.
In stoppage time, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the winger played a ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly stepped out of his line to block it.
Still, Livingston continued to feed the visitors exactly the sort of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing a path with one long ball after another.
Holt could have taken more advantage of the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow finished off a header that went over the bar.
The Rangers substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty in the dying seconds after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson once again looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the “Sunday Morning” newspaper, 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and counting... born in Germany was the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado," with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium."
When you put on the earphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to reach the age of 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a common protein in many cancers and reflect it back.
A vaccine trial is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein called HER2 in many cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “promotes growth of different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancerous cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West went on a rant in support of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It did not work out.
Kanye West was booed off the Saturday Night Live studio after a performance that was erratic, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I talk to white people all the time and they ask me how I can like Trump when he is racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL opened the show with a sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted the audio of West &apos; s rant on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the audience that he had been unhappy backstage because he was wearing the hat.
They messed with me.
I was told not to wear my hat.
They messed with me!
And then they say I am asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: &quot; Do you want to see me asleep? &quot; and added that he was &quot; going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant that nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward? &quot;
Try with love.”
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and Variety reported that SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to one person who spoke to the magazine.
West had been invited to replace Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died recently.
West shocked many when he came on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier singing I Love it.
West received the support of the leader of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE CROWD."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
But I decide not to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I think is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We also”, he added.
Before the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
It is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as P Diddy, Puffy and Puff Daddy.
Your colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates &apos; Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such roles on screen often told young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that "something went wrong" and questioned how to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, also admitted that he thought it &quot; quite important &quot; to address the issue.
“Personally, I think it is quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?”, he commented.
What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems we see now?
Kit believes that television can have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on television and in the street that makes young people feel that they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends this summer, saying that he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
In November, Kit will star in True West, the Sam Shepard play about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
He recently revealed that he believes knowing his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, I have given my future family and life from now on,” he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit Harington &apos; s character Jon Snow in the fantasy series that won Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm in the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40 000 new cases were reported.
The majority of these cases were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been reduced to a very small extent, Chinese health authorities said at a congress in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community faced much discrimination.
Because of the country &apos; s conservative values, studies have calculated that between 70 and 90 per cent of men who have sex with men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the failure to use proper protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data on Republican senators and says it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican United States Senators on Wikipedia pages about legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were being pushed by right-wing commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more lies,” she commented on Twitter.
The information allegedly published included the addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted the information on the Internet during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with Waters &apos; office and released the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and a total lie,” she continued.
The staff member whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a total lie.”
Waters &apos; statement was immediately criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote, "Denies this information with anger."
This suggests that the necessary self-restraint to be a Member of Congress is lacking.
When someone is accused of something that he did not do, he should not get angry.
It should not rebel.
It should not question the motives of the accuser.
It must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during his testimony on Thursday.
Republican Omar Navarro, who is challenging Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If that is true, it is very serious,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Ms. Waters said that her office had alerted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations."
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally accountable for all these destructive and dangerous acts against all my staff members,” he said.
Johnny English: Back in Action. Rowan Atkinson &apos; s spoof spy is a letdown
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new British-themed film, and it seems to be what is expected of this new Johnny English parody action and comedy franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this ironic self-deprecation about how clearly ridiculous we are be the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his licence to make a fool of himself for the second time. His name alone gives clues that he is a creation designed for territories with a non-English-speaking cinema audience.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent, despite its strange claims to glamour, who has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a dash of that type who only played one note at the Carros de fuego ceremony at the opening of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious man traveller and international figure that Atkinson had represented years ago in the Barclaycard television adverts, sowing chaos in his wake.
There are one or two good moments in this last instalment.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter in full medieval armour while the rotors hit the hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humour is disappointingly thin and seems oddly superfluous, especially now that franchises of'serious' films such as James Bond and Mission: Impossible are adding comic ingredients without a hitch.
The humour seems to be aimed more at children than adults, and for me the absurd mishaps of Johnny English are not as clever and well-judged as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in deep trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent in the field, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the final straw for the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered figure who is watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this role, which is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to recruit one who is retired.
That is the bumbling Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh school, although he gives unofficial lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy school like the one in Rock School.
Whitehall is moved to an urgent meeting and meets his old pal Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man with a submariner captain, a role that Vicki Pepperdine does not exploit enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of Her Majesty return to action, with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic multi-millionaire from the world of technology who claims to be able to solve Britain &apos; s IT problems: sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta &apos; s house.
The last sequence was definitely exploited to the full, but, however much it may be funny and noisy, the whole thing still has a rather childish feel to it.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I could not help but wonder whether the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan to make Britons work four days a week and be paid for five.
The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan whereby Britons would work four days a week, but would be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the owners of enterprises to allocate the savings from the AI revolution to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same salary.
Sources indicate that the idea &quot; fits &quot; into the party &apos; s economic plans and agenda, and would tilt the country towards the workers.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way of workers making the most of the changing economy.
As one senior Labour Party figure commented to The Sunday Times: we are expecting a revision of the directive before the end of the year.
The four-day working week is not going to be achieved overnight, but the party is definitely committed to it and expects to incorporate it into its overall strategy for re-balancing the economy in favour of the worker.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at present not all of the Labour Party is in favour of this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day week is not party policy and is not going to be discussed at this time."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to restore powers of "anonymous directors" and "well-paid" directors of public utilities companies.
One of the shadow Minister's plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders in the water companies will not get back all their shares, as a Labour government could apply deductions to reflect the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10 per cent of shares in private sector companies would be allocated to employees, with annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has at least delayed by a week the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court judge, and raises the question of whether the results could influence any Republican Senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could produce information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
Of course, Kennedy said.
I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was "firm, resolute, decisive".
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would just ignore the accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it flatly," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the persons she names has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive roster of stars for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park &apos; s Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be reminded of the real purpose of the event: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they could afford a VIP ticket), concert attendees had to complete a series of tasks or &quot; actions &quot;, such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, making a phone call or any other activity that would help raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
What has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of its existence?
The idea of a free concert as a genuine way of persuading people to take action or not is just another form of 'clicktivism', which is the name given to the position we adopt when we believe we are doing something really useful by signing an online petition or sending a tweet.
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favour of a wide range of different goals.
Through these actions, they claim to have secured commitments and policies worth over $37 billion from global leaders that will impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people in 2030.
By early 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition," a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom, united in the common commitment to "help children grow and reach their full potential." To that end, $35 million has been proposed to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and Global Citizens partners like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of “The Power of Nutrition,” to the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claimed that, after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we think can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and hard road, and we will stumble and fall many times along the way.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already shown, we will succeed in achieving our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we have lined up for this year &apos; s New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its Navy to carry out the energy export embargo on Russia - Secretariat of the Interior
In "necessary" circumstances, Washington could call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up markets, including the Middle East, according to US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the Russian alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is merely a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the most southerly supplier of Europe," he said.
Moreover, according to official information, there are ways and means of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as "the voice of energy consumers in the United States."
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is, essentially, to exploit and replace fuels, he warned, adding that Russia can only do one thing, and that is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made at a time when the Trump administration has been trying to push liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to displace Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted throughout that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends the fact that Washington &apos; s fierce opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic considerations and is yet another example of unfair competition.
I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot become a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow last September.
The United States position, however, has met with a rejection from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It was a major problem when a third state interfered with our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a visit to the Holyoke City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women in leadership, she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a speech at City Hall and said that "he was taking the country down the wrong path."
She said she was "really concerned about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy."
Warren spoke candidly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
A poll was released on Thursday, however, which showed that a majority of Warren &apos; s own voters do not believe she should run for President in 2020.
A 58 per cent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said that Senator Kerry should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
A 32 per cent of those polled did, however, support his candidacy.
The survey showed a greater level of support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy in 2020 of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin &apos; s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
The situation my son is going through, everything that has happened since he came back, you know it very well, the other families that suffer the effects of TBI and other wounds that our soldiers come back with, you know it very well, you know it very well.
Palin referred to this arrest as the "big taboo nobody wants to talk about," and commented on her son and other veterans of war that "they come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there is really that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on a domestic violence charge that interfered with a domestic violence complaint and a weapons charge under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new United States policy that denies asylum to domestic violence or gang victims.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a "friendly letter" on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum-seeker who is currently facing the current directive, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" filed by the ACLU in August 2004 against the federal policy had not been revealed.
She said that her partner and his children, who were members of a violent gang, had abused her, but the US officials denied her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
Counsel representing these States, who defended Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum in this country.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, made statements on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum applications must be decided on the facts and circumstances of the individual application and not on a general principle, whereas this exception violates that principle, the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also wrote that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is harmful to the US economy, claiming that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and that they are a "necessary workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to domestic violence and gang violence victims.
Asylum can be sought by individuals who leave their countries of origin because of persecution or threats on account of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said when he announced this directive on 11 June.
Asylum was never created as a measure to address all problems, let alone all serious problems, that people face daily around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us that the situation was very tense as she tried to comfort her feverish baby at a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search through the few belongings that remain, in an effort to salvage what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building because of the continuing aftershocks, which were also very strong.
I could not help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We did not have time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the rubble, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I do not know what has happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper by a Chinese government newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the United States Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday last week, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely read newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the United States elections on 6 November, something that China denies.
Trump &apos; s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the US elections marked a new phase in a growing US campaign to pressure China, according to US officials cited by Reuters.
While it is common for foreign Governments to issue advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led to both sides increasing tariff levels on imports from each other.
China &apos; s countervailing duties, which were in place at the start of the trade war, were designed to fall on exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Donald Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the United States Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is intensifying this pressure with advertisements in our free press."
To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and press to try to place an advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
In contrast, in the newsstand where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that the economy of their country is taking, as the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China had declined to publish" his article, but did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts note that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are now rallying behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially among women, could occur in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense, and many Republicans have expressed their desire to proceed with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday that "this is not a situation where you can back down."
Reeher said he doubted that the latest attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself in favour of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters who were upset about this issue.
Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered outside the Senate were chanting "November is coming!" (November will be here soon!) as the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the Kavanaugh nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by The Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is way beyond any prediction, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, to the news site.
People say that the impact is already very significant, and that is indeed the case.
But it could be even greater, especially among indecisive women from the outskirts of the cities and among younger voters, aged 18-29, who do not usually vote, even if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford &apos; s public testimony in which she detailed her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts indicated that a backslide could occur if Republicans pressed ahead with the confirmation.
This has become a big mess for the Republican Party, said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as early as last week, according to NBC News.
It is not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or even whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench; it is also about how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know whom to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are siding with Kavanaugh.
In a new YouGov poll, 41 per cent of respondents say they believe Ford &apos; s testimony definitively or probably, while 35 per cent say they believe Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh lied under oath, while 30 per cent said the same of Ford.
Following Flake &apos; s push, the FBI is now investigating Ford &apos; s statements, as well as at least those of another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at age 17.
Ramirez, for his part, claimed that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project from the technology legend. A company that is based on the open source code platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world."
It must be now, he said about the startup.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create their own "personal data locker" or POD.
It can contain lists, lists of tasks pending, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique to online personal data storage is that the user is the one who decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal data training."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company &apos; s chief executive officer, John Bruce, is to integrate the resources, processes and skills needed for Solid to reach everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers on the payroll who were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce or not a radical change where all their business models are completely changed overnight.
We are not going to ask for permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on network neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant was honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, her two grandchildren found a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the decoration.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire."
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage," advanced the line before reaching a single-barrel gun and knocking out three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather &apos; s actions were "so great that I will never reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is made clear when he is shown such a large support."
MMA fans stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig
Imagine that he stays up all night to watch Bellator 206 so that he can finally see the main event, only to be told that he cannot.
The San José poster featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was to be broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the United Kingdom were left stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
One Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a big joke."
There is government regulation of what is broadcast after 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change the programming to children, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of marketing and communications at Bellator.
"Peppa the pig", yes.
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said that they would be changing the programme to include British viewers in the next editions.
When I think of the option of retransmission, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it is at 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming changed, there were a great many messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because we thought it was a technical problem at first.
But it was not so, it was a government problem.
I can promise that it will not happen again.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is the usual number, in order to offer more than usual to the fans and we went over.
It is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but that was what drove him to become a success.
At 24, she told us that she did not realize until she went to secondary school that "not everyone was like me."
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that her intention in talking about gay rights was to "transmit hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to take less importance in winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this legendary programme, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first Daley programme, Daley, who had presented himself as a marginal figure, commented that he had felt "inferior" to the rest of the children during his childhood because "society did not accept that you liked boys and girls."
She said: "Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to show that he was "something," he said, so he did not disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent face of the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games this year held in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he told his story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to share that "hope" with others.
The three-time world champion declared that it was a surprise for her too to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar-winning winner of his affection, who is 20 years his junior, although he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
When you &apos; ve lived so much from such a young age (she was 14 when she first went to the Olympics and her father died of cancer three years later), it &apos; s hard to find someone your own age who has been through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "overall perspective" had changed.
If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have been about 'I have to win a gold medal,' " she said.
But you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without doubt, Robbie."
His son is named Robert, after his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and indeed one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I was not able to tell him that I would not be able to be in the front row," he said.
He had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it was only then that I realized that he was not invincible," she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
At that moment I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better," she said.
This was also the inspiration behind her first choice of song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied her during the preparation for the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, sat out on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad statistic.
Mickelson, who was playing in the biennial event to try to win a record 12th time, was replaced by captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the five-time major champion had to settle for cheering at times and, at others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what was wrong.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is never in his best shape for Le Golf National, where the long rough punishes errant shots constantly.
And if the field is not sufficiently daunting, Mickelson, in the ninth round on Sunday, faces the brilliant Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points down after the first 12 singles, had started in such impressive fashion, Mickelson &apos; s match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, and he could not say much more.
He understood perfectly the role he had today, he gave me a pat on the back and, wrapping his arm around me, said he would be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably did not imagine playing two games.
We thought there would be more, but that is how it came out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass the mark of Nick Faldo for most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a whole career of Ryder Cups that had never been so clearly defined by his individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, but Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He is fun, sarcastic, clever, he likes to mock others; he is great to have on the team," he explained.
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as a support this week; it was fun.
It is much more than just a game."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, even with a substantial advantage in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
Denmark made its debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a Seve Ballesteros-led American team held a five-point lead over the Danes, but in the end only managed to tie the match by the narrowest of margins, 14½-13½.
You keep reminding me that we had a great tournament at Valderrama; we also had a great tournament at Brookline and we lost, we had a great tournament at Valderrama and we won, but by the skin of our teeth," Bjorn said, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead by 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
The history will show that this team is not finished.
You have to give it your all tomorrow.
Get out of here and do what you have to do.
This is not over until the points are on the board.
We have a target to meet, and that is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, and they are the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players had achieved on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is happening tomorrow is individual performances and that is different.
It is great to share what is happening with a partner when things are going well, but when things are not going well, you really test your golfing ability.
That is the message that has to be sent to the players, to give their best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner behind and go and get the best out of yourself."
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be hoping that his players can do better individually than they did as a pair, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points to four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the spectrum in the last few days of these great tournaments and has been part of the team that won at Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."
He remembered every word when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had motivated his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-imports tomorrow, but we have to play as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all move in the same direction, all the pressure is on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and take on Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole trip," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era vessels, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to defective systems and the steady increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman as saying.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery scuppered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-missile missiles, and some technologies of invisibility, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures that are very low.
Among other important features are longer maintenance periods, enabling deployment for up to two years away from the home port.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the far reaches of the world) will already be outdated when they start to serve, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was handed over last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the idea of putting the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that a ship had been returned to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "critical software and hardware defects" that would render the vessel virtually useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half the crew of the former Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has an excessive weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy &apos; s ability to add future updates.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons is twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is estimated that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion), instead of the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of the German navy.
In early 2006, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy was "losing ships that can deploy."
The officer said that the problem had become worse over time, because the old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class corvettes had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new research, carried out in a Highland Scottish landscape, seeks to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that all that is learned will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton's bat and brown long-eared bat from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at strategic locations on the property to monitor bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Experts will analyse the sounds recorded on the tapes to identify the frequency of calls of bats and the species that make them.
A habitat report and map will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be managed for bats and other associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects their nests and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical cabling can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind,
Unless they are nocturnal hunters, their ears are more useful than their eyes in achieving their goal.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The National Trust, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescue operations.
The organisation has even opened the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in Scotland in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
Here in Threave we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and the right habitat.
However, there is still much to be learned about bats, and the work we are doing here and at other properties will help us to better understand what they need to thrive."
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before undertaking maintenance work within the property, as a colony of breeding bats could be destroyed inadvertently and up to 400 females and young could be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, or to destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species about which we know little about their populations."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations as "fake news" and says that people are "using my name to get famous."
His lawyers had been instructed to lodge a complaint against the German magazine Der Spiegel, where the statements had been published.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying $375,000 to conceal the incident, as reported by Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already garnered 142 million followers just hours after the news was released, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," he says, looking straight into the camera.
They only want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but I can't help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," he added, smiling.
Ronaldo &apos; s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appeared in what they called &quot; an unacceptable report on suspicions in the area of privacy &quot;, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount that reflects the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of his personal rights in recent years."
According to reports, the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player &apos; s room and there, Ronaldo, allegedly, raped her anally, according to the documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was &quot; 99 per cent &quot; a &quot; good kid &quot; and that he had disappointed him &quot; one per cent &quot;.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photographs were taken of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and concerned about being "humiliated in public."
The woman, aged 34, claims to be trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a big name in Italian football, on a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: the UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if we lost our position as the global leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without an agreement, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would temporarily stop.
We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of customs delays in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production problems in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the general manager of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without an agreement, particularly in relation to cross-border trade; including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers relate to the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota &apos; s production line is based on the &quot; just in time &quot; method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to house the equivalent of more than a day &apos; s inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted in such an event.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May &apos; s Chequers plan, which sets out the future relationship with the EU, was "tuned precisely to avoid those checks at the border".
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will not only allow us to get through this moment in time but we have to take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.
The evidence from Toyota, among many others, is that we need to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a tremendously successful supply chain."
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, ultimately, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite shop steward there, said that his members were becoming increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they are never recovered."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, White House says
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed for another week, as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Trump campaign and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump might fire the deputy attorney-general or not, and thus compromise the independence of Mueller, has fuelled gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein secretly recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone he himself wore in an attempt to remove the President under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, where the news was that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he &quot; would prefer not &quot; to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the vote in the full Senate.
Trump &apos; s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court."
We will decide on the spot and I will inform the press, as I usually do."
Some journalists would dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the lack of press access was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who acted grandiloquently, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are grandiloquent."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President holds more Question Time than any other President before him, he said, while citing "unsubstantiated" figures that he said showed that.
Press briefings will continue, he said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly to the President of the United States, I think that is much better than asking me.
We have tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when leaving the White House or when participating in public events or press briefings with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
Indeed, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why he was so popular, with an uninhibited and sometimes bizarre performance before the assembled press.
The Scottish Government writes to NHS Scotland staff about their fears over Brexit
The Scottish Government Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in the Scottish Health Service to express the gratitude of the country and its wish to continue working with them post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU nationals working in non-central government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit continued, with the expectation that decisions would be taken this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom Government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know that all this must be very confusing for you.
And that is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each and every member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
EU and other professionals bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to have you with us."
Christion Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head wound
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player, was taken to hospital for emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday, when the Tigers lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
He said, "He came over and fell right there."
Both the coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie at the touchline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him off for a thorough examination.
A staff member at the Tennessee State Hospital told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury or damage yet" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding a total of 18 tackles for the season.
Foreigners will pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreigners will be subject to a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to provide shelter for the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn &apos; s offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the land transaction tax will be imposed on those persons who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year for "homeless"
The additional money raised from the increase in stamp duty on foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralise the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to tax the incomes of the wealthy.
The increase in the land transfer tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivise the Government &apos; s policy to combat begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is an addition to the current stamp duty, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, could reach up to 3 per cent.
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year from this change.
It is estimated that 13% of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not reside in the UK, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country &apos; s most affluent areas (especially the capital) had become &quot; ghost towns &quot; because of the large number of foreign buyers who spent most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping property prices high by buying land in bulk without any intention of using it, and urged Mrs May to abolish the affordable housing levy to solve the "shameful" housing problem in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means dealing with the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the streets is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary objective" is to become a Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited by the prospect of reviving the north-east club, which currently occupies third place in League One (the third tier of English football), three points behind the top club.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only managed to get a B hat, he told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child and it has always made me want to go back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I can successfully manage a club."
Amongst the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he moved from the established names of a big club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, success for me is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club are certainly Premier League standard," he said.
It is not easy to achieve, but I would only consider that I had achieved my aim here if I could return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell in the Hearts technical department.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and helped St. Mirren go from being on the brink of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims that he has never felt more comfortable in his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled that it was probably a 'crossroads' moment when he took over at Alloa.
I always believed that management was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It sounds strange, because it was good, I could make a living out of it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work, but I feel good in the direction.
I always wanted to train and now I have, it is the time of my adult life when I have felt better, without a doubt."

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday
The summer heat wave has boosted profits at struggling British pubs, but all the pressure has been on the restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA, which compiled the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have kept July in line with the pattern of June, when pubs increased their sales by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants have fallen even further.
The 1.8 per cent fall in retail trade in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly serve drinks had their strongest month, against the majority of restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered, although not to the same extent as restaurant operators.
It seems that people only want to go out to drink.
In managed bars and pubs, sales of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent during the month, while meals fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, hospitality and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April."
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the home-based activities market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8% fall in sales compared with last year is going to be particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering industry and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, data is collected and analysed from 47 operational groups with combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media sites, away from their parents &apos; knowledge
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that their parents and teachers are unaware of, according to a survey
The survey, conducted among 20,000 secondary school students, revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages
News has heightened fears that sexually explicit content will be published
20 per cent of pupils said they had a "main" account that showed their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20 000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit content will be published.
One in five students claimed to have a "main" account that showed their parents, while they had other accounts that were private.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter was horrified to see a teenager encouraging others to "violate" her.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters &apos; and Headmistresses &apos; Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland &apos; s most decorated athlete on both track and field and Ian Beattie, the President of the Scottish Athletics Association, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want to see sport benefit from its great international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish, UK and global athletics community, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from having her in its leadership."
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can bring things and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among the four gold medals he won, suffered a transient ischaemic attack, leaving him temporarily unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: &quot; One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I managed to recover fully, I had to learn to walk again and I am now doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the "milking machine" where mothers are compared to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A breast-pump company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is in theory the &quot; world &apos; s first silent breast pump &quot;, consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with a bit of ironic music, showing mothers talking about the freedom they get from the new breast pump.
Four real women dance in a hay barn, with cows, with signs such as "Yes, I do it myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Feed them, feed them, I am feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I am milking my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company &apos; s Facebook page, has caused a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it brings the horrors of the dairy industry to light.
A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they are forced to become pregnant before giving birth in order to produce milk, with the exception that they are taken away from their babies days after giving birth," wrote one person.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly incorporated into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: &quot; Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to announce a breast pump for mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a ridiculous announcement."
However, other people defended the announcement, including a woman who admitted that the song was "distasteful."
I think that is a great idea.
If she were still breastfeeding, I would have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit over the top, but I am not going to dwell on it.
It is a great product, a woman told us.
Another person commented: &quot; It is a funny announcement for mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor criticizes the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside their brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who express milk with a pump say that they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the nursing bra, allowing its users to move, hold their babies and even go out into the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother partner and ECD, tells us: &quot; Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and lactating cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new breast pump offers.
This is not the first time that Elvie has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied immigrant children discreetly relocated to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained unaccompanied minors has increased significantly, despite the fact that the monthly inflow at the border has remained at the usual levels. In part, this is due to the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are making it difficult to find sponsors for these children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal records.
Around 80 per cent of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
We are still pursuing these individuals,” said Albence.
In their rush to prosecute juveniles more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from the date of arrest, rather than 60 days, as the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to workers at reception centres and reports from the system over the past months, the longer they are held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the defenders, these concerns are even more acute in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of distress in these children will be overlooked.
Furthermore, the transfer to the camp without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma, which many of them are already suffering from.
Syria calls on the "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country &apos; s war has been in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Vice-Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue would be "handled accordingly."
“They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorist groups and any foreign presence that is illegal."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advising the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were in place for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for "planting irrational fears" that made refugees decide to remain outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They were "politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats assert that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault on Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who will be "eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations special envoy, was expected to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-conflict constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, arguing that the panel &apos; s work should be restricted to &quot; reviewing the articles of the current constitution &quot; and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will doubtless hope, a premature impeachment or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would be "the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!"
There are no signs of fatigue among the spectators at the moment.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC have doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million, respectively, during the peak audience hours.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in the top-rated time slot, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has surpassed cable channels with 3.5 million viewers for the top-rated nightly news programs.
“It &apos; s an odd attraction that we &apos; re still trying to understand,” says Neal Baer, the show &apos; s executive producer, “Designated Survivor,” a dramatic ABC series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He recalled a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why, he asked.
Because it made him laugh, Scovell was told.
Chaos is always rife in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of families being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
But the information overloads you when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of “deep background” sources by Bob Woodward for his book “Fear,” the $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket of Paul Manafort (“a piece of over-the-top vanity,” in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels &apos; s lurid descriptions of Trump &apos; s anatomy.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it is partly what makes everything seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars” and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he talks about the alternating show of Trump and his daily twists in the plot (whether it be going head-to-head with the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
I remember when in those days we were doing all these crazy programmes and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization, Fleiss recalls.
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows into the most tightly contested midterm elections in the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the influx of money is coming into the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the redistricting of a district in the Congress with two candidates seeking re-election to the same seat.
This residential district in Pittsburg, whose structure was recently redesigned, is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another Republican challenger, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps significantly with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding battle between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
The name of Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight Washington &apos; s disapproval.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Organization Trump evicted the Organization &apos; s management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As the internal meetings progressed, the American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials in the administration made it clear that their intention was that the conference should go ahead, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October and seen by diplomats as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or reprisals from Washington.
A White House spokesman rejected comment on the details of the discussion described by the three United States officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of the special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which there is already substantial evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating the possibility that the Trump campaign was working in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable by that chamber, just as he is preparing to run again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and I am not suggesting that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his European equivalents.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans are now facing several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good place since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the President and speculating about his unfitness for office.
Rosenstein says that The Times &apos; explanation is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
On top of all this, will we vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will be facing a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador &apos; s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles at the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until Rangers drew 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that the result can act as a springboard for bigger things.
We managed to get a good result, as Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing we could get something and we ended up with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and we were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get all three points, but it will be a tough game because they did well in the previous game. But with all the support from the crowd, I am sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be all right.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying themselves immensely and we are having a good training session.
I hope that we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
The fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their relatives.
Around half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said that they did talk to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the steps to have that conversation, says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Include your financial adviser in the conversion, as he may also be able to help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Their options for long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover costs or insure themselves with their own savings, as long as they have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Ensure that a medical power of attorney is obtained to appoint a trusted person to oversee his/her medical care and ensure that professionals are aware of his/her wishes in the event that he/she is unable to communicate.
It can also prepare a power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don &apos; t forget the little details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
"It is not just money that is at stake: who do you treat?" asks Martin.
What medicines are you taking?
Who will look after the dog?
Everything has to be planned.”
Several shots fired at a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They have shot at a man with a rifle several times as he was walking home after leaving his house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (BST), as a "random act."
The victim did not see her assailant.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police had appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications blocked, aid workers have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency covers more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the north-west of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is a lower-level administrative region, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on Sulawesi &apos; s opposite coast.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Following is a summary of some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on 26 December 2004 triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of fatalities were reported on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 killer earthquake and tsunami.
This time, however, it did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) was hit by a series of large earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the island &apos; s northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin &apos; s eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, who is running for Vice President, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a statement issued by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin was remanded to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 cash bond, KTUU reported.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he was declared "absolutely innocent" when asked to make a statement, the channel reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, which could result in up to a year in prison and a $25,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the reporting of a domestic violence crime and being in possession of a firearm while intoxicated in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son &apos; s violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communications networks have collapsed and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just to the side of the Sulawesi centre, which is located to the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for a suspect in the New York terrorist attack case
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bike lane attack on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan last October, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
To justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injury, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which federal prosecutors often use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to the prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the notice of claim states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police also said that he had requested that the ISIS flag be hoisted in his hospital room.
He was found not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea with a life sentence without parole, without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov &apos; s defence team had previously requested the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a Tory conference protest.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more by a group of Tories in favour of remaining joining a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers compromise on its feet in the face of the attacks from Brexit supporters, their opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and "chaos".
Leave Means Leave MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now, he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his opposition to the EU, he said: &quot; We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
Also at the rally was Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who told reporters: “I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public at large does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular within our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: &quot; Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises &quot;.
Farage told the crowd that the politicians would have to be made to feel the heat if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make our treacherous political class feel the heat."
We are going to mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards reading &quot; Tories Against Brexit &quot; after the group launched this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for the security problems they had with the implementation of the party during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be called a good Brexit, he added.
Warren considers all options for the presidency
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump &apos; s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
His Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 30th town hall meeting with voters since Trump took office, using the town hall format.
A staff member asked him whether he was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our "irregular" government, and that included a woman at the top.
One arrest for the murder of LSU football player Sims
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University at the start of the day on Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interview, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98m tall player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the moment that Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team orders of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of the picture by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was first into the pits and let Hamilton run in the back of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strongly on the next lap and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton got past after a wheel-to-wheel battle that left the Ferrari driver having to give up the inside line at risk of being passed again on the exit of the next corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 on that day, started from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first race.
He led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and pass Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to recover fourth place from Raikkonen.
It has been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman in letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job in finding the perfect pair,” said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ms. Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were "bad, disgusting people" there.
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false,” he said.
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say "But I didn't do it."
I did not do it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I did not leak it.”
Well, wait a minute.
Have we filtered it? No, we have not filtered it,” he added, imitating Senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that it came from her office.
I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story, said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I did so.
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the President, who during his Saturday night rally commented as follows: "I will tell you something: that was some really bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.”
Continuing with his defence of the Supreme Court nominee who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don &apos; t care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get the power and the control, the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Stars made amends for their Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match at Dundee on Saturday by 5-3.
The Giants took an early two-goal lead thanks to the attacking efforts of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local score before Dwyer restored the Giants &apos; lead.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third defeat in a row for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won the previous three.
Dwyer &apos; s first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) on an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier &apos; s second goal four minutes later.
In what could be considered a very lively opening period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to tie the game at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized with a goal in the 27th minute: 1-1.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the dying seconds of the second half and secured the victory with his team &apos; s fifth goal as the game entered its final stages.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
A traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake &apos; s plane
An air traffic controller from Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after dying in the line of duty to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to rock the area, and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was being severely shaken by the earthquake.
It held its position to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He jumped from the tower control when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told ABC News that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this,” she added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of victims is expected to increase, as many bodies were still under the rubble and many people could not be contacted,” he told us.
Tsunami waves up to six metres high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Assistance and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: &quot; Every minute an ambulance comes with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible with the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesia &apos; s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country &apos; s military: &quot; I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in early this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that one person is missing after the aircraft accident in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had escaped safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening, it had been unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to assist in rescuing the other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The airline and the United States Navy said that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the aircraft had overrun the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very low.
That was "extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes commented that he and other passengers were able to wade through water up to their waists to the emergency exits of the aircraft as it began to sink.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that sailors working on a nearby dock also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the aviation safety network indicates that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A chronology of the night a woman was burned alive is presented by an analyst
The prosecution finished its arguments in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014 on Saturday.
The Department of Justice expert Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used the mobile phone records to link the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Chambers &apos; mobile phone had been with Mr. Sanford &apos; s phone during the time that Mr. Chambers said he was with Mr. Sanford, the police spoke to Mr. Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford &apos; s truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records showed that they had only met one week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers &apos; death, Tellis deleted Chambers &apos; messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "She wiped her life away."
The defence is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be in the hands of the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Acts such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a "racist" text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mistaken text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the claim to a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her shock when she discovered that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” she wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that she was expecting a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Mauritius received his day &apos; s pay and sent it home via Uber.
Mauritius is now suing the couple for compensation for wrongful dismissal with the intention of receiving $350 per day for the six-month position for which she had been hired, but without a contract.
He told The Post on Friday that he wanted to show them that things were not done that way, and added that he knew it was a case of discrimination.
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that the termination of Maurice &apos; s employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they would not be able to trust him after having offended him.
My wife had sent him something he did not want to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racists,” said Joel Plasco to the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was an accident?
To your newborn child?
Come on!”
Comparing the demand as "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
Are you going to go after someone like that?
That is not a very decent thing to do,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still pending, the couple has been denounced by the public opinion on social media, being criticized for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors fear readers will not identify with a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond &apos; s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: &quot; It was hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before publication.
It is very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC page boy before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the children &apos; s book, had hoped that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was &quot; bittersweet &quot; after his father &apos; s death last year.
From Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very calm man who did not like to boast, he said.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if he had a child who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, even though it was not really your achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by telephone
As soon as the plane landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“She would call regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that no one expected her to succeed,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
I then received a call from Nad to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said to him: "Tashi, I love you very much, darling."
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were slowly wearing out and leaving his system.
She had died too soon and everything was going out.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not scream, cry or yell because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand my ground.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was unfolding.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
I bent my head and tears were constantly falling.
It is hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.
Women in Mourning: A Bridge to Suicide Prevention
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers on them for people to call if they need help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I do not want any father to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any place.
However, he left his work before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler &apos; s 11-year-old brother found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried about the impact."
Davis created the cards &quot; so that people know that there are people to go to and people to talk to, even if it is a friend.
You have to talk about it, you can &apos; t keep it to yourself.
Ms. Humphreys, who had been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“He did not say he was depressed or anything like that,” he tells us.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.”
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to overcome it: &quot; It leaves a void in the whole family.
It has left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
I thought if we could really get something like what he was asking for (a limited time, limited scope investigation), maybe we could bring a little unity to it, and he feared that the committee was "going off the rails" in the midst of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to proceed?
It is entirely due to the chronology.
There are only five weeks to go to the mid-term elections on 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans have a bad result, their attempts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the land will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President &apos; s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to secure at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
North Korean desertion figures “fall” with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by human traffickers, had been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on this.
The vast majority of the deserters from the north eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and, in many cases, they are repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations.
This followed the historic June meeting in Singapore between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, which agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea &apos; s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on United States sanctions.
Without US trust, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will never be the first to unilaterally disarm, Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "histrionic" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I cannot help but think that if a woman had acted in that way, they would have said she was hysterical, said Pelosi on her reaction to Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking as he spoke of his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by "angry liberals" who were upset that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her view, Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and the Democrats gained a majority in the House.
She said: "I will only say one thing: if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he will not be fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court he is on now."
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible judgements by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which is considered to be a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
This is not the time for an hysterical person and an impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine,” Pelosi said.
And women must take it up.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and she cannot let it go without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don't think that's all that unusual, is it?”
She continued: &quot; It helped me a lot when a woman who was an executive in some company told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person with whom she was talking: &quot; Perhaps you think I am sad because I am crying.
No, I am not angry.”
And then he continued with what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Crying is allowed as a way out of anger partly because it is not really understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once finding myself in a rage so intense that I was crying uncontrollably. A serious older woman, a manager I had always been slightly afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
He told me, &quot; Never let them see you cry. &quot;
They have no idea that you are angry.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they think they have cornered you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business, which forced her to withdraw from the presidential race, deeply frustrated Schroeder came up with the idea that there was no reason why she should not run for the presidency herself.
"It was not a well-considered decision," he said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they did not need another one.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.”
As the campaign was already well under way, it fell behind in fund-raising, and it was promised that it would not enter the race again unless it raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?”, he asked.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made fundraising difficult and focused on capturing voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
"It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
“Did he cry?”
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still a long way to go before the battle is over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning in early 2018 by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, which will tax half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pledged to match US attacks, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon back down.
To back down would mean ceding to Washington &apos; s demands, but to publicly submit to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the United States &apos; s trade war could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could make the conditions for a sudden economic crash in either country much more dangerous than has been recognized so far is in fact much more dangerous than the audience has recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, associate fellow at the Center for New American Security focused on Asia.
Syria ready to welcome back refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country &apos; s conditions were improving.
The situation on the ground was today more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an effort to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return to their country of refugees who had to leave it because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still 6 million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had supported the insurgency.
Ryder Cup comes to Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last victory in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe reclaimed the crown when the Danish team of Thomas Bjorn won the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, threw his ball into the water on the par-3 16th hole, admitting defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever post a 5-0-0 score since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio García became the European Ryder Cup player with the most wins in the history of the event, with 25.5 points in his career.
I do not usually cry, but today I cannot help it.
It has been a very hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for having chosen me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to retrieve the cup.
It was a team effort and I am very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now it is the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who on Sunday defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a singles match.
I feel an incredible pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is an odd statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, leaving him only one behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to work hard all weekend to find the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf all week.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team &apos; s disappointing performance: &quot; I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we spoil it.
I would like to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Their 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it is our turn to bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.”
