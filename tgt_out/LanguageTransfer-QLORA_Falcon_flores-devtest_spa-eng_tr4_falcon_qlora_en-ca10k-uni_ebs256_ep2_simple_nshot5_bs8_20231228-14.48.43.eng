In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plumíferos, a theory that is already generally accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this bird has a reddish-brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or caroteneous color on the lower part.
Moreover, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed axis, called a rachis, but they do have other feather characteristics (quills and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that the rachis is the result of a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure that presents the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but to regulate temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers maintain that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, although the tail of a young dinosaur is shown, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

In France, elections have traditionally been a relatively low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a cubicle and insert a preprinted ballot into an envelope that indicates the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials confirm the identity of the person who is voting, he or she enters the ballot into the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French electoral law establishes the procedures quite strictly.

Candidates have the right to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, volunteers count the votes under a rigorous supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

Even so, Central American countries imposed tariffs of 80% on the products we manufacture. We treat you.
It didn't make sense to me; it definitely wasn't fair.
All I can say to the people is that you treat us the way we treat you.
A bill was proposed by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill would require that violent video games sold in California be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of the Crown Prosecution Service, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.

Schneider gave testimony via a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his country of origin.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races in addition to the Wednesday competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "No Terminó la primera carrera", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other race, the giant race, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four slalom sit-skiers in the sitting category failed to complete their races and a total of 45 slalom giant sit-skiers failed to reach the classification in the giant slalom.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh was able to recover the laptop and the mobile phone stolen.
Inspector General Adjunto D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."

At first, it was moved to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to the Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Court of the County of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is under custody awaiting the accusation and trial, any witness's testimony can be questioned, as her image has been the subject of a widespread dissemination.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, said: "Journalists seem to be walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is responsible for processing, told reporters that no additional comments would be made until the case is presented to the court.
According to the information that leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also addressed, according to information provided, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the complementary control of pests, the guards had to supervise the shooters closely, since this was monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the NSW Association of Target Shooters, volunteers were recruited for the Association's shooting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge, said that a comprehensive training and safety course was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English initials) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the generalized protests that began in October against the regime.
The protests, at times violent, were triggered by the fact that elections were not being carried out, in some cases since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, which has caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry said in relation to the delay in the Apple report, saying it was "truly lamentable."
Mariana was shaken by a quake at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.

Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, capital of the Philippines, a former police officer of that country kidnapped a bus and held captive tourists who were coming from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers occupied the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his free time, while working at the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday, government investigators were able to recover the flight recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Powder River Runnels said: "Luna was as rare as I was; even more so. I love her and I miss her. I hope she's in a better place."
Since 2008, among the 1400 people surveyed in advance of the 2010 federal elections, there was a 8% increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she considered Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Isabel II ended.
34% of the respondents share this vision and want that Isabel II be the last queen of Australia.
In one end of the survey, 29% of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, 31% think it should never become a republic.
The gold medal winner in the freestyle 100 meters and 200 meters style had to swim in the freestyle style in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned after his complaints.
He could not take any painkillers to relieve the pain, because it is forbidden to use them in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using various hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and support life.
Scientists expect to understand how planets are formed, particularly our own, given that comets have crashed into the Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the beginning of the year and the month before, signing a law that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old radar technology on the ground, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered the possibility of playing the game closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the magazine Science reported on a study that informed about the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, because of the reproductive isolation between a Darwin's endemic pinzón and a cactus-migrating pinzón.
Gold can take on any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can you hammer and roll into sheets, but you can also stretch it until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. So thin is it that it could be used to decorate illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will change depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product analyzed determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. For this reason, a hydrogen ion is the result of removing a proton from its electron.
Mix the dry powders together and, after mixing them, form a ball with your hands that are clean and wet.
A reaction will occur between the moisture in their hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with drainage in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
In some Minoan homes in Crete and Santorini, Greece, there were traces of sewer systems.
They also had public toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope to space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most relevant thing it has done for us is to make our transport much simpler and faster.
Thanks to her we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small felids (which include domestic cats that feed on small prey in much greater numbers than large prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds) that feed on small prey in much greater numbers than large prey.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the big cats that socialize the most and their lives take place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, joined with up to thirty females and their calves.
Generally, females are closely related to each other, which makes them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in a similar way to wolf packs or dogs, with which they share a surprising similarity (unlike the other large felines) in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a complete athlete, able to climb (but not very well), swim, jump long distances and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a fully sonorous roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. In the best case, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will be much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track and find prey (prey) through smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey mimicking their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they come (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island in such a way that they cannot return easily), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than those it had before to be a strong competitor.
No changes have occurred in the original population, which still needs the same adaptations as in the past.
As time goes by, as the population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will not be possible to classify them as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an ineludible and fundamental consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
Plant food is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except for other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth like knives, in addition to another group in the palate, which translates into that anything that passed through it, had no escape.
We don't have the certainty, but it could have been viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurids, and even could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a T. Rex as large as the T. Rex was no threat to it.
While most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails, and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that distinguished them was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and eating while lying down.
It is not possible that the recipes of the ancient Rome included foods that arrived to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
In short, they had no maize, tomatoes, potatoes, cacao, or any Roman of antiquity ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
Temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
In other cases, special towers with a pyramid shape were built, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for its deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
The majority of Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only showrooms that faced the street. Houses were built with stone.
In Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that he took more westward, discovered the island and gave it his name.
Despite this, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
While each country was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you might think that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has the text "Declaration of Independence Original of July 4, 1776" written on its reverse side. The text is written on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that it was written shortly after the battle, and that it was rolled up and stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
While the landings carried out on D-Day, as well as the subsequent confrontations, had achieved the liberation of the north of France, the south was still to be liberated.
His government was in the hands of the French Vichy, which was a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragon was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that forms part of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
Civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and relates to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, as well as to civitas, which means city or city state and which, in addition, determines the size of the society.
States are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization with a long-term generational transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy, and a homogeneous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilisations in their own right.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and since it had no executive or judicial power, the function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to make sure all of its laws were enforced.
He was not authorized to annul tax laws or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval from all states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan there are about 7,000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when the sailors of Europe who sailed through the place registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal region of northern Taiwan in 1683 and declared it as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings in the complex have been reconstructed to allow tourists to see how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and the works continue today.
To illustrate, the most common format for fixed-image photography at the global level is 35 mm, which was the most commonly used film size toward the end of the era of analog film.
Today, it is still produced, but the most important thing is that the dimensional relationship has been transferred to the sensors of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest rational number) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS group) are similar or very similar to this relationship of appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and mockery, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while also allowing for a certain order to be given to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the king to the people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church are reserved for that specific function.
The dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the war began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognized international right and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting at risk, even, neutral ships.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would face a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during World War I, the countries wanted to avoid that situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation letter written by Charles Batchelor (his last boss) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years, between the Hhan and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same happens with the military, since now the charges are based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other people in the working class who were repressed in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured over time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
On the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, and in a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains in the surroundings. From the inside of this cave, one can see and hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BCE, is one of the many pyramids of the same shape and size built to worship the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The "upward arrow" mark is similar to a V and the "downward arrow" mark is similar to a grap or a square without its lower border.
Above means to start at the tip and push the bow, and below means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, while a descending arc is louder and more abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the bow have been made in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Luis Carlos, 4 years old), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a guard executed in front of the queen in Versailles, who was in panic.
The Filipino people paid the costs of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From the beginning, the long-term profits from the exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in Europe in which these events take place is known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (that is, between 1000 and 1300 CE).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The deterministic technological concept includes, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense of that there is a sub-logic underlying the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
One could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new techniques of manufacture are being designed to reduce the cost of owning a vehicle.
The widespread use of automobiles also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography molded people and, over time, customs and cultures developed that were related to that geography, which, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to laws imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered as such in the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began approximately in 400 BCE and extended until approximately 1100 CE.
During the 12th century its status declined, especially due to the return of the Crusaders, who brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The pinnacle of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the way of dressing received a great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the western styles could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of this period was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Agriculture of subsistence is understood as that which aims to produce enough food to feed only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds from the region's ecological zone with crop rotation and other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of the farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality due to social standards and provides them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to this by using distinctive and symbolic style, such as fashion, gestures and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graphically represent the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, bad luck or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of the child's intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children may have suffered traumatic or severe child abuse before being abandoned or fleeing.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived in the wild.
When a child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents (within its physical capabilities) almost identical behaviors to those of the animal that raised it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though learning based on projects should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are going through a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also is the small animated subject of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been too complex for the student to understand on their own.
Children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care or education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family-based system provides a safe space for these children.
The objective of our system of foster care is to offer safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The objective of the family placement is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home of the child before.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and people.
The different features that the Internet opens up give rise to new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of users to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), the authors also detected "personal participation" and "durable relationships" as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of micorexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that, by reading the microexpressions correctly, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of the speaker with precision.
It even suggests that the skills for interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, like domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been proven that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
Mutation involves the incorporation of a new genetic variation; selection removes it from that set of variations.
The segregation and recombination of genes shuffle the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savanna, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available to it.
Not doing so can cause serious problems: stunting growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been the simplest source of vegetable resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except when cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors had solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees do today.
Interrupting sleep consists of waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then falling asleep again after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a softer alarm clock that will make it return to a conscious state, although not completely awake.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will force him to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is related to the amount of tension that is in their body and their spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we are associated. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that blocks the way is our tension and negativity.
While the bases of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread along the path of love Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, the laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga poses, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be cleared, the chakras activated and the consciousness of enlightenment developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the system, process and culture clashes ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that the Polish defense was already broken down on September 17, 1939, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize itself in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost immediately, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, the Soviet-Polish Bilateral Agreement, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since always, the function of the navy has been to guarantee that its country can move its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The Atlantic campaign in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to disrupt this flow.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it had done with the other European countries.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
With the aim of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes started to keep them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasture, often tended by herdsmen who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, the railways had been installed in the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The addition of sleepers to keep the rails in place occurred quite early. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although iron wheels caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767 iron rails were used for the first time.
The first form of transport known was walking. Humans began to do it upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
The ancestors of the Australopithecus did not have the habit of walking upright.
While bipedal tracks have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, join environmentalist movements or even become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, the suffering of the future.
In many cases, it is like the asintomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, due to the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, at a printing house a few blocks away.
Copies were made, during the night, between 150 and 200, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On July 6, 1776, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not represent them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs in the same way as the T-Rex.
Currently, most computers function by manipulating data in the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be found in an open bottle of medicines or cleaning chemicals.
Read the label for information specific to the first aid for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasite insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with the lice, a very developed species to parasitize humans.
The bedbugs and the clothes moths are endoparasites; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is estimated at about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, which includes the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
Studies showed that women have twice the chance of men to suffer from EM.
A couple could conclude that raising a child would not be the most convenient for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guide for the vast majority of scientific investigations.
However, it is not an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide the scientific investigation.
The focus of naturalists and philosophers was placed in the classical works; especially, in the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those on science, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, Western civilization distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in the behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free-running period even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA was a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fungus with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA of the fungus with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take pictures and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place from which they just came.
In this dynamic transfer launcher, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the last two million years.
All are part of society and use the transport systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason that transport systems give rise to such complaints and why do they fail so often? Are the engineers of transport simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be represented approximately by mathematical models.
In order to graphically clarify the flow of circulation, relations were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both planning and design as well as the operations of the road devices.
The first insects to fly were the insects. This helped them evade their enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that are unable to fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Millennia ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon River is the most caudalous and the second longest river in the world. It contains eight times more water than the river that follows it in size.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water that comes from the rivers of the world that flows into the oceans, 20% comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they could never surpass the size or the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian town of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which at that time dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest country in terms of population.
The Italian is used in the Vatican City, both to draft its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language that most people working in the state speak is also Italian, and the use of Latin is usually reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in the Vatican City State are adherents of the Roman Catholic Church.
The basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements like calcium and potassium. Already, there are metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metals.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Because of this, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, the implementation of new writing methods has led to the use of the pencil less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to approach a pencil.
The only question is what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when a heavy cart rolls up a hill. Dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, that is, they tend to disintegrate with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer shell is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the side closer to the volcano because its crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines assert that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up to reach maturity.
These theories analyze what causes some people to want the things they do and what factors of their environment force them to do or not certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On the one hand, there is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
It is difficult for managers in this category to make decisions that are unpopular with employees, impose disciplinary measures, carry out performance evaluations, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from the staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it necessary to change everything that has been done until now by the group and do it in its own way.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This form of behavior often ends up distancing the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical closest group.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than the members of a traditional group, thanks to the possibility of their teams meeting at different times according to different time zones, which, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organization to submit to the process of establishing an organization for learning? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it may be possible that an organization that works as a team to overcome a difficulty in place to a new innovative process to meet the needs of customers.
To make an organization innovative, the leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous focus as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to the research of cognition. They reduce the field of research and give it greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us understand mental processes.
While there is a lot of association with science fiction, artificial intelligence is a speciality of great relevance within computer science, which is responsible for the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
The research in the field of AI implies the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic queries and customer consultations, as well as facial recognition, handwriting recognition, and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-world problems.
Artificial Intelligence is now often used in the economy, medicine, engineering and military, in the same way that it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as a memory album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with a grammar and spelling that are not very careful, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Because students are the readers who most often criticize, the blogger begins to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Likewise, the blogosphere "demands that students be more understanding of the world around them." The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics." (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and has a variety of museums and galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting it from Muskoka and the extension that follows.
These aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
For a comparison that causes great surprise to many: more African Americans live in the United States than Canadians.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and most self-contained continent if we talk about wild life.
The majority of the smallest islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, in large part, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial influence of Europe and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region borders with the Sahara Desert to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their real marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in rejecting men and not fear defending her position (there are cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BCE and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians, who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
Nearby the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist point of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be considered to take stock of the situation in the province of North Kivu.
The city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its gorilla viewing excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To get to Goma, you can take a moto-taxi (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and distant image.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was included in the World Heritage List due to the threat of the sands of the desert.
It was one of the most important stops on the special African Wonders, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, in each of which a different wild life develops.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all the natural reserves of South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
The display of buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong has been compared to a graph of luminous bars that is evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon side, located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where the city's urban development is most densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. For this reason, if you want to see the proofs of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site.
Despite this, the forests are not only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a sanctuary for the wild life and it is estimated that there are currently 400 tigers in the area of Bengal and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those that travel east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Because buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cantilever bridge that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not enabled for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is expected to be in September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will end.
The area that is now the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the indigenous group most important in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá groups, for example, hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spanish began the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to conserve much of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and best players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also see other tournaments and lower-level games in other parts of the year.
At the Argentine Association of Polo, you will get information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo games.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in relation to the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. There you can change your money. It is in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling is accepted in any place within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There are chances that in the outer islands they do not accept credit cards, but they could use British or American money. Ask in advance with the owners to be able to define which method of payment is accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money in the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do it before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
Winter can be deceptive: although it is very rare for temperatures to fall below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the zoo are accustomed to seeing people, the wild life is still wild, so that it should not be fed nor disturbed.
According to the authorities of the parks, it is necessary to maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals.
Although they may appear very docile, the truth is that bears, bison, elk, moose and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors suffer injuries each year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
Remember that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that release a lot of aroma and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American, and English ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. About two hundred Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the state chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, due to the fact that Auckland has two ports. The most famous are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, in the Pacific Ocean, are the beaches of North Shore, which extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most beaches are almost all sand with safe places to swim and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
In the Waitemata Harbour, the beaches of Tamaki Drive are unfolded in the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the local beer most popular and is not complex, but rather refreshing and pleasant.
While there is a great variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transport.
The local water from the grifo is completely safe for consumption, but if it worries him, he can easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of "black coffee" as foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and, there, injuries by any of these causes are rare.
However, he accepted the advice of the authorities, respected all the signals and paid special attention to the security alerts.
Medusas are found near the beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April, north of 1770. In some cases, they can be found outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where the saltwater crocodiles are most active. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
The advance booking of accommodation gives the traveller the peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined packages of flights and accommodation.
They can also keep the reservation in case they need time to think better about the offer, or to obtain other documents for their destination (for example, the visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly through the hotel.
In some festivals, the majority of those attending the events decide to camp in the place and most of the spectators consider that it is a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you should arrive early to the campsite to get a place near the musical events.
