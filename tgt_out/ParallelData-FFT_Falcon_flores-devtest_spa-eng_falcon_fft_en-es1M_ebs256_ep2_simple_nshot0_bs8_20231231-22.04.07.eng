USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee statement and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and their sports can be best served by moving forward with meaningful changes within our organization, rather than by withdrawing certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse of the proportion that the survivors of Larry Nassar described with such courage could have gone unnoticed for so long and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and USOC share the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and enhanced environment.
In the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an adviser and later for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
He advised Carter on foreign policy in the 1976 elections, and then served as national security adviser (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, after Henry Kissinger.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that is already widely accepted, it also provides specific data that fossils generally do not, such as colour and three-dimensional structure.
According to specialists, this animal has brown upper plumage and pale or carotenoid lower plumage.
The discovery also helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed axis, called a raxis, but do have other feather features (hairs and quills), the researchers concluded that the raxis is probably the result of an evolutionary development of these other features.
The feather structure suggests that its function was not related to flight, but rather to regulate temperature or as an indicator of temperature. The researchers argue that, although the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analysed shows features of adult plumage, not of a hatchling.
The experts &apos; comments were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than of a chick.
Yesterday morning, in Gaziantep, Turkey, a car bomb killed two police officers and injured more than 20 others.

It was found that the Sun was governed by the same basic principles as other stars: the only factors that drove its activity within the system were its luminosity and its rotation.
The light intensity and rotation combine to calculate the Rossby number of a star, linked to plasma flow.
With fewer Rossby numbers, the star is less active in terms of its magnetic field.

He did not mention a figure for the cuts and said that they would be made on the basis of China &apos; s economic production.
He encouraged developing states to "not go back to the traditional path of polluting first and cleaning up later."
He added: "Even so, it is not right to ask them to assume obligations that exceed their stage of development, their level of responsibility and their capabilities."
The Iraq Study Group has just released its report at 12:00 GMT.
He warns that no one can give any guarantees that any Iraqi action at this point will halt the sectarian fighting, the growing violence or a tendency towards chaos.
The report begins with a call for open debate and consensus-building in the United States on Middle East policies.
The report is highly critical of virtually every aspect of the current policy of the executive in Iraq, and calls for an immediate change of direction.
It contains 78 recommendations, the first of which is to launch a new initiative before the end of the year to protect Iraq &apos; s borders from hostile operations and to restore diplomatic links with its neighbours.
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who is currently serving as a senator and is the First Lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometres (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she will run for the presidency.
The Teatro Argentino was the place where Mrs Kirchner announced her intention to run for President; it was also the place where she launched her campaign for the Senate in 2005, representing the province of Buenos Aires.
The issue that sparked the debate was the controversy over the budget for relief and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina, which some conservative fiscal hawks tagged as the &quot; Bush New Orleans Accord &quot;.

Although it was a highly theoretical exercise, the programme was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The expected effect would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a gravitational pull on our planet and causes the tides.
The experts concluded that the dark matters are affected by each other in the same way as the regular matter.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in a ring-like structure and consists of numerous small particles.
White smoke can be seen coming from the plant on television coverage.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African Zululandia area.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant &quot; is generating a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate &quot;.
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of the infected were health workers at that hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom he or she has had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total tuberculosis population still appears to be low: 6 000 out of a total of 333 000 individuals infected at a particular time in South Africa.

The first cases of the disease during this season were reported towards the end of July.
Pigs are the carriers of the disease, which then migrates to humans through mosquitoes.
The outbreak has led the Indian authorities to take measures such as deploying pig hunters, distributing thousands of mosquito nets to the population and using pesticides in the worst-affected areas.
The authorities have also guaranteed several million doses of the vaccine to fight against encephalitis, which will allow health companies to prepare for next year.
This year, the shortage of monetary resources and the low prioritization, compared with other diseases, have led to delays in the implementation of the vaccination plans in the historically most vulnerable regions.
In 1956, Słania moved to Sweden, where, after three years, he obtained a job at the Swedish post office and became Chief engraver there.
The number of stamps he produced, both for Sweden and for the other 28 nations, exceeds 1,000.
The quality and level of detail of his work is so well recognized that he has become one of the few "household names" among philatelists, and there are people who specialize in collecting his work.

The infrared images show temperature variations during the night and day, which indicate that the caves are probably there.
During the day, its temperature is lower than that of the surrounding surface, and at night, higher.
While its thermal behaviour is not as regular as the large caves on our planet, which tend to maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with these deep ground cavities, according to Glen Cushing, of the USGS and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed envelope into a slot that indicates the candidate they have chosen.
After the staff member has verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French electoral law sets out the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that no additional ballots are added to the ballot box at the beginning of voting and that only those ballots cast by eligible voters are counted.
Candidates are allowed to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, the volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

The bill provides that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labelled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes the sale of such games to minors with a fine of $1,000 for non-compliance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning to say that Huhne and Pryce would be prosecuted.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take over the business minister post that Davey is vacating.
The date of 16 February has been set for Huhne and Pryce to appear before the Westminster Magistrates Court.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21, were killed. The latter was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka &apos; s weapon jammed as he was aiming it at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, cannot see out of one eye, has a missing part of his skull and his face was reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a virtual link from a United States Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the side event on Wednesday.
The first was the slalom, where he received a "Did not finish first race" (DNFR) along with 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women &apos; s sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the Austrian first-round finisher, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-place finisher, Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four sitting skiers failed to complete their races and a total of 45 of the 117 slalom giant participants failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: &quot; We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer &quot;.
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused persons appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three persons were inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them was injured.
The driver, however, sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services removed the driver of the red Audi TT from the car.
He was initially transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke &apos; s Hospital, Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in custody in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, any eyewitness testimony may be questionable, as her image has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as Scottish justice works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that &quot; journalists walk on dangerous ground when they publish pictures or other information about suspects &quot;.
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, advised the journalists that no further comment would be made until the indictment was served.
According to the information leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve on the basis of the existing boundaries prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after the signing of the agreement, while PA only accepts five.
During the supplementary pest control test, game wardens had to closely monitor the shooters, as the shooters were monitored and evaluated for their effectiveness.
A partnership between NPWS and the NSW branch of the Sporting Shooters &apos; Association of Australia (SSAA) recruited suitable volunteers into the SSAA hunting program.
Mick O &apos; Flynn, who is currently in charge of the NPWS Conservation and Heritage Office, stated that comprehensive safety and training training was provided to the four selected shooters for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the previous CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures designed to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way Martelly responded to widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, which were sometimes violent, were prompted by the failure to hold elections, in some cases since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry commented on the delay in the Apple report, saying that it was 'truly regrettable'.
The Mariana Islands were shaken by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency indicated that there was no damage to the Northern Mariana Islands.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from the Philippines hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolling Mendoza fired at the foreign visitors with his M16.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father &apos; s footsteps and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women &apos; s Hospital in Auckland in the early 1950s.
Liggins began his research into premature birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
Their study showed that fetal lung maturation of the baby could be accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that investigators for the government had managed to retrieve the flight data recorders from the black box.
Compañeros of Luna also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer stated: &quot; Luna was the first Extreme Queen. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman &quot;.
Dustin Oro in Powder Runnels stated: "Luna was as rare as I was, even more so; I love her and miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Since 2008, among the 1,400 respondents in the lead-up to the 2010 federal election, there has been a 8 per cent increase in those who are opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, the acting Prime Minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II was over.
Thirty-four per cent of those surveyed share this view and want to see Queen Elizabeth II as the last Queen of Australia.
At one end of the survey, 29 per cent of people believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other end, 31 per cent believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner was required to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness has been called into question following his complaints.
He was not allowed to take pain-relieving medication because it was prohibited at the Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using various hardware and software and it was made public at the beginning of February.
Comets may have served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets, including our own, are formed, since comets have long since crashed into the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He dismissed rumours as &quot; political gossip and nonsense &quot;.
He is rumoured to be a candidate for the 2016 presidential elections.
NextGen is a system, according to the FAA, that would reduce flight distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year and carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transport will be provided and trains will not stop at Wembley. Car parking and deterrents will not be available.
Due to the concern over the possible lack of transport, the possibility of playing the game behind closed doors, without the fans, was considered.
On Thursday, Science magazine reported on the discovery of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, United States, and Uppsala University, Sweden, reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, even though it was thought to take much longer, because of the reproduction between a Darwin &apos; s finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migrant, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
It can be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched into a very fine wire that can be twisted and woven.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. So thin, in fact, that it could be used to decorate hand-made illustrations in books called &quot; illuminated manuscripts &quot;.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical sample determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Thus, an ion of hydrogen is the result of stripping a proton of its electron.
Mix both powders together and, after mixing, with clean and wet hands, roll them into a ball.
A reaction will occur between the moisture on your hands and your outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with drainage in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some Minoan city houses in Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had latrines in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, since the light from the Earth &apos; s atmosphere distorts part of the light and vision we see.
A giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to give us much easier and faster transport.
Thanks to it, we have today many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below them are smaller cats that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small felids (including free-ranging domestic cats) that feed on small-bodied species in much greater abundance, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular role, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, joined with up to 30 females and their offspring.
Generally, females are closely related to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in the same way as wolf or dog packs, with a remarkable similarity (unlike other large felids) in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a complete athlete, able to climb (but not very well), swim, jump, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The tiger &apos; s roar is not a full-blown roar like that of the lion, but rather a sentence of words spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy hunting small creatures, and will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, if possible. Almost all their prey will be much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) by smell, by smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places, and they move very quietly. Ocelots hunt their prey by matching their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves to a mountain chain or a river, or if it moves to a new island and cannot easily return), it will often find itself in an environment different from that to which it was accustomed.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed, and they still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, as the emerging population adapts to the new environment, it becomes increasingly different from the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be able to be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and it is an inescapable and fundamental consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (which they give off).
The plants feed on solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and also make clothes from them. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, therefore nothing was feared except other Mosasaurus.
His long jaw had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another group in the palate, which meant that anything that came his way had no escape.
We do not know for sure, but it could have been a viper. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and, even, it could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a T. Rex as big as this one was a threat to it.
While most of that food would be quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate some rather unconventional items at banquets, such as boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the lizard.
Another difference was that the poor ate sitting on a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and leaning back while eating.
It is not possible for the recipes of ancient Rome to include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no maize, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of the people by conducting ceremonies and festivals.
The temples had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, to which only the priests had access.
Sometimes, special towers with a pyramid shape, called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his prayers.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just display windows facing the street.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a voyage further west, discovered the island and named it.
Even so, without prejudice to their discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
While each country was &quot; Scandinavian &quot; in its own right, there were marked differences in regard to people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Treasure Island, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That is not true, however, for the back of the document does contain something written, but it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence is inscribed on the reverse side of the document, &quot; Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776 &quot;, in the lower right corner of the document.
Although the scribe is unknown, it is known that the enormous pergamene document (29¾ by 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after it was written.
It is therefore likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
While the landings on D-Day, as well as the subsequent fighting, had achieved the liberation of northern France, the south was still to be won.
His Government had been in the hands of the Vichy French, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders rather than fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the so-called &quot; Operation Dragon &quot; was launched, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of a large group of people living and working together, i.e. a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civitas, which means &quot; citizen &quot;, and is related to the word civis, which means &quot; citizen &quot;, and to civitas, which means &quot; city &quot; or &quot; city state &quot;, and which also determines, in a way, the size of the society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolution War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was the only component.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was a national executive or judicial authority, the function fell to the states, which often did not cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
It was also not empowered to repeal state taxes or tariffs.
The articles called for unanimous approval by all states to proceed with amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often did not attend.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Because of the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an &quot; archipelago &quot; from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company of a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transformation in the indigenous grain production method, with the use of Chinese labour to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty army (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared it a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Government acceded to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been reconstructed to show how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 per cent of Machu Picchu had been restored and work continues today.
To illustrate, the most common format for still photography globally is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the film era.
Today, it is still produced, but most importantly, its dimensional relationship has been transferred to the digital camera image sensor formats.
Indeed, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Thus, the dimensional ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest ratio of two whole numbers) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g. APS group) are similar or closely related to this appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and often scorn, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while allowing for some order in the images.
The most effective position for the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines dividing the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was challenged.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had succeeded in uniting European states despite their different languages and customs.
Its power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are reserved for that specific purpose.
The central leadership of the church had remained in Rome for over a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Soon after hostilities began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated generally recognized international law as reflected in a number of international agreements of the past two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters in whole sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even risking neutral vessels.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany believed that it would encounter a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his last job) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Old China had a unique way of delimiting different time periods. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years, between the Hhan and the Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
After the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which enabled the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military, where instead of basing charges against the army on class, they are now based on rank.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other people in the repressed working class of other countries to face their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave which came to be known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured the test of time, realistically illustrates the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca lies a cave that is totally cut off from the rest of the world.
It is very difficult to find, even if one is sure that it exists, and inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains around it. From within this cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the seven wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Guiza remains standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C., is one of many large pyramids built to honour the deceased pharaoh.
The Guiza Plateau, or &quot; Necropolis of Guiza &quot;, in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built in honour of his wives and family.
The &quot; up &quot; mark resembles a V and the &quot; down &quot; mark resembles a hook or a square without its lower border.
Up means start at the tip and push the bow, and down means start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The rising arc produces a softer sound, while a descending arc is more abrupt and forceful.
Feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that marks on string instruments have been printed there for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of women from the market forced Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king &apos; s sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage fully.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed in Versailles in front of the Queen, who was in a panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the expenses of the war of imperialism of the United States of America in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Philippine Government in Wall Street banks.
Already, superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events took place is usually known as the Middle Ages, between the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that pragmatically encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological imperative to a strict sense that there is a sub-logic driving the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development proceeds along an independent path from any cultural or political influence, and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
One could, for example, argue that the existence of cars necessarily entails the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, and new manufacturing techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread use of automobiles also leads to an increase in traffic accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very much present in romanticism, according to scholars such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography moulded people and, over time, customs and cultures developed that were related to that geography and, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the world, so Constantinople was known as such in feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicentre of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 BC.
During the twelfth century its status declined, mainly because, on their return, the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were given greater value than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of &quot; capital of fashion &quot; was then transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the way of dressing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of this time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their garments.
Subsistence agriculture is understood to be that which aims at producing sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family alone.
Subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of regionally stored seeds with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which continues to be practised in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization from social standards and provide the possibility of generating a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
Members of a subculture often exhibit distinctive and symbolic style, such as fashion, gestures and jargon, to identify themselves as belonging to that subculture.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for graphically depicting the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and regrettable cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild." Some wild children are confined by persons, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the parents &apos; rejection of the child &apos; s severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced traumatic situations or severe child abuse before being abandoned or running away.
Others were said to have been raised by animals and some had lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, it displays (within its physical capabilities) almost entirely the behaviour of the specific animal that raised it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should facilitate and make this process more interesting, the scaffolding goes a little further.
Shadowing is not a learning technique; it is rather a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new software or the start of a new project.
The scaffold can be presented in both real and virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is the small animated paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in software and their function is to challenge, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to master on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education, but it happens.
We can see that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The aim of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The aim of foster care is to meet all needs that were not met in the foster home prior to placement.
The Internet unites and blends components of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The various features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, important findings have been made in the interpretation of micromovements, which are movements in the face of only a few thousandths of a second.
Specifically, it is argued that by reading a person &apos; s microexpressions correctly, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President &apos; s Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, however, evaluate sincerity with accuracy.
He even suggests that the skills for interpreting human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research work in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The mutation process incorporates a new genetic variation; the selection process removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination balance the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of humans, to meet its amino acid requirements from the plant resources available to it.
Moreover, failure to do so leads to serious problems: slowed growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
Proteins in leaves and legumes would have been the most easily accessible plant-based food, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except when cooked.
Animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are, on the other hand, easily digestible and provide a large number of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not surprise us if our own predecessors resolved their "protein problems" in the same way that savannah chimpanzees do today.
Waking up is intentionally interrupting sleep during the normal sleep period and then falling asleep again (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a soft alarm clock that will bring him back to a conscious state, but not completely wake him up.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, which will force him to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in his or her body and mind.
The more relaxed the tension, the more positive the life force with which we are endowed. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our tension and negativity.
While the basis of Tibetan Buddhism is the teachings of Buddha, it has been extended through the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In general terms, laism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy Kundalini (illumination) is activated by yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga, through visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be cleared, chakras activated and the awareness of enlightenment developed.
Cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clash of systems, processes and cultures led to the two countries drifting apart.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought out, through proxy militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Since the Polish defence was already broken by 17 September 1939, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize itself on the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the regions of eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the navy has always been to ensure that a country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while interfering with the enemy &apos; s ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War provides one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did in the other European countries.
Goats were domesticated for the first time about 10 000 years ago in the Zagros mountains in Iran.
In order to obtain their milk, hair, flesh and leather easily, the ancient people and tribes began to keep them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders who were usually children or adolescents, the most popular of whom was known as the shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.
In England, railways had already been laid by the sixteenth century.
Even though the carts &apos; rails were made of simple wooden planks laid side by side, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The introduction of sleepers to keep the rails in place was quite early, but it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were iron-clad at the top.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels and, in 1767, iron axles were used.
The first form of transport known was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
While bipedal tracks have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more friendly lives with the planet, we can join environmental movements or we can become activists and fight to lessen, to some extent, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like treating a patient symptomatically, but if we are not just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and try to defuse them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of mankind, and the problems have intensified because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten copy, signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing office of John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, and are now known as the &quot; Dunlap copies &quot;.
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time, in the yard of the Independence Hall, on 8 July.
A copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his army in New York on 9 July. Another copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap photographs, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
A large number of palaeontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today: they are the birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and talons, lay eggs and move on their hind legs in the same way as T-Rex.
Today, almost all computers operate on the basis of the manipulation of data coded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, which are 0 and 1, and these numbers are known in computer jargon as binary numbers, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be the finding of an opened bottle of medicine or of toxic cleaning products.
Read the label for specific first aid information for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its former association with lice, a highly developed species of parasite.
Lice that kill and lice that infest are both endoparasites; they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
The reported cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States are about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from ME.
A couple might conclude that bringing up a baby would not be in their best interests or the baby &apos; s.
These couples could choose to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to decipher how the world works through the scientific method, which serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not experimentation, however, but a test used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on the classical works, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle &apos; s thoughts, especially those of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the mastery of the Greek language waned, the West distanced itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms present in physiological processes and behaviour are often critically dependent on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been found in almost all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate self-sustainedly and have a free-running period of operation, even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA was a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using fagos, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fly with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA of the fly with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected gene segment and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation may have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, while those occurring elsewhere can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism often attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife.
Possible activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying information on the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, take pictures and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and often meet people whose jobs are located in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transfer system, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a system of transport based on the use of private cars.
Today, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the past two million years.
They are all part of society and use transport systems; and almost all of them complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear such levels of complaints about water quality or bridge collapse.
What is the reason for such a high level of complaints about transport systems and why do failures occur daily? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is there something more substantial going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of the interactions between them.
It is unfortunately not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to behave relatively consistently, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and to be subject to approximate mathematical representation.
In order to graphically depict the flow of movement, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Such relationships facilitate both the planning and design of road infrastructure and the operations of road infrastructure.
The first to take to the air were the insects, which this helped to evade enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, pressing them against the sides of their bodies.
This provides them with a larger range of possible small hiding places from predators.
Currently, only the Anisoptera and Ephemeroptera are unable to fold their wings.
Millennia ago, a man called Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, including the Sun and other stars.
That seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, is that right?
The Amazon is the world &apos; s largest river in terms of volume and the second largest in terms of length.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, in some places up to six miles wide.
Of the total water from the world &apos; s rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 per cent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6,387 kilometres (3,990 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of construction of the pyramids of Guiza.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the world &apos; s smallest independent country and the smallest in population.
Italian is used in the Vatican City both for drafting its legislation and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by most people working in the State is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since antiquity, since all three can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with crude tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but at the same time it had the theory that they transformed into new substances that formed the things we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and there are also metals such as gold and silver.
Alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon, may also be present.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
That is why the pencil was so popular when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the use of the pencil has decreased and its status has been lost.
Nowadays, people write messages on their computer screens, and they do not even need to get up to get a pen.
Only time will tell what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill, and by dividing the nucleus again it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to decompose with the minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the near side because its crust is thinner, allowing the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up to maturity.
These theories analyse what causes people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two well-known theories are Maslow &apos; s hierarchy of needs and Herzberg &apos; s two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour when managers start to lead their former peers. On one side of the spectrum is the attempt to continue to be &quot; one of the boys &quot; (or girls).
Managers at this level have difficulty making decisions that are unpopular with employees, imposing disciplinary measures, conducting performance appraisals, assigning responsibilities and holding staff accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes that everything that the group has been doing up to now must be changed and done in his or her own way.
In the end, the ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the team lies with the leader.
This often leads to a distance between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that are applied to conventional teams are applied to virtual teams, although there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their physical team.
They generally enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, as their teams can meet at different times, which may not be convenient for local management.
The existence of a &quot; real invisible team &quot; (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The &quot; invisible team &quot; is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets standards for each member.
What motivation could an organization have to submit itself to the learning organization-building process? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to drive innovation.
When all available resources are used appropriately in an organization &apos; s operational departments, there is room for creativity and ingenuity.
The result may be a process of an organization that works as a team to overcome a location difficulty to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate an innovation culture, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, thus reducing the field of research and increasing its accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour contributes to the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the advent of new technologies, we have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with ample information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant field within computing, which deals with intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnostic queries and client consultations, as well as facial, handwriting and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering and military, just as it was incorporated in various software applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or view beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on an exit and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet Elementary School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital and each year the page is updated, but previous versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with a lack of grammar and spelling, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger starts to work on his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogs also require students to be more worldly-wise than their teachers. The need to engage the audience inspires them to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs can &quot; empower students to become more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, can define their positions in the context of others &apos; writings, and establish their perspectives on specific topics &quot; (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada &apos; s bilingual capital city and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the country &apos; s history and present.
The Niagara Falls are further south and the north hosts the natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension beyond.
All these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wilderness, almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison that is a great surprise to many: more African Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the land by Arabs and imposed to a large extent in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial thrust of European influence and colonialism took place in the fifteenth century, following the discovery by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the route linking Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is advised that all female visitors state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it is not too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not fear defending your position (whether cultural differences exist or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese as the White House, but was abandoned after an earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan Sultan under the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who established their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
There are plenty of places in the old Medina where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as earthenware, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, but everything is geared to tourists.
Goma is a tourist site in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the centre of the city.
While Goma is fairly secure, any external visits should be considered in order to take stock of the situation of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for scaling the Nyiragongo volcano, and its mountain gorilla viewing trips are the most affordable in Africa.
To move within Goma, you can take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has given "Tombouctou" an image of an exotic and distant land.
Although today Timbuktu is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the list of World Heritage sites in danger, as a result of the threat posed by the desert sands.
He was featured in one of the most important stops on PBS &apos; s special, Maravillas del Mundo Africano, with Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands out from the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends along the eastern boundary with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which has a different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African natural reserves, there are daily fees for the conservation and access to the park.
A Wild Card may also be purchased, which allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the country &apos; s national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island itself, which is the destination of choice for many tourists.
The deployment of buildings that define the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glowing bar chart, with the waters of Victoria Harbour as the light source.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head for the Kowloon side of the harbour.
It is in the reclaimed land on the north coast of Hong Kong that its urban development is most densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own, and so if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove coastal forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The forest area within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Notwithstanding this, forests are not just mangroves, but contain some of the last remaining trees of the once mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres and nearly one third of its area is covered by water or marsh.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is now estimated to be home to 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave the district station (across the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m.
Because buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a convenient and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cantilever structure that spans the river, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Under the bridge there is a 15-metre-wide open space, and although the bridge was completed in August 2011, it was not made available for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that is now eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guaraní, who were the largest indigenous group in that region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunters, in addition to practising subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished for subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as &quot; The giant province of the Indies &quot;, was born in the sixteenth century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish initiated the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal idiosyncrasies and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and matches may be held at other times of the year.
For information on polo matches and ticket sales, visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in terms of the British pound (GBP).
There is one bank on the islands, which is located opposite the FIC West shop in Stanley.
The Pound is accepted everywhere in the Islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
There was a good chance that credit cards would not be accepted on the outer islands, but British or American currency might be used. He should ask the owners in advance what method of payment was accepted.
It is virtually impossible to change money outside the Malvinas Islands, so try to do so before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of Ecuador, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the tropics, with frequent temperatures of +30°C during the summer.
Cold winter weather can be deceptive: although it is very rare for temperatures to fall below the point of freezing, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no &quot; rainy &quot; or &quot; dry &quot; stations; the amount of rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild life is still wild, and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/metres from other wild animals.
However gentle they may appear, bison, bighorn sheep, elk, bears and virtually all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year by not keeping a safe distance from these animals, which are large, wild and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted by odours, so avoid cooking or eating food that gives off a strong odour and keep the camp clean.
The capital city of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of approximately 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
All the boats sank, except for a British cruiser. About 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the Mau movement &apos; s war for independence, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the head of state, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as a result of the fact that Auckland has two harbours, and the most popular are in three areas.
North Harbour, in the Pacific Ocean, has beaches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most beaches are sand and are safe for swimming and most have pohutukawa trees providing shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in the flash Mission Bay and St Heliers suburbs of Auckland &apos; s Waitemata Harbour are the scene of the action.
These are family beaches, sometimes very busy, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach, and they are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transport.
Local tap water is completely safe for drinking, but if you are concerned, you will find bottled water readily available.
The Australians consider the notion of &quot; flat white &quot; to be foreign, a small black coffee is called an &quot; espresso &quot;, cappuccino is served with cream (rather than foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year and, there, injuries from any of these causes are rare.
In any case, please take the advice of the authorities, respect all the signs and pay particular attention to security alerts.
Cubomedusas are found near the beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April, north of 1770. They may be found outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them are afraid of people and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where actively breeding salt water crocodiles are found. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers located north of Rockhampton.
The pre-booked accommodation reservation gives the traveller the peace of mind that he/she will have a place to sleep when he/she arrives at his/her destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camp sites.
Travel agents generally offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They may also reserve the offer if they need time to think about it better, or to obtain other documents for their destination (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, most attendees at the music events decide to camp on site and most of the audience consider this to be a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to see the action, you should arrive early at the camp to get a place near the music.
It should be borne in mind that, while the musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival they may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic in winter, find out where the cabin is, because crossing the ice causes a great deal of noise for those who are most affected.
During the cruises to St. Petersburg, passengers also have time to visit the city. Passengers are exempted from visa requirements (please refer to terms).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their customers. There are usually no windows or clocks and exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special food, beverage and entertainment promotions to keep guests in good spirits and within the facility.
Some establishments serve free spirits. Although drunkenness affects judgement and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone intending to drive at high altitudes or in mountain passes must be prepared for snow, ice or low temperatures.
On ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as one would on a dry road.
During snowstorms, it can fall so much snow that it can trap you in a very short time.
In addition, visibility may be reduced by snow or by condensation or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries ice and snow conditions are normal and transit flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely to be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable part of the visit for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to the land-based travel to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.

The stirrups are the supports for the feet of the rider, which hang on both sides of the saddle.
While providing greater stability for the rider, they can present safety concerns as the rider &apos; s feet may become entangled.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but still has one foot in the stirrup, he or she can be dragged if the horse takes off. To reduce the risk, there are a number of safety harnesses.
First, most riders use riding boots with a thin, flat sole.
In addition, there are saddles, especially English saddles, with safety bars that allow the leathers to come off the tree if the rider is thrown backwards.
