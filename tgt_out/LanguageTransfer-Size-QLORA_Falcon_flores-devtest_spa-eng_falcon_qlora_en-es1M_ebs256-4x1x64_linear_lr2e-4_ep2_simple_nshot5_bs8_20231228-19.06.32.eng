USA Gymnastics supports the USOC statement and recognizes that it is imperative that the USOC family create a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of the athletes, clubs and their sports can be best served by making meaningful changes within our organization, rather than by withdrawing certifications.

The goal of USA Gymnastics and USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a positive and supportive environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an adviser and later for the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.
He advised Carter on foreign policy in the 1976 elections and later worked as national security adviser (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, after Henry Kissinger.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that has been widely accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils do not, such as colour and three-dimensional structure.
The experts say that this bird has a chestnut-coloured upper plumage and a pale or caroteneous lower plumage.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of bird feathers.
The plumage of dinosaurs is not well developed, with a well-developed keel, but does have other feather features (hairs and quills), and the researchers concluded that the keel is the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure that presents the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but to regulate temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers maintain that, although the tail of a young dinosaur is the sample analysed, the sample shows the feathers of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, although the tail feathers of a young dinosaur are illustrated, the feathers are more like those of an adult than those of a chick.

The forces of gravity between the dark matter present in the galaxy and the matter of the Milky Way would be the ones to produce the effect desired by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the galaxy of Sagittarius in the same way that the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes tides.
The experts concluded that dark materials affect each other in the same way as regular materials.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy is in the form of a halo and is composed of numerous small particles.

XDR-TB was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in South Africa.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant generated "much concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate."
The doctor believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of the infected were health workers at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with whom he or she has had close contact.

The authorities have also guaranteed several million doses of the vaccine to fight against encephalitis, which will allow health companies to prepare for the next year.
This year, the scarcity of monetary resources and the low priority given to the disease, compared with other illnesses, have led to delays in the implementation of the vaccination plans in the historically most vulnerable regions.

In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a cubicle and insert a pre-printed ballot card indicating the candidate they have chosen.
The voter then signs the list of voters and the ballot is placed in the ballot box.
The French electoral law lays down the procedures in a fairly strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, so that voters and observers can see that there are no additional ballots at the beginning of the count and that only those of the voters who have voted are counted.
The candidates have the right to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, the volunteers count the votes under rigorous supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

The Uka weapon jammed while aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, cannot see out of one eye, has lost part of his skull and his face was reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider testified via a virtual link from a United States Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the Wednesday competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he finished in "No Terminó la primera carrera," as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's field with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four slalom skiers failed to complete their runs and a total of 45 slalom giant skiers failed to qualify for the race.
The MP police recovered the laptop and the mobile phone from the miscreants.
The deputy inspector general, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the Superintendent of Police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused had appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house at the time of the impact, none of them suffered injuries.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, it was moved to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is under custody awaiting trial, any statement by an eyewitness can be questioned, as her image has been widely circulated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the publication of photographs was considered potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted: "Journalists walk on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, said it would not comment further until the charge sheet was served.
The document is expected to deal with the border conflict, which Palestine seeks to resolve based on the boundaries that existed prior to the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics that were discussed, according to information received, included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for 10 years once the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the pilot control of pests, the shooters were closely monitored by the rangers, who evaluated their effectiveness.
A partnership between NPWS and the NSW Branch of the Australian Sporting Shooters Association (ASSA) recruited suitable volunteers into the ASSA program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge of the NPWS Conservation and Heritage Office, said that comprehensive training and safety training was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
The day before, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
A presidential commission advised the previous CEP to step down, as part of a series of measures designed to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, which have sometimes turned violent, were triggered by the fact that no elections have been held, in some cases since 2011.
There have been 60 reported cases of iPods with malfunctioning and overheating, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry was quoted as saying that it was "really regrettable" that the report was late.
Mariana was shaken by a magnitude 6.0 earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency indicated that there were no damages in the Northern Mariana Islands.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported the absence of tsunami warning signs.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
The six hostages, including children and elderly persons, were released early.
Later, the photographers took over the place of an old lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began studying medicine.
She was trained in obstetrics and worked at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland from 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time, while working at the hospital.
The study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that investigators for the government had recovered the flight recorders from the black box.
The Luna fighters also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her."
Dustin Runnels said: "Luna was as rare as me; even more so, I think. I love her and miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Since 2008, 8 per cent of those surveyed in the lead-up to the 2010 federal election have been opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting Prime Minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the Queen's term was completed.
Thirty-four per cent of those surveyed share this view and want to see Queen Isabel II as the last monarch of Australia.
A 29 per cent of people think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; a 31 per cent think it should never become a republic.
The gold medallist in the 100-metre and 200-metre freestyle events and in the 200-metre individual medley at the Commonwealth Games has been questioned about his physical condition.
He has not been able to take painkillers to relieve the pain, because painkillers are prohibited in the Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people checked the discovery using various hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of scientists is to understand how planets, including our own, were formed, given that comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the beginning of the year and the beginning of the month and signed a bill that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He labelled the rumours as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would reduce flight distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transport will be provided and trains will not stop at Wembley.
Due to the concern over the possible lack of transport, the possibility of a closed-door event was considered.
On Thursday, Science magazine reported on a new species of bird that had been discovered in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, in the United States, and Uppsala University, in Sweden, have shown that the new species evolved in just two generations, much faster than previously thought, due to the mating between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be fashioned into all sorts of shapes and sizes.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched into a very fine wire that can be twisted and woven.
It is so thin that it can be used to adhere to another metal, so thin that it can be used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "manuscripts illuminated."
This is called pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the juice of the cabbage will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its pH level.
The atom of hydrogen is formed by a proton and an electron. An ion of hydrogen is the result of removing a proton from an electron.
Mix both powders together and, after that, with your clean and wet hands, make a ball.
The hands will react to the moisture in their hands and the outer layers will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage, connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
In some Cretan and Santorini cities in Greece, traces of sewerage systems were found.
The Romans had public baths with toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to provide us with a much simpler and faster means of transport.
Thanks to it, we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the automobile, among others.
Below, there are smaller cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and antelope.
There are many small carnivores (including domestic cats) that feed on small prey species that are much more abundant, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The success of the zoo is the concept of niche: each animal has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, joined by up to 30 females and their offspring.
The females are usually closely related, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lions have the same behaviour as wolves or dogs, with which they share a remarkable similarity (unlike other large felids) in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, leap five times as far as a strong man, and pull five times as hard.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not a full-throated roar like the lion's, but rather a series of words spoken in a guttural, growling manner.
Ocelots are opportunistic feeders and will hunt small mammals, reptiles, rodents and birds. Almost all prey will be smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track and hunt animals (prey) by smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and are also very silent and stealthy, stalking their prey and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from the main population of which it is a part (for example, if it moves to a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island where it cannot easily return) it will often find itself in a different environment to that which it was used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed, and they still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As the new population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be able to be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable and fundamental consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they emit).
The food of the plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis, and they also offer shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, and nothing else was feared, except other members of its own species.
Its jaws were long and had more than 70 sharp teeth, including a second set in the roof of its mouth, which made it impossible for anything to escape.
We do not know for sure, but it could have been a viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and even could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a T. rex was no match for him.
While most of the food we eat would be familiar to the Romans, they also ate some rather unusual items at feasts, such as boar, pheasants, snails and even hedgehogs.
Another thing that distinguished the rich from the poor was that the former ate sitting down, while the latter ate standing up.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
They had no maize, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a central temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to satisfy their needs by conducting ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
In some cases, special towers were built with a pyramid shape, called ziggurats, to form part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just display windows on the street; houses were built of stone.
In Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey further west, discovered the island and named it.
However, the Eskimos had already inhabited the area at the time of the discovery.
While each country was "Scandinavian," there were marked differences in terms of people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, the reverse side of the document does not contain anything written, and is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence is written on the back side of the document, with the text facing down.
Although the author of the document is unknown, it is known that it was written on a large sheet of parchment (29¾ by 24½ inches) and rolled up for safekeeping.
The annotation is likely to have been added as a label only.
While the D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, the south remained to be won.
Its government was in the hands of the French "Vichy" group, which had agreed to peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fight against them.
The 15 August 1940 operation, known as "Operation Dragoon," saw the Allies invade southern France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together; in other words, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civitas, which means city, and from civis, which means citizen, and is related to the word civitas, which means city or city state, and which, moreover, determines the size of the society.
The cities are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization with a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogenous propagation.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, initially, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its sole component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, since it did not have a national executive or judiciary, the function was left to the states, which often did not cooperate in enforcing all of its laws.
He was not empowered to nullify laws or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval by all the states to proceed to their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second team with the most world championships and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
The most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago," from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed through the area registered the name of the island as Formosa, which means beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company of a base in southwestern Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the indigenous method of grain production, with the use of Chinese labour to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal and western region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this latter region as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control of the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been rebuilt to show how they originally looked.
Machu Picchu was restored to 30 per cent of its original condition in 1976 and work continues today.
The most common format for still photography worldwide is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the film era.
Today, it is still produced, but its dimensional relationship was transferred to the formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to calculate the simplest ratio of two integers) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g., the APS group) are either identical or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing for a certain order to be established in the images.
Indicates the most effective position for the central object, which is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had united the European states, despite their different languages and customs.
Its power, present everywhere, affected the monarch as well as the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be reserved for that specific purpose.
The dome of the church had stood in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy was successful, it violated the general international law and was in contravention of several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain had blocked off entire sectors of the ocean to prevent the entry of ships, even neutral ones.
Germany had received a reduced response to this tactic and was expecting a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude of most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his last employer) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war was waged between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, when thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The consequences of the French Revolution were many, including the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism by republicanism, the emergence of nationalism and the conviction that the country belonged to the people, not to a single sovereign.
After the Revolution, the posts were opened to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same applies to the military, where the charges are now based on the calibre.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other people in repressed classes in other countries to take up their own revolutions.
Mahoma was interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He would visit a cave known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, vividly illustrates the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet.
At the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca lies a cave that is totally cut off from the rest of the planet.
It is very difficult to find, even if one is sure of its existence, as the cave is totally isolated.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains around it. From inside this cave, one can see and hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the ancient Egyptians in the third century BC, is one of the many pyramids built to honour the deceased pharaoh.
The Guiza Plateau, or "Valley of the Kings," in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other smaller pyramids and tombs were built in honour of his wives and family.
The "upwards arrow" mark is similar to a V and the "downwards arrow" mark is similar to a square or a rectangle without its bottom edge.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The ascending movement of the bow produces a softer sound, while the descending movement is louder and more forceful.
Please feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but please remember that the marks on the bow have been made for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the uprising shook the head of a decapitated royal guard in front of the queen, who was in a panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the costs of the imperialism of the United States of America in conquering the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover the bulk of the interest and principal on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
The super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of profit for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which they were founded.
The period of European history in which these events took place is known as the Middle Ages, between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries (i.e., between 1000 and 1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
The deterministic concept is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from the technological imperative to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of cars, and new techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care to repair the damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in the romanticism, according to scholars such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography moulded people and, with the passage of time, customs and cultures developed that were in harmony with the location of that society, and were preferred to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is known today as the fashion capital, so was Constantinople in feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicentre of luxury began around 400 BC and extended to around 1100 BC.
During the twelfth century, its status declined, especially because the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were given more value than goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the Xth and XIVth centuries.
At first, the way of dressing was influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of that time was the introduction of buttons, which were used to fasten garments.
Subsistence agriculture is understood as that which aims to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his or her family.
The practice of subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, practice that combines the use of seeds stored from the region with the rotation of crops or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers in the developing world were subsistence farmers, and this remains the case in many countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization from social standards and provide them with the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Many factors can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a combination of these factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic style, such as dress, gestures and language.
One of the most common mechanisms used to graphically illustrate the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
Some of these children are called "wild" and are kept by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the children were traumatized or subjected to severe abuse before being abandoned or running away.
Some are said to have been raised by animals and some have lived on their own in the wild.
When a child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, it will display behaviours (within its physical capabilities) almost identical to those of the specific animal that raised it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should facilitate and make this process more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new software or the beginning of a new project.
The andamiaje can be presented in both real and virtual formats; for instance, a teacher is a type of andamiaje, but also a small animated sticky note in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is incorporated into the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to grasp alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
The family-based system provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The objective of the family home is to meet all the needs that were not met in the home from which the children were removed.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different facets of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, &quot; learning &quot; and &quot; socialization &quot; are identified as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed that, by reading a person's microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether or not they are lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate sincerity with accuracy.
It even suggests that the skills for interpreting human behaviour can be shared with domesticated animals, such as dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been proven that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes that variation from the set of variations.
The segregation and recombination of genes between one and another generation is a matter of life and death.
It is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of a human, to satisfy its amino acid requirements with the vegetable resources available to it.
Not doing so can cause serious problems: stunting growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been a more readily accessible source of food for primates such as ourselves, but they are not easily digested by us.
The food derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digested and provides a large number of proteins, which contain all the essential amino acids.
In short, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way as chimpanzees in the present day.
The interruption of sleep is intentional and is followed by a period of sleep.
This can be easily achieved with a soft alarm clock that will wake the person up, but not fully wake them.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, the applicant will need to register his/her presence and the address of his/her accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a diuretic) before going to bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person has is related to the amount of tension in his or her body and mind.
The more negative the tension, the greater the potential for finding peace and absolute happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that stands in our way is our own tension and negativity.
While the basis of Tibetan Buddhism is the teachings of Buddha, it has extended to the path of love Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general terms, the laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the energy Kundalini (illumination) is activated through yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga, through visualization of different deities, can unblock the energy channels, activate the chakras and develop the consciousness of enlightenment.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
At two years after the end of the war, the allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would be fought for 40 years and would be fought by proxy, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Due to the fact that the Polish defence was already broken by 17 September 1939, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the area of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were soon abandoned, when more than 800 000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the ability to move its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established in 1949 to provide a forum for consultation and cooperation among the North American countries.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken over Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
The goat was domesticated, for the first time, some 10 000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The purpose of capturing them was to obtain their milk, hair, flesh and leather easily.
Goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasture, often tended by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the shepherd most people are familiar with.
In England, the railways had been installed by the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carts were made of simple wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The introduction of sleepers to keep the rails in place was quite early, but it was not until the 1870s that it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were iron.
The practice became common, although the iron wheels on the carriages were subject to greater wear and tear.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels and, in 1767, iron rails were used for the first time.
The first form of transport was walking, which humans began to do two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Australopithecus did not walk upright.
While bipedal Australopithecus fossils have been found dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more friendly lives with the planet, become part of environmental movements or even become activists and fight to lessen, in some way, the future suffering.
In many cases, it is like treating the symptoms rather than the root cause of the problem.
The world has undergone great changes, owing to technological and scientific advances by mankind, and the problems have intensified owing to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, a few blocks away, for printing.
Approximately 150 to 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the Dunlap copies.
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his army in New York on 9 July, and another copy was sent to London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap photographs, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scimitar claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Almost all computers now operate on a binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are the 0 and the 1 and, in computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
The internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is finding an opened bottle of medicine or chemical cleaning products.
Read the label for specific first aid information for that specific poison.
The entomologists use the term parasite in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with lice, a species that is very well developed for parasitizing humans.
Bedbugs and bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of MS in the United States is estimated at 400 000, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to suffer from EM.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights to allow a different couple to take care of the child.
The aim of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method, which is the guiding principle for most scientific research.
The experiment is not a test, but a procedure used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making inquiries and observations that guide scientific research.
The light of the naturalists and philosophers was set on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those of science, were accepted.
As the mastery of the Greek language waned, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behaviour are decisively dependent on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free-running period, even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA was a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA of the frog with radioactive sulfur.
The type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of DNA, and whether it involves germ cells, can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism often involves visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Possible activities in the area include hunting, fishing, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take photographs and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often meet people who work in the same place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is connected to some sort of transport system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Today, scientists maintain that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humankind for the last two million years.
All are part of the society and use the transport systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason for the complaints and why are there so many breakdowns every day? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent?
The flow of traffic is the study of individual driver and vehicle movements between two points and the interactions between them.
It is unfortunately not possible to make accurate predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which allows the flows of traffic to be modelled in a logical and approximate manner.
In order to graphically depict the flow of traffic, relations were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Such relations facilitate both the planning and the design of the devices and their operations.
The first to take to the air were insects, which were able to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, tucking them into the sides of their bodies.
This provides them with a larger pool of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, only the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera are unable to fold their wings.
Aristarchus of Samos, a Greek astronomer, commented that the Sun was at the centre of the Solar System.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since the Earth does not perceive its own motion.
The Amazon is the largest river in the world and the second longest in the world.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some places up to six miles wide.
Of the total water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 per cent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6,387 km (3,900 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they could never match the size or the sublime technique of the pyramids of Guiza.
The ancient Egyptian town of the New Kingdom was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest in population.
Italian is used in the Vatican for drafting its legislation and official communications.
The language spoken by most people working in the state is also Italian, and the use of Latin is reserved for religious ceremonies.
The total number of citizens living in the Vatican City State who adhere to the Roman Catholic religion is 1,000.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, as they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It was more similar to the states of matter (solid, liquid, gas, plasma) but also had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be the elements such as calcium and potassium. There are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metals, may be present.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of small particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the final point of this sentence could contain billions of them.
The pencil was therefore a great success, and many friends were made.
Unfortunately, the pencil has become less popular and is no longer considered a status symbol.
People today write messages on their computer screens, and they do not even need a pencil.
Only time will tell what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls down a hill, dividing the nucleus once more, releasing some of that energy.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, i.e. they tend to decay with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the side facing the sun, as the crust is thinner and the lava rises to the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These theories hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they have grown into adulthood.
These theories analyse what makes people want certain things and what factors in their environment make them want or not want certain things.
Two theories that are very well known are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
There are two types of behaviour that managers can exhibit when they begin to lead their former colleagues.
Managers in this category have to make decisions that are unpopular with employees, impose disciplinary measures, conduct performance evaluations, assign responsibilities and hold people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, there is a person who feels the need to change everything that has been done up to now and do it his way.
In the end, the success or failure of the team is down to the leader.
This type of behaviour often distances the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional equipment apply to virtual equipment, although there are some small differences.
Virtual team members often operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
They usually have more autonomy than members of a traditional team, as they can meet at different times, for example, that might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of the management and to which each member reports.
What could be the motive for an organization to submit to the process of establishing an organization learning organization?
When the total resources available are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
The result is a process that is team-based and innovative, and that is able to respond to the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first create an innovation culture, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, and thus reduce the field of research and increase its accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour contributes to the research of scientists.
It is well known that several types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumour affect behaviour and cause changes in mental function.
Thanks to the new technologies, we have the possibility of seeing and investigating structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for developing simulation models, which help us to understand mental processes.
While AI is often associated with science fiction, it is a major field of computer science, concerned with the behaviour, learning and adaptation of intelligent machines.
The research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, diagnostic and consultative capabilities, facial, handwriting and voice recognition.
These disciplines have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now used in many sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and the military, as well as in various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study tours are an important part of any classroom.
The solution is technology-based, with virtual tours of museums, aquariums and art galleries.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, the students at Bennet Elementary School in North Carolina design a web page every year about their trip to the state capital and each year the page is updated, but previous versions are kept online as a memory book.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes as they become more aware of an audience.
Because students are the most likely to be critical readers, the writer of the blog begins to work on improving his or her writing, in order to avoid criticism.
The blog requires students to be more understanding of the world around them. The need to engage the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the typical school day.
The use of blogs &quot; can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet contents, they can define their positions in the context of others &apos; writings, and establish their perspectives on specific topics &quot; (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the country's history and present.
The Niagara Falls are more south and north and the natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
These and other features make Ontario uniquely Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wilderness areas, almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that is a surprise to many: more African Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and an island continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the islands by the Arabs and has been largely imposed, in good measure, on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The first European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the route that links Europe with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
A wedding ring will also be useful (make sure it is not too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round and not afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but was abandoned after a 1755 earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
The area around the old town of Marrakech is full of places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as earthenware, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of other trinkets, but everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be considered in light of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla trekking excursions are among the most affordable in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can take a moto-taxi (motorbike taxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
The fact that it is relatively inaccessible has given "Tombuctú" an image of exotic remoteness.
Although today Timbuktu is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included in the list of places at risk, as a result of the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the stops on the PBS special African American Lives, with Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts markedly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east corner of South Africa and extends along the eastern border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which has a different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as a SANParks icon.
As in all South African nature reserves, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also possible to purchase a Wild Card that allows entry to all South African National Parks or to all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the destination of choice for most tourists.
The Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a bar chart, with the buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong being the bars.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon side.
The development of the northern coast of Hong Kong is concentrated in the reclaimed lands.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. If you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world &apos; s largest mangrove forest, covering 80 km (50 miles) from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
The forests are not just mangroves, but also contain some of the last remaining trees of the once-impressive jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swamp.
The Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife since 1966 and are now home to an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the station to other districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those travelling to eastern and easternmost districts (Bumthang) depart between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full, it is recommended to purchase a ticket in advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster bus service, which is comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a convenient and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River bridge is a structure that spans the river, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m each.
Under the bridge there is a 15-metre-wide space and, although the bridge was completed in August 2011, it was not made available for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is expected to be completed by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The area that is now the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guaraníes, the most important indigenous group in that region, who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The region also hosted other aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished for subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "La provincia gigante de Indias," was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal identity and culture.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower-level matches are also held at other times of the year.
The Argentine Polo Association site will provide information on the tournaments and where to purchase tickets for polo matches.
The value of the pound sterling (GBP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands.
There is one bank on the islands. It is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling pounds are accepted at most places on the islands, and credit cards and United States dollars are also accepted in Stanley.
There are no guarantees that the islands will accept credit cards, but you can use British or American money.
It is virtually impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so do so before leaving.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is south of Ecuador, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30°C during the summer.
The cold winter can be deceptive: while temperatures are rarely below freezing, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild life is still wild and should not be fed or interfered with.
According to the park authorities, it must be at least 100 yards/metres from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/metres from all other wild animals.
Although they may appear to be docile, bison, bighorn sheep, elk, bears and many other large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year by not maintaining a safe distance from these animals, which are large, wild and potentially dangerous.
Please remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so please avoid cooking and storing food that gives off a strong smell and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, the island of Upolu, and has a population of about 40 000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the harbour was the scene of a disastrous naval engagement when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the harbour.
They sank all the ships, except for a British cruiser. About two hundred Americans and Germans were killed.
During the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland has two harbours.
The North Shore beaches stretch from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south, in the North Harbour district of the Pacific Ocean.
The beaches are almost all sand with safe swimming and most have pohutukawa trees providing shade.
The Waitemata Harbour beaches, the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, and the central Auckland region are all popular destinations.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather refreshing and pleasant.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia are better suited for shipping.
The local water from the tap is completely safe for drinking, but if he is concerned, he can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the notion of "white coffee" foreign. A small black coffee is called an espresso, cappuccino is served with cream (rather than milk) and tea is not served with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
There are numerous trips to the reef throughout the year and, there, injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Please take the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and warnings, and pay particular attention to security alerts.
The jellies are found on beaches and in estuaries from October to April, north of 1770.
Tiger sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them are afraid of them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where salt-water crocodiles are most active. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers that lie north of Rockhampton.
The accommodation booking in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind that he or she will have a place to stay when he or she arrives at his or her destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through them.
Travel agents generally offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They can also keep the reservation for a while in case they need to think about the offer, or to obtain other documents for their destination (for example, a visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
At many music festivals, most attendees camp on site and many consider camping to be a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the action, then you should arrive early to the campsite to get a good spot for the music.
Please note that, while the music may have finished, in other areas of the festival it may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic in winter, make sure you know where the cabin is, as crossing the ice makes a lot of noise for those who are most affected.
During the cruise, passengers are exempt from the visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos normally make great efforts to maximize the time and money that their customers spend there. They often have no windows or clocks and the exits can be difficult to find.
They often offer special food, drink and entertainment packages to keep guests happy and within the premises.
Some establishments serve free drinks. Although intoxication affects judgment and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Any person intending to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should be prepared for snow, ice or low temperatures.
On ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as one would on a bare road.
During heavy snowfalls, the snow can accumulate to such an extent that it can trap the vehicle in a short time.
Visibility may be reduced by snow or ice on the car windows.
In many countries, ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely to be the biggest attraction in Africa and the most memorable part of many visitors' experience.
The term safari refers to the popular land-based journeys to see the remarkable wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are known to approach vehicles and the standard equipment will allow for good visibility.
Lions, leopards and cheetahs can be shy, so use binoculars to get a better look.
The safari is a popular day trip or weekend excursion offering hiking, shops, restaurants, and more.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with a number of events taking place in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have some complications.
There are different types of travel insurance policies, but since the end of March, the coverage of most of these coronavirus-based travel insurance policies does not extend until July 2020, which is when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between JPY 2500 and JPY 130 000 and that common passes will cost JPY 7000.
Ironing clothes while they are still damp can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board for guests, even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have a pressing board available, or if you do not want to use a pressing board, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Do not let the fabric get too hot, as it could shrink or, in extreme cases, burn.
There are different methods for purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others, several more are needed.
Not all filters are equally effective, and if this is a concern, bottled water with a seal from a certified company should be considered.
It is possible that travellers may encounter animals that are not known to be in the region.
Pests are capable of destroying food, causing irritation or, in more serious cases, triggering allergic reactions, spreading poison or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases, by themselves, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals through the use of their force, are not usually included in the category of pests.
The duty-free shop offers an opportunity to purchase goods that are duty-free and tax-free in certain locations.
Travellers to countries with a high tax burden can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on items such as spirits and tobacco.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike are encountered between Point Marion and Fairmont.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be alert: there are many steep hills, narrow roads and tight curves.
The posted speed limits are lower than those on the sections of road that follow, usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and compliance is even more important than on other sections.
However, curiously, the cell phone signal is much better here than in many other sections of the road such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastries are of good quality and, in Bavaria, they are quite tasty and varied, like those in Austria, its neighbour to the south.
Fruit pies, with apples cooked inside, are common year-round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. In general, a strong cup of coffee makes a good combination with a German pastry.
If you have a sweet tooth, try the Berliner, also known as a Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices and served with meat or vegetables.
We can find "dry" and "wet" curry, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry, while in the south of India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that are spread throughout the country.
However, employed without any other qualification, the term tends to refer to the original cuisine of the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
The cuisine of Java, now available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of dishes seasoned with simple condiments, with a predilection for the aromas preferred by the Javanese, such as peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
While providing greater stability for the rider, they can present safety issues, as the rider's feet may become entangled in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but still has one foot in the stirrup, he or she can be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce the risk, there are a number of safety devices.
First, most riders use boots with a narrow, pointed toe and a tight heel.
In addition, there are saddles, especially English saddles, with safety bars that allow the leathers to come loose from the structure if a rider is thrown backwards.
The Cochamó Valley is the most popular climbing destination in Chile and is known as the "Yosemite of South America," with extensive walls and granite cliffs.

Skiing and snowboarding are popular winter sports that involve sliding down a slope on skis or a snowboard.
Skiing is a popular activity for many travellers, who are sometimes called "ski bums," who plan their vacations around skiing at a specific site.

Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to deal with visa and passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this sense.
Generally, you can move freely within this region without passing through a passport control point.
With a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate permits for each of the member countries of this space.
There is no universal criterion that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects older than 100 years are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit might be more narrowly defined in places like North America than in Europe.
Artisanal products may be catalogued as antiques, even though they are more recent than goods of similar type manufactured in bulk.
Rearing reindeer is a fundamental livelihood for many Laplanders and the culture associated with this commercial activity is important for many who are not reindeer herders.

Transgender persons who have not yet undergone gender reassignment surgery should not be subjected to body scans with their dignity and privacy intact.
The return flow is the flow that reverses the flow of the waves that break on the shore, often on a reef or similar feature.
Because of the submarine topography, the return flow is concentrated in certain areas of greater depth and can result in a rapid flow in the direction of deeper waters.

A fee is normally charged for enrolment in these educational programmes.
Finland is a great destination for cruising: the "land of a thousand lakes" is also home to thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos.
Not all islands and lakes require a yacht.
While the coasts and larger lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Sailing is a popular recreational activity in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are similar, but the ratio is one to forty in the Netherlands.
Most of the exclusive cruises that sail through the Baltic Sea include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
