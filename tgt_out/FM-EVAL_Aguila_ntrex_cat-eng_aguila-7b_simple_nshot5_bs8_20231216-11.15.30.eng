Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned that they “be mistaken for Muppets.”
Some members of the assembly have expressed their consternation at the proposal of changing their title to MP (Member of the Parliament, membre del parlament).
This controversy has arisen from the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
The members of the assembly of all different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may be used as a means of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party has said that to his party, the fact that MWP “rimmed with Twp or Pwp” was a concern.
For readers who are not Welsh: Twp means stupid and pwp, shit.
A member of the Welsh Assembly's parliamentary party Plaid Cymru has commented that the whole of their party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed various alternatives.
The Conservative Welsh MP has said he was open to changing the name, but noted that there was a difference of only a few words between the term “MWP” and “Muppet.”
In this context, it is necessary to say that the letter “w” in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter “u” in Yorkshire.
According to the committee charged with drafting the legal document introducing the changes: “The decision on any qualification to name the members of the assembly will be left to the members themselves”.
The Law of 2017 of the Welsh Assembly grants the Assembly the power to change its name.
The committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with a broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
The committee then decided on the title of “Members of the Welsh Parliament” or “Welsh Assembly Members” (WAMs), which received a majority of votes in the public consultation.
The assembly is suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach a consensus may be a source of trouble for the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the draft legislation on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee.
The members of the assembly will hold a vote on the final legislation related to the name.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country.
The citizens of North Macedonia are due to vote on Sunday whether they want to change the country's name to “Republic of Macedonia”.
The popular vote was decided in an attempt to resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has consistently insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a way of claiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed attempts by this country to join the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
The Macedonian president, George Ivanov, has said he will ignore the referendum on the name change.
However, those who are in favour, such as the first minister Zoran Zaev, think the change of name is simply the price you have to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stopped ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the elderly people I have spoken to say that there was a bar and a church at each corner.”
Today, there is no longer any of the two.
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
“The people have a different way of socialising today.”
“The bars have become a place where people come and go, where people come and go.”
He is concerned that the money from the sale of church property will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that it will eventually return to the place from which it came.
Churches, he says, could end up being replaced by apartments and condominiums with the type of people who won't be of any help for the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white, and therefore the most likely thing they will do will be to close all the churches, as it is highly improbable that the majority of the people who move into these condominiums will be members of these churches.”
All two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in 1880.
The white-collar Congregationalist Church of Christ, which had been established in 1828, left in the early 1930s.
A black congregation that lived near the building acquired the property.
St. Martin's passed to a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, which led a boycott of white-owned stores on 125th Street, one of the main commercial streets in Harlem, which resisted hiring or promoting black people.
The church was destroyed by fire in 1939, and when the parish priest, the Rev. Johnson, made plans to rebuild it, he commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of the Rev. John Johnson and successor to his father in the parish of St. Martin's, was proud that the carillon was “the bells of the poor”.
The expert who played the carillon in July described it as a “cultural treasure” and a “historic instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, observed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carillon in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to the sheriff, St. Martin's did not replace it.
The que sí ha sonado en St. Martin's durante los últimos meses, por contra, han sido las complicadas historias de arquitectos y contratistas, algunos de ellos llevados por los líderes laicos de la iglesia y otros por la diócesis episcopal.
The council, the parish's governing body, wrote to the diocese last July expressing its concern that the diocese "wished to pass on the costs" to the council, even though the council was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
A shark kills a 13-year-old boy in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for lobsters on the first day of the season for lobsters, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 am on Sunday, July 1, 2010, at Encinitas Beach.
According to Chad Hammel on the KSWB-TV of San Diego, he was swimming with friends when he heard the cries of a young man asking for help. Then he and his group paddled to the place where the boy was found to help him.
Hammel concluded that it was the joy of catching a lobster, but then he realized that he was "crying 'M'han mossegat!'"
He had the entire scapula (shoulder blade) ripped off.
“Because everyone got out of the water, I called: 'There's a shark in the water!'”
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in a serious condition.
No species of shark is known to have attacked the ship.
In a news conference, the lifeguard Larry Giles said that he had been working for a couple of weeks that a shark had been spotted in the area, but that it was decided that that species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
The authorities closed for 48 hours the access to the beaches from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Ecinitas to investigate and for safety reasons.
Giles remarked that there are 135 species of shark in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, headquartered in the UK, to enter the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's has decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty departments in their supermarkets.
These huge corridors are only a small part of a considerable investment in the beauty market in the UK, a market that moves around 2800 million GBP and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors lag behind, and will be tried in 11 stores across the country in the near future if the trial proves successful.
The beauty industry is driven by the desire to maximize profit in the retail space that was once reserved for televisions, microwaves, and kitchen appliances.
Sainsbury's is planning to double its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The gammes existing of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with similar brands like those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain is also in the process of re-launching its beauty line, which is now 100% vegan.
The Fragrance Shop, a retail division of Sainsbury's, will open concessions in two Sainsbury's stores in Croydon and Birmingham.
The Internet and the change to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in supermarkets has made it necessary for big supermarkets to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, the stores will look more like a supermarket in an effort to compete with the discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos stores into many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which has served to boost sales of food and hardware, and improve profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt to revive the company's beauty and pharmaceutical departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's and Boots made a joint test of operations in the early 2000s, but the deal ended in disaster when they could not agree on how to split the profits of the pharmacy chain within the supermarkets.
This new strategy arrives after the sale in 2013 of Sainsbury's 281 drugstores to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for £125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have a major role in the global luxury skin care market, as it will expand the range of luxury skin care brands like La Roche-Posay or Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, says: "We've transformed our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers."
We have invested in trained workers who will be of great help in the future when we need to offer advice.
Our brand portfolio is designed to adapt to any need; for other hand, the attractive and practical environment makes us a destination for beauty products and that we are one of the preferred destinations for beauty products.
Furious Peter Jones after Holly Willoughby backs out of 11 million GBP deal
The star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones was "furious" after Holly Willoughby backed out of a deal of 11 million GBP with his business brand for a new lifestyle brand with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the joint venture of home and accessories products.
The business of these two characters was compared to the Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, 37, announced her departure from the show last week.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones furious in retiring in the last minute from the lucrative joint venture with Peter Jones to concentrate on her own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will both bring her great benefits.
According to several sources, Jones was “furious” when the blonde star of television was admitted, during a tensa meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of her empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new agreements with the presenter, for a fee of £1.5 million, involved her having to give up enough time to devote to the Truly brand of home and accessories.
The business had been compared to the Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double the fortune of Willoughby, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private jet to a vacation home outside of the UK.
According to a source: "Truly was the main priority of Holly."
He was destined to be her future for the rest of his life and where he would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to back out left everyone speechless.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Now there is a warehouse full of merchandise at the headquarters of Marlow.
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost millions to the company as a result of the important investment that had been made in products, from cushions and scented candles to clothing and home furnishings, and the possibility of delays for the launch of her show.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones joined the company in March as president.
All three couples spend their summer together.
Willoughby will be the next brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of I'm a Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to the Queen said that “We will not comment on his business.”
Dangerous accusations... and then we fell in love.
He made a joke about the possible criticism he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider “not appropriate” and for having an opinion so positive of the leader of North Korea.
Why has Trump renounced so much?
Trump said, in a tone of mocking the newscaster's voice, "I don't care what the fuck he's talking about."
“I have not given up on anything”.
He observed that Kim had interest in holding a second meeting after the first one in Singapore was declared a great success towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the nuclear arms talks are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean ambassador Ri Yong Ho commented on the UN General Assembly that North Korea has not received a “response in correspondence” to its first initiatives for disarmament.
However, the US continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's view was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea.”
We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now maintain this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: stopping the missile tests, help for the release of hostages, and the return of American soldiers.
He defended his unorthodox approach to relations with Kim.
It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get in this crowded arena, we'd have 200 people trying to get in there.
A devastated island and hundreds of deaths from a tsunami and a quake in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was said to other NGOs that they were not needed.
Despite the over 10% of the population of Lombok having to be displaced, there was no disaster declaration, which is a prerequisite for international aid to be made available.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is rather demanding.”
If you are planning to go to Palu, you should not be surprised if people from abroad are not allowed to work there.
The sr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency, said that the Indonesian government was evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international aid organizations could be allowed to help.
Due to the constant earthquakes that plague Indonesia, the country is still not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although in Aceh there have been built shelters in case of a tsunami, they are not common in other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the case of a tsunami, even if there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Displacing themselves between the enormous number of islands of Indonesia is, in the best of the cases, a challenge.
Natural disasters make it difficult to deliver supplies.
A ship hospital that was docked in Lombok is now heading for Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
The president Joko Widodo had as his central campaign element the improvement of the poorly maintained Indonesian infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government is facing re-election in 2019 with a serious funding deficit.
Joko also faces pressure from the constant tensions of the country, where members of the majority Muslim faith have adopted a more conservative faith.
Over 1000 people have been killed and tens of thousands of people have been displaced as a result of the fighting that takes place on the streets between Christian and Muslim groups with arrows, bows and other weapons.
Observa: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores the equaliser with a long-distance shot.
Daniel Sturridge saved the Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to about 27 metres from the Chelsea goal when his team were losing 1–0.
He scored a goal from the left before firing a shot that went straight into the net.
The shot crossed the area with a great height while it was propelled towards the right goalpost.
The ball finally dropped to the ground and landed on Kepa Arrizabalaga's knee, and ended up in the net.
“I just tried to get to that position to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play the ball up forward so I tried to create the maximum of time possible, so I could get the most possible time to shoot.”
I saw that came Kante, I made a tack and I did not think much, just kicked the ball.
Chelsea won 1–0 at half time after scoring a goal in the 25th minute through Eden Hazard.
In the play, the striker from the Blue team returned a pass to Mateo Kovacic before kicking off from almost the halfway line and sprinting towards the Liverpool goal.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
He then made a magnificent pass in depth, leaving Hazard in the penalty area with the ball controlled.
Hazard scored with a left-footed shot where Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face the Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday, October 3rd at 15:00 at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
The Chelsea, on the other hand, will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia reaches 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to the disaster agency of the country communicated in the morning of Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of the buildings that collapsed due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 metres, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, was completely destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.

The statue of Cromwell in Parliament Square is the last monument affected by the debate around “rewriting history”.
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction of such cultural and religious treasures of England by fanatical followers of the Puritans.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a “madness” and a “history rewrite”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, says: “In the debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace would become a major target.
The iconoclastic wars of the English Civil Wars were not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe he would be sacrificed for the wrong Cromwell's actions during the century before him.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion of the nineteenth century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe deserves to be commemorated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than now, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
If this is a representation of the actual event, it is a matter of debate in historical circles.
The conflict of the 17th century did form the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a figure recognisable to that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A pig kills a Chinese farmer.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a cut artery and all covered in blood at a pig market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, according to the South China Morning Post.
The 30th of May 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a farm in Xining, province of Qinghai, China.
He had travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a piggy-pen door that led to a piggy-pen contiguous to the one he had been in.
According to him, there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the hog had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin had his legs broken and bloodyed,” said the cousin, named “Wu”, according to the evening news of Guiyang.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 am on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by either of Yuan's cousins.
A news anchor said that one of the market's managers was responsible for the pig's isolation and confinement to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, the family of Yuan and the market officials are negotiating a settlement with the family of Yuan and the officials of the market.
Pigs can be very dangerous to humans.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years before, a cow of almost 300 kg grabbed a farmer's tractor and his wife couldn't scare the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba said to the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that blood can act as a “spark” to start a fight.
They like to play.
They are like children, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't have the idea of doing harm.
Only respect is due to them.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosie will bring torrential rains to the southwest of the United States.
According to the forecasters, Hurricane Rose is weakening as it approaches the Mexican coast.
However, the Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States during the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, the winds of a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 am Eastern Time on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that the Rose will move north on Sunday.
While, a depression is forming in the Pacific Ocean, which is currently moving eastward towards the coast of the west coast of the United States. When the Rosa brings a tropical storm to Baja California on Monday as a hurricane, it will begin to leave a heavy tropical moisture in the direction of northwest toward the southwest of the United States.
The weather forecast for Monday will leave up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then the moisture from the tropical depression will interact with the approaching cold front to generate torrential rainfall across the southwest during the next few days.
A number of points, from 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause flooding, mudslides, mudflows, and landslides.
The strong humidity from the tropical weather will produce daily rainfall amounts of 50 to 75 mm/hr in parts of the Southwest.
It is expected that 50 to 100 mm of rain will fall in parts of the southwest, especially in Arizona.
There is the possibility that there will be flooding, as the weather is rapidly deteriorating due to the tropical nature of the rains.
It is strongly advised to avoid crossing the desert on foot in the event of a tropical weather.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become rivers.
The depression that is approaching will bring torrential rains in certain areas of the coast of Southern California.
It is possible that rainfall totals of more than 50 mm may be recorded, which could result in muddy paths and slippery roads.
It would be the first rains of the season in the region.
Rain will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before rain becomes more widespread between Sunday night and Tuesday morning.
The torrential rains will be spreading across the Four Corners region on Tuesday and persist until Wednesday.
The October will see a number of important temperature swings across the US as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain warm.
This phenomenon can cause dramatic temperature changes in a short distance.
The center of the United States on Sunday is a clear example of the differences in temperature between the East and West.
There have been recorded differences of temperature of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The weather is expected to remain hot and humid through the weekend.
It is expected that the month of October will start with warm weather in the central and eastern parts of the US, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the Southwestern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there is a good chance that temperatures will be above the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched the televised confirmation hearing of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million viewers tuned in to watch the emotional testimony of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of rape, which took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
While the impasse political continued, with the radio stations interrupting their Friday programming schedule because of a last-minute turn of events: a Flake-drafted agreement designed for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford said she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in a party at the University of Virginia and tried to remove her clothes in a party.
Kavanagh, in a statement exceedingly exalted, he said he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers watched this testimony on Friday.
The average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not available immediately for other channels that aired the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
He also has problems with Nielsen's office.
It's a similar audience to a playoff game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the leaders of opinion of which have publicly supported the confirmation of Kavanaugh, was the most watched network, with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the whole day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3,26 million viewers.
The CBS network received 3,1 million viewers, the NBC network received 2,94 million viewers, the MSNBC received 2,89 million viewers, and the CNN received 2,52 million viewers.
The interest in the case remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in the play of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican sent out a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on camera by the CNN and CBS the morning of Friday while being heckled by protesters when he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing on the committee.
Flake remained for several minutes with his eyes fixed on the camera while being reprimanded live on television by CNN.
Here I am, before you.
Does he tell you the truth about the country?
They said to him, “You have power, while there are so many women who don’t have it!”.
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator closed, he said that he would have more things to say to the committee.
In a matter of hours, all cable and broadcast channels were retransmeting in live the moment the Senate's judicial affairs committee voted to hold a vote on whether to proceed with the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
Flake said, "I would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee."
Flake was convinced by his conversation with Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake took his decision.
The choice made by Flake had influence, as it was apparent that the Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
The president Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The first British PM accuses critics of “political playing” in the Brexit debate
The first minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the country’s future.
The first British Prime Minister to arrive at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Boris Johnson, the former Foreign Secretary, said the Chequers plan for Brexit was “absurd”.
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for murder of LSU player

Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with murder in the second degree, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made a public video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson.
The police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and says they have Simpson's DNA in them, according to the CBS WAFB.

The department appreciates the assistance of the Louisiana Operative Fugitive Task Force, the Louisiana State Police, the Southern University Police Department, and the citizens of the area in assisting in the investigation that has resulted in this arrest.
The LSU Director of Athletics Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the law enforcement forces of the area for their diligence and for trying to procure justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
Media 1.98 m, he played as a forward and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had a mean of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
The morning of Friday, the basketball coach of the LSU team Will Wade commented that the team is “broken” and that the death of Wayde was “a huge blow”.
“Things like this are the things that make you suffer in all moments.”
A volcano spits ashes in Mexico City.
The ashes scattered by the Popocatépetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The national disaster prevention center warned Mexican residents to stay away from the volcano after it detected activity at the crater and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in a 24-hour period.
The centre was monitoring recent tremors and shaking.
Images on social media of a fine layer of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
The geophysicists have detected an increase in the volcano activity at 72 km south-east of the capital since a 7.1 earthquake hit the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police clashed with separatist Catalans on the eve of the anniversary of the referendum on independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a pro-independence demonstration turned violent and clashed with police anti-riot units.
A group of pro-independence protesters were detained by riot police, who began to throw eggs and paint at them, causing the formation of dark clouds of dust in the streets usually filled with tourists.
On the same day, there were also violent clashes with police, who used their batons to contain violent demonstrators.
During several hours, pro-independence groups sang “No oblideu, no perdoneu” face to face with unionist demonstrators who chanted “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries, according to local sources.
The tensions have not decreased in this region of mindset independentist for one year after the October 1, 2017 referendum was held, regarded by Madrid as illegal but still carried out by separatist Catalans.
The voters chose independence by a vast majority, although turnout was low, as the opposing side boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by entering into the polling stations, leading to violent confrontations.
The pro-independence groups camped overnight to prevent a pro-police nationalist rally.
The demonstration took place, but the demonstrators were forced to take a different route.
Narcís Termes, an electrician of 68 years and one of the participants in the independence demonstration together with his wife, said he had no more hopes about the possibilities of Catalonia achieving independence.
The year last year was one of the best moments.
I saw my parents how they cried of joy at the chance to vote, but now we are stuck.
Despite a victory in a vital election last December, the pro-independence parties in Catalonia have struggled to maintain their momentum this year, as many of their top leaders are in exile or being held in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the pro-police protest march with his phone, and says the conflict has been stirred up by politicians on both sides.
“Tension is rising”, says.
The Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan political leaders jailed before trial in Spain's independence referendum last year, will be a candidate in the European Parliament election in May 2019.
“Running as a candidate for the European Parliament is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government”, says.

The incident took place on Thursday evening at Ballynagard Crescent at around 19:30 local time.

It is also possible that someone has fired a crossbow at the car.
A goal by Menga gives Livingston a 1–0 victory over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingston was the winner.
The Livingston, who this year had risen from the Second Division, surprised the Rangers in the second game of the 18-game season.
The Dolly Menga goal gave the team of Gary Holt a victory, which places them in second place, sharing the position with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team have not won away from Anfield this season. The next match will be against the leaders, the Hearts, with whom they have a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers will receive the Rapid of Vienna in the Europa League.
The Livingston, while on the other hand, has now won six of their last seven games, with a Holt who has yet to lose a game as manager.
The Livingston does not capitalise on his opportunities when he is playing against the direct play.
The Holt team should have gone ahead earlier in the game, as their direct play caused a lot of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened up the defence, but wasted his chance when he found himself in front of the goalpost. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow sent the ball outside in trying to head the ball for a Craig Halkett cross which crossed the goal.
The locals were happy to let the Rangers get to the area, knowing that they could put pressure on the visitors by making them vulnerable to a quick counterattack.
And so it was as the game was drawing to a close, and the score was 1–1, the ball was played to the right wing, and the ball was played to the right wing.
The referee blew a penalty against the interests of Rangers and Livingston made a break down the left side, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined for a pass, which Menga then headed into the middle of the area.
Until that point, the Rangers had the ball, but they found a defence that was impenetrable and a goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, who had no work to do.
The second half of the match was a repeat of the first, with the same result.
The Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor saved with his feet a Scott Pittman shot and Lithgow's cross was saved by Lithgow.
The Rangers devoted themselves to hanging balls in the area of the Livingston, only to be denied by the referee, who claimed two penalties, one for a supposed hand of Halkett to Middleton, and one for a supposed hand of Middleton to Halkett. Both were denied.
Livingston “phenomenal”: analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
A man thinks they were excellent, and are still continuing to excel in this ascending trajectory.
His style of play and personality have not changed much since his return to the top flight, largely due to the efforts of Holt who has galvanised the team since his arrival.
There were a few heroes.
The captain Halkett was immensely effective, while Joe Worrall and Connor Goldson were constantly on the alert for Menga during the whole game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, even though.
Although Gerrard's spell as manager has been marked by some brilliant moments, it is clear that the team has not been able to maintain the level of success he achieved as a player.
They didn't know creating chances (only once they managed to overcome the local defence), and this Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the table, should take it as an alert.
Reception was agreeable to Erdogan in Cologne.
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between the two allies of NATO.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
Erdogan, next, travelled to Cologne to open a new mosque.
Istanbul is the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police said security concerns were the reason for them to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, though a large number of supporters gathered outside the mosque to see their president.
Centenars of protesters opposed to Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also protested while condemning both Erdogan's policies as well as the decision of Germany to welcome him into the country.
All two demonstrations reflect the division of opinions surrounding the visitor, considered a hero by some Germans and a tyrant by others.
Accident de trànsit de Deptford: a cyclist dies in a car crash.

Long Lartin Prison: six policemen injured in a riot.
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at the maximum-security prison in England's West Midlands.
The events took place in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 09:30 on Sunday, and still persist.
Agents "tornado" specialized were dispatched to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight inmates have been involved.
The agents were treated for minor injuries to the face at the scene of the incident.
According to a prison spokesman: "We have deployed prison officers especially trained to tackle a disturbance that has been going on at Long Martin Prison for some time now.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. We have clearly seen that the perpetrators of this altercation will have to answer to the police and could have to spend more time in jail.
In Long Lartin Prison there are more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The prisoner was attacked by a prisoner.
The prison was also visited by police in October last year, when a prisoner was attacked with billiard balls.
The hurricane threatens to strike Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with torrential rains.
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that is precisely what is likely to happen to us early in the week that comes when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the Southwest, with the subsequent risk of flash flooding.
The national weather service has issued warnings for flooding in the west of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, the south and east of California, and the south and east of Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that the Rose will arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and that she will be approaching the city with rain on Monday night.
The Phoenix Weather Service has commented that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or depression in a 322 km radius from 1950.
The hurricane Katrina (2005) landed in Louisiana, 64 km from the border with Arizona.
The latest national hurricane center forecasts of 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where rainfall totals up to 150 mm can be recorded.
Other areas of the Southwestern Desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, could record from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated spots of up to 100 mm.
For areas outside of flood risk, the rain of the Rosa would be a good news, as the region is suffering from a severe drought.
Although floods are a serious concern, some of the rainfall could be beneficial, as the region is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the US Drought Monitor, more than 40% of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, the second highest category.
But first, the hurricane Hester will make landfall in Baja California, Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have strong hurricane-force winds, with a peak maximum of 137 km/h, and is now located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific, which is causing it to lose strength.
The storm is expected to make landfall in the early hours of Monday morning.
The weather in Mexico City is expected to be cloudy and rainy.
According to weather.com, “75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility that it can reach 250 mm.”
After that, the Rosa will head north through Mexico with a stormy tropical force, before reaching the border with Arizona at first light on Tuesday morning with a tropical depression, crossing the state of Arizona and reaching the south of Utah by Tuesday night.
“The main risk we expect from the remnants of the Rosa or what remains of it are very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the desert of the southwest of the United States.”
It is expected that the rains will cause flooding and mudslides, as well as landslides and mudflows in the mountains.
A midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds.
The teenager was found with injuries in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he is now “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
The agents have made a call for anyone with any recording of the incident to contact us.
Trump says Kavanaugh “has suffered the venom and anger of the Democratic Party”
“The Kavanaugh vote is the vote of rejection of the tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “painted the Democratic Party as a party of hatred and rage.”
Kavanaugh denied in front of Congress, contradicting Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual abuse by him when they were teenagers, decades ago.
He also gave evidence in court in relation to his allegation.
The president said Saturday that, on that day, “the American people saw genius, humanity, and courage” in Kavanaugh.
“The vote to ratify the judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds in the world legal profession, a jurist with a long and distinguished career of service to the people.”
The president alluded indirectly to the Kavanaugh appointment while speaking of the importance of the Republican Party's participation rate in the midterm elections.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't run, but I do run.
“For this reason I am fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are “resisting and obstructing.”
The first vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court will be held on Friday, according to a senate aide.
Centenars of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the death toll continues to grow
As a minimum 384 people have died, and many have been washed up on the beaches, as a result of a major earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to officials.
Centenars of people gathered on Friday with a festival being held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six metres high struck the coast at sunset, dragging many of the people to their death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arrived last night, people were still engaged in their activities at the beach and did not immediately run to the safety of the shore. For this reason, they became victims”, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian National Mitigation Agency (BNPB) in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it carried everything it found, including cars, logs, houses, everything that was on the ground.
There are people who climbed up a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, says.
16,700 people were evacuated from Palu.
Photographic aerial images published by the disaster mitigation agency where you can see the amount of damages, shops and buildings destroyed, bridges turned upside down and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the city coast.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Application and Evaluation of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the earthquake's energy release was 200 times the power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical features of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “considerable” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial buildings and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped between the rubble of the buildings that collapsed, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
According to Nugroho, the death toll and damage could increase to 300 km north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were completely paralysed and therefore no information was able to reach the outside world.
There are more than 300,000 people living there.
It is a tragedy, which is a sad fate.
The agency was heavily criticized for not informing of the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, despite the agents saying that the waves arrived during the time that the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building screams for people to warn them of the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts on the sea, destroying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a general power cut across the area, disrupting communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Despite the army beginning to send humanitarian aid in cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, the evacuees still need food desperately, as well as other basic needs, such as medicine and water.
The airport has reopened only for emergency and relief work and will remain closed until October.
The president Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuees in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very bad.
Despite World Vision workers reaching safely to Palu, where they can shelter in tents, the employees were forced to witness scenes of total destruction, as they traveled through the city.
«They said that they saw many houses destroyed.»
It is a disaster.
Although the disaster relief groups made the desolate gesture of starting disaster relief, some people complained that workers were being denied access to the area.
Due to Indonesian regulations, fundraising, provisions, and personnel for foreign disaster relief only can begin to flow if the site of a disaster is declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
It is still a disaster at a provincial level.
"When the government says "well, it's a national disaster," we can start to ask for help, but it's not yet declared a national disaster.
While falling the second night at Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that occurred on Friday, friends and family of the missing people kept the hope that they would be rescued and their loved ones eluded the disastrous narrative of the natural disasters.
Saturday, a child was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended in early this month in Indonesia.
Apart from the Mandagi family, the only other people trapped in the hotel were his students.
As a senior in the paragliding world, I have my own emotional load.
The Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he had sent desperately sending messages to the paragliding competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a grey check instead of a blue double check.
I think it means that the messages were not received.
A group of robbers steal $26,750 from a bank in Newport, Rhode Island.
On Friday last week, a robbery occurred at a Brink's ATM in Newport, where a worker was filling a cash machine with $26,750.
The agent Dennis McCarthy indicated that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM at the amusement park complex and was preparing to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man ran up behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Once you have a name, you can't change it.
He has been known as Ye for a while, and he used that as his title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place before the show's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
The rapper replaced Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the show's creator.
It's a religious word for me.
I believe that is the most used word in the Bible, and the word means you.
So you are us, we are you.
I've changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye, which is a reflection of our good, bad, confused, and confused side.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
West is a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
A Sean Combs has been known with several names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, former collaborator of West, has used his nickname with or without capitalization and in all caps.
The president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, pledges not to use force against civilians.
The president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has pledged never to use force against civilians, when the country is about to celebrate its 50th anniversary of a bloody repression.
López Obrador pledged on Saturday to never again use military force to repress the Mexican people.
The 2 October 1968, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people in a time when student movements in Latin America were beginning to root themselves around the world.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has pledged to support Mexican young people by granting monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
The unemployment and lack of opportunities for young people make it attractive for young people to join gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence research.
«While China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money they spend on artificial intelligence research,» says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. Government have announced measures in the area of artificial intelligence, despite a lack of formal strategy in the field.
China is also planning to become the world's number one in artificial intelligence by 2030.
«Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, since the rest of the world are far behind the US in the field of artificial intelligence, and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the field of artificial intelligence.»

Catalan: 
«Doubling the funding could double the opportunities that the U.S. achieves the next great discovery in artificial intelligence», said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book titled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general director of the Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the American player of Othello in the best-ranked computer and subsequently served as executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated positively previous competitions by the United States Government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would occur to identify the next visionaries.
Many American researchers have to work hard to obtain grants from the American government.
According to Lee, «China does not steal the leaders; it is the companies who steal the leaders».
In the last few years, Google, Facebook, and other technology companies have hired eminent universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said that the task of the United States in the field of artificial intelligence could be sped up by changes in immigration policy.
I think it would be good to automatically offer permanent residency cards to PhD students in Artificial Intelligence.
The July 2017 China's AI development plan is aimed at building a nationwide AI ecosystem.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China grants funds to people of academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation does to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is inferior to that of the United States.
In January, the Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, conceived as a collaboration between the government and industry, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Intelligence Committee.
A further $2 billion is being invested in AI Next.
The Natural Sciences Foundation spends more than $100 million a year on research in artificial intelligence.
While the United States Congress has not acted on the legislation that would create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
The Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve decades of dispute with Greece, which had blocked the country's EU and NATO applications.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbour North is a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the new name, but the opponents of the name change argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the ethnic Macedonian population in North Macedonia.
The president of North Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a campaign of boycott is making doubt as to whether the referendum will be valid.
The question indicated on the ballot paper is: «Do you approve of the question on the ballot paper?».
The supporters of the change of name, including the first prime minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable price to pay for Macedonia's membership in the European Union and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
«Today I've come to vote for the future of my country, because the young people of Macedonia can live with freedom in the shelter of the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of Members of Parliament has stated that they would acknowledge the result of the vote if it were to be decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority in Parliament is required.
The Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred by 13:00.
However, participation only amounted to just 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary election, which was held in 2016, when voted in 66% of the registered voters.
«I have come to vote for my children, my place is in Europe», said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a pensioner in Skopje.
The first Macedonian prime minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum on the country's name, which would open the way for its accession to the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, of 54 years, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with a high head, not a low hand.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can appeal to other countries, like China and Russia, and join the integration with the Euro-Asian Union.
The first prime minister Zaev asserts that Macedonia's membership in NATO will come with a series of investments that will be more than necessary to help the country's unemployment rate exceed 20%.
I believe that the majority of voters will vote in favour, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO.
Zaev said a 'yes' would mean 'confirmation of our future'.
In a poll published on Monday last week, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure lower than the minimum participation needed.
According to a poll by the Macedonian television channel Telma, 57% of those polled said they would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% voted "Yes".
Because the referendum is valid, the turnout must be at least 50% of the total number of voters.
A referendum failure would be the first major blow to the political credibility of the Government of the pro-Western Prime Minister, who took office in May last year.
Mira el vídeo: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, scores after dribbling through the whole Brighton defence
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling nullified the defence of Brighton in the victory of Manchester City by 2 to 0 in the match played at the City of Manchester Stadium, Manchester (England) last Saturday.
Agüero scored a goal at the 65th minute in a seemingly simple play.
The midfielder received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He ran between three defences of Brighton, demolishing everything in his path.
Then Agüero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He regatee a defender before scoring a goal in the penalty area of the Brighton.
Then he made a pass to his left that found Sterling.
The striker returned the ball to the first touch, to the right of the goal, to Agüero, who with the right foot beat the goalkeeper of the Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that slipped into the net from the right side.
"Agüero has a little problem with his foot."
We decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
This is what has happened.
We are lucky that he scored a goal in that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the early lead to the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League title.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play Agüero received the ball in the deep from a crossing from the right.
He made a beautiful pass to the left side of the pitch to Leroy Sane.
Sane passed the ball to Sterling before passing it to Drinkwater on the long-ball.
The forward of the Sky Blues scored a goal before the ball went out of play.
The City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage, on Tuesday, October 18, at 18:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off, there were no real reasons to force an opening.
But Scherzer, a competitive pitcher, is expected to start on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who maintain a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have any chance of playing in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a wild card with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek to win their first division title.
«Even if we don't play for anything, at least we can play in Denver, and knowing that the other team probably plays at the highest level of play, as no one else has this year.
Why would I want to miss this game?»

Catalan: 
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but they appear to be deciding to let Scherzer pitch if he is healthy.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, would warm up on Thursday and make his Sunday rest.
The right-handed reliever has a record of 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking of the importance of Republicans participating in the midterm elections.
All that we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a big one, really big one.
You can see this horrible, horrible Democratic Party, is happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all means necessary, they are shown to be evil, their motives are clear.
They don't care who they hurt, whether it's a human being or a beast. That's what they want: power and control. That's what they want: power and control.
The mission of democrats, he said, is to resist and obstruct.
«This is something that can be seen in the last four days», he said, and he accused the Democrats of being "enraged, sleazy, dishonest and untrue".
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic senator of highest ranking in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which caused a loud roar from the audience.
"I remember his reply: "I am a Catalan."
You leaked the document?
Yes, yes, what?
No, no. It was a bad language expression. That was the worst language body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party has become a united front.
It is intolerant with those who say what they think.
When my local Momentum activists voted to censure me, I didn't surprise me.
At the end, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we have been told that we are not welcome, all for saying what we think.
My colleague Ms. Ryan received a similar treatment because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the censure motion I was criticised for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Similarly, he disagreed with the leaders before him.
In the Labour Party's meeting of Friday in Nottingham, the party's manifesto was announced.
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, the meetings of the General Committee held on a Friday night have always been exactly like that.
Though it is regrettable that this is not the tone of many meetings, it has been for a long time forgotten the promise of more generous and kindly policies, if ever there was any.
The views of those who disagree with the party leadership are judged in terms of whether they are acceptable to the party's leadership.
It began after Jeremy became leader, as he was concerned that colleagues with whom he shared a similar view of politics were expecting him to take a 180-degree turn and adopt positions that I would never have taken, such as security national or the European single market.
Always that I speak in public, say whatever I say, the social media are filled with aggressive messages calling for my removal from the Labour Party, and I am being accused of being a bad influence on the party.
It doesn't happen to me only.
I know I have more luck than some of my colleagues, as I often receive political messages.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who every day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and do not give in.
A disgraceful aspect of this era is seeing how much abuse has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer are that diverse party, and with each vote of no confidence or change in the rules of selection, the party is tightening more and more.
In the last two years I've received many counsels and have been advised to keep my mouth shut, to be more expressive, and that everything would be fine.
But I did not enter politics to do that.
I have been a member of the Labour Party for 32 years, since I was a student, inspired by the negligent government of Thatcher, which left my class of economics students in a state of utter disarray.
I have never concealed my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could doubt that I have no doubts about my political views and disagreements with the current direction of the party.
To those who voted for the motion Friday, I'd say to them that in a time when the country is heading for a Brexit that will hurt homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to lose time and energy on my loyalty to the Leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of not renewing my candidacy or any other interest will prevent me from acting, according to my own judgment, in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's unbeaten in the league.
Two late scores distorted the result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs were deserved winners in this vibrant Premiership game.
The Ayr, who are the only unbeaten team in the league, are the top team in the table.
The final score was a convincing win for the home team, who had a better record in the series.
«The games we've played so far have tested us and we're still unbeaten, so I'm happy with that.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: "Enhorabona per als Ayr, han aprofitat les ocasions millor que nosaltres".
The Ayr try, scored by Rory Hughes, was converted by Frazier Climo, but a yellow card for Rory Hughes, who was loaned by the Warriors for the game, gave the Melrose the advantage of a man advantage and Jason Baggot scored a try that was not converted.
Climo extended the lead of the Ayr with a penalty and scored a try to put the score 17-5 in Ayr's favour at half time.
But the second half started well for the Melrose, with a converted try by Patrick Anderson, which reduced the deficit to five points.
After the game was suspended for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who was carried from the field on a stretcher, and the return of Ayr to the field, the score was restored with a try by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Then the captain substitute Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card and, again, the Melrose benefited from a man more in the field with a try unconverted by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson was booked for a tackle on Climo without the ball, from the sideline, MacPherson scored a try behind the penetrating run of the Ayr.
Climate scored, as he had done so often since the restart, after Kyle Rowe passed a pass to David Armstrong and passed the ball to Gregor Henry for the fifth try of the game.
The star of the series Still Game is about to start a new career in the restaurant industry.
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be heading for the hospitality sector, after being named director of a restaurant with a licence.
The actor, 56, plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, which he co-writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his long-time comedy partner.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan is planning on his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the subject, but a source from The Scottish Sun newspaper said Kiernan had intended to enter the «flourishing sector of the Glasgow restaurant» business.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without a coastline, awaits the court to reopen the route to the Pacific.
The sailors patrol the naval base covered by sail.
The buildings of the public are flown a blue-grey flag.
The bases in the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon River are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right."
To recover it is a duty.
Around the territory without a coastline of Bolivia, the memory of a lost coastline to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century still remains vivid, like the longing to return to navigating the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the International Court of Justice to issue its decision on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the drive, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no doubt, expects with a positive attitude the result."
Many Bolivians will watch the TIJ ruling on a large screen in La Paz, with the hope that the Hague will rule in Bolivia's favour and force Chile to negotiate a peaceful solution to the long-running dispute over the country's maritime access to the Pacific Ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial re-election battle in the year that comes, also has many hopes deposited in the outcome of the vote.
We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean.
Some analysts think that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that, in case it does, things would not change much.
The United Nations based in the Netherlands has no authority to determine the outcome of possible talks.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that the case was not complicated, and the court's decision is final.
Bolivia's cause has suffered a setback in the last four years.
The Bolivian government has seized the issue of access to the sea,
The rhetoric of Morales has undermined any goodwill on the part of Chile.
Brazil and Chile will continue to speak, but it will be difficult to maintain conversations after this episode.
The two countries do not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia at the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making of the court was exceptionally quick.
Bolivia will have a chance to start a new era of relations with Chile, and a chance to put an end to 139 years of disputes, with mutually beneficial results.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crossa.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean".
The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.
North Korea asserts that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless the United States can be trusted to do so.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will not disarm if it cannot trust Washington.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly last week.
The minister urged the United States to keep their pledge made in Singapore.
His remarks arrive in a moment when it appears that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume the nuclear diplomacy that has been on hold for more than three months after the last summit in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a quimera to think that the sanctions and the objection of the United States to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean War can make North Korea kneel.
Washington is suspicious of North Korea's willingness to disarm if Pyongyang does not make significant moves toward disarmament.
Kim and President. Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang will seriously consider the question of disarmament.
Pyongyang is scheduled to host a second meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump in September.
The Paris Fashion Week reveals the latest in huge hat designs, on your way to a street in front of you.
If you want to increase the size of your collection of hats or want to protect yourself from the sun, you can't do better than to look for a sombrero.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of extravagant hats of unusual proportions to their SS19 collection, which was touted as the most bizarre of the season.
This summer Instagram has been overwhelmed by hats that are practically unusable.
The most notable piece of Valentino's was a brightly colored birdcage hat, adorned with a broad, feathery wing.
Among other accessories overdimensioned, there were pineapples enjoined, a hat of a wizard and, even, a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, which were brightly colored, had lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
A creature resembled a diving suit, with a tube and glasses, while a second looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you follow the trends of fashion, you're lucky.
The hats are expected to be worn in the streets.
The hats of the great heights tread the talons of "the Bomba", a large, flat, broad-brimmed hat, with a wing of two feet, that everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The hat that was behind the bow tie was a cult hit on the social media, leading to a hat made of straw that was worn by the model on the beach, almost as big as the dress she was wearing.
The bag of raffia, dark orange, adorned with serrells of raffia and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of the SS19 collection by Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and bags on the main streets in the summer.

Scottish independent schools maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding results in examinations, which is reinforced by the success of individuals and collective efforts in sport, art, music and other community engagements.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SISC), are committed to offering the best possible service to students and parents.
Independent schools are schools that prepare students for further study and for careers in the world outside of the home country.
As a school sector that can design and implement a personalized curriculum, we observe that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will reach his brain."
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.»
This reminder is very important. You can't just rely on English only if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
The recent results of the examinations show that the languages are leading the rankings in the independent schools.
The 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved an A grade or higher.
The data, collected from 74 member schools of the SCIS, revealed that 72% of students achieved an A grade in Mandarin, while 72% of students achieved an A grade in German, 69% of students achieved an A grade in French, and 63% of students achieved an A grade in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support the teaching of languages as vital skills that young people will need in the future.
Currently, languages, like a choice subject, are still treated as STEM subjects in schools.
A survey in 2014 by the Commission for Skills and Competences revealed that of the reasons employers gave for the lack of competence, 17% was attributed to language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important for young people to prepare them for their careers.
Because there are more job opportunities that require languages, the skills of speaking and writing are essential in a world of globalization.
Independently of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a permanent advantage in the future with a lifelong competence in that language.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of adults did not know a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
Because it is important for children to learn languages today.
Knowing several languages, especially developed economies, giving children better opportunities to find a high-paying job.
Scotland has a wide variety of schools with regard to the languages taught.
Some schools focus more on modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
If you want your child to have an interest in languages, you can always choose between a series of languages at independent schools, which have specialist teachers in this area.
Independent Scottish schools provide an educational environment that prepares children to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
The importance of languages in the global commercial environment of today is vital for the future of the country, and that is why it should be reflected in education.
Languages should be considered international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It is well to do.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James will make his NBA debut with the Los Angeles Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait for LeBron James to play his first game with Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
The Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, has announced that James will play his first game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the team's coaches have said that he will play a few minutes.
«They will be more than one and less than 48», said Walton at the official website of the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James will probably play few minutes.
After the Lakers' early training sessions this week, James talked to reporters about his plans for the team's six-game preseason schedule.
I don't need pre-season games in this phase of my career to be ready for the season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube
The president Donald Trump starts a campaign rally this night in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned Trump rallies for the next week, which include visits to places sympathetic to Trump, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for the Supreme Court candidate is in the process of being held, Trump is trying to secure support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the House of Representatives when the votes are cast in November.
When is the Trump rally in West Virginia's Virginia West this night and how can you watch it online?
The rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump rally in West Virginia can be viewed live on the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXQ1YXQ1YQ8
It is likely that Trump will address the audience that he initiated this week with the nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual abuse, while the Senate vote on his confirmation is expected to be delayed until the next week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main purpose of this wave of rallies is to help the Republicans who are running for the November elections to boost their momentum.
The five Trump campaign rallies are scheduled to be held in the next week, with the intention of stimulating volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
«The control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, at the time we head into a season of campaigning.
The rally this night, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw media attention from Pittsburgh.
It will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a candidate for the U.S. Senate from West Virginia, who is getting unsuccessful poll results.
«It is not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls», commented Simon Haeder, a political science professor at the University of Virginia in West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The American team shows their ambition to keep their hopes alive for the Sunday singles matches.
After three sessions of play, the foursomes of Saturday evening probably were the thing this Ryder Cup needed.
The basculing pendulum of dynamic is a sport invention, in which players really believe.
So, what is the current state of the dynamic?
They had a six-point advantage and now it is a four-point lead, so we're in a little bit of a positive streak.
Obviously, Europe has a clear advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more to play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is blowing a little bit in their favor and have many reasons to be cheerful, in part because of the form of Spieth and Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points each.
Spieth has been deadly from the tee to the green and is giving an example.
The guttural screams of celebration continued as he completed his fourth round and made a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas were two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that won the match by making a similar cry, indicating that he believes his team is still in the competition.
«You have to work hard and care about your own party.
It is all that remains to them now.
18 holes to leave your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed star of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair have so far scored four of four and do not make mistakes.
«Moliwood» were the only couple who did not bogey on Saturday afternoon, and also avoided bogeys on Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, and the last nine holes Friday afternoon.
For this result and the way in which his energy seems to flow to and from the heckling crowd, it is firmly established that they are the players to beat Sunday, and not Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
No matter how much you may have done, you can't be a hero in Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson finished quickly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs in the morning, who teamed with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys at the first nine holes sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they never had any chance of escaping.
The Sunday, but nobody can help you get out of the hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch for the interactions between the pairings, the counsels that give and the ones that don't, and the way a strategy can suddenly change.
The European team has played better as a team and will face the last day with a significant advantage, but this session of foursomes has shown that the United States has the motivation to fight that some, particularly in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead.
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable lead after the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday finished with a 10 to 6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulties and leave their record, up to that point, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who was attempting to retain the trophy won by the American team last year, dominated the fourball matches of the morning and led 3-1.
The US team played two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
The team of Jim Furyk needed to win eight of the 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European to achieve four consecutive points, while Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a successful weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they had a brilliant display to beat a deflated Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by a 5&4 still more impressive display.
Woods, who had been struggling in two matches, showed sporadic genius, but has lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play in the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the afternoon singles and fell to a 2 to 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were ranked as the world's top two players, respectively.
However, Europe was not all roses on a day when the weather was pleasant and the wind was blowing.
Jordan Spieth, three times champion of the tournament, and Justin Thomas set a new standard for Americans by achieving two points.
They won a victory with determination by 2 to 1 over the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and, later, won Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup had a team come back from a deficit of four points in the singles, although Furyk's team needed to draw level to retain the trophy.
After two days, he is now second best, but a counterattack is out of his reach.
North Korea denies it will disarm unilaterally "if not for certain signs of trust".
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN Security Council that the sanctions were intensifying North Korea's distrust of the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the General Assembly annual meeting of the United Nations that North Korea had taken "measures of good will important" during the previous year, such as stopping the nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear and missile testing center, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons.
However, there is no response from the US.
"We have no confidence in the United States, and there is no trust in their security.
If Ri had taken the North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "step-by-step" approach to nuclear disarmament, his remarks would have been significant because they seemed to suggest that Pyongyang was open to a unilateral nuclear disarmament.
Ri made reference to the joint declaration that was made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first North Korea-United States summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018, in which Kim committed to working towards the "desnuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with "guarantees for its security".
North Korea has tried to end the Korean War formally, but the United States has communicated that before North Korea has eliminated its nuclear weapons, Pyongyang must remove its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the call to relax international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insist that first nuclear disarmament must be achieved and they increase the level of pressure by increasing sanctions to achieve their goal of coercively achieving their nuclear disarmament policy, as well as opposing the «declaration of war» declaration.
The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a myth of those who don't know us at all.
But the problem is that the sanctions are continually intensifying our distrust.
Ri did not refer to plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned at the United Nations in the weekend.
In place of that, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: «If the involved part in the nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea instead of the US, the nuclear disarmament process of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this deadlock situation».
In contrast, Ri's speech was much more muted, with the UN Secretary-General's role being largely filled by the UN Security Council.
Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea completely, praised Kim for his courage to take such a dangerous course, but he also said that the sanctions should be maintained until North Korea is fully disarmed.
Trump said he did not have a time frame for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
The United States and Russia contend that the United Nations Security Council should reward North Korea for its measures taken.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said on Thursday at the UN Security Council that: «The application of UN Security Council sanctions must continue unceasingly and without exception until we confirm nuclear disarmament is complete and permanent».
The Security Council has unanimously imposed economic sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to cut the funding of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then communicated that he would return to Pyongyang in the next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
He left Pyongyang on July 27, saying that progress had been made, but hours later North Korea accused him of making "demands of a gangster".
In a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the two countries agreed to dismantle a nuclear facility and a missile base if the United States took any countermeasures.
He said that Kim had told him that the measures in accordance that he sought were the security measures that Trump had promised in Singapore, and actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
The students of Harvard take a course on habits of rest.
This year, Harvard students have been able to sleep more, in an effort to combat the culture of studying overnight, stimulated by caffeine.
A scholar observed that students at the number one university in the world are often unprepared for the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Medicine of the Sleep at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said: “Why are you telling me all this now, in my last year?”
He said he had never heard of the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students learn the basics of good sleep habits that improve academic and sporting performance, as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the health services of the University, said that the university introduced the course after they learned that some students suffered from a severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, which lasts one hour, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a bedroom, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes, and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, on how it affects sport performance, and on the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
In a different section, you are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with icons shows your daily route.
We know that students' conduct will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects that smoking smoked tobacco has on health.
The culture of the pride of keeping one's eyes open all night long still exists, he said, and he added that the pressure on students is increasing, and the pressure on students is a big problem.
Students should ensure a good sleep quality during enough time to be an "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue, boredom and anxiety, it is even said to help students avoid gaining weight, as the brain in starvation mode is in a state of inanició and always has a hunger.
Raymond So, a California Californian of 19 years who studies Chemistry and Physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes the last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course in the whole campus.
The next step, he says, is to ask graduate students to do a program of study similar to that of the Ivy League before they join the institution.
The professor Czeisler recommended students to consider putting an alert on when they went to bed and when they woke up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by computers and LED lights, which can disrupt the rhythm of the circadian rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal by Menga kills the Rangers
The goal by Dolly Menga condemns the disbanded team of Steven Gerrard to a 1-0 home defeat by Livingston, which is another defeat away from home.
The Rangers were looking to get their first win away from Ibrox since February, when they beat St Johnstone 4–1, but the team of Gary Holt suffered their second defeat in 18 games under his management to leave them 8 points behind the leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half time, and it looked as if the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equalise the score.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rise to third place, behind Hibernian by goal difference.
The Rangers could face more difficulties after, as they could be faced with more difficulties after, as the referee Calum Spence needed medical attention after a blow to the head from an object that appeared to be thrown from the crowd.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, kept the same eleven that started a point against the Hearts last week. Maybe he was satisfied with the way his team, well organised, managed to keep his opponents at bay.
If the Rangers had the ball, they dominated possession, but the Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
De fet, they should have marked at two minutes of play, when the first intervention of Menga left Scot Pittman alone before Allan McGregor, but the midfielder's shot went wide and he deservedly missed out on the great chance.
A powerful free kick by Keaghan Jacobs hit the captain Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow's shot was saved by the goalkeeper.
The Rangers took control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final quarter.
Alfredo Morelos believed that he should have had a penalty at the fifteen minute mark, as he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian claims.
The Rangers only managed two shots on target in the first half, but the first goalkeeper of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with the headed goal from Lassana Coulibaly and the easy strike from Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi the 34th minute could have been against the pace, nobody can deny that they deserved it only for their effort.
The Rangers once again failed to break the record.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard made a substitution in the break, changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change had an immediate impact, as the midfielder made a pass to Morelos, despite Kelly running the block.
They did not, however, stop playing the game as they had enjoyed it, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to play the game exactly as they liked, passing the ball long after long.
The band of Holt could have ceded control to the stages, but McGregor remained firm in refusing Jacobs before Lithgow's shot was saved by a corner.
The replacement for the Rangers Glenn Middleton still asked for a penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson did not punish him.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter.
Now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, counting 136 years and counting... the day in which the future Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to the invention of the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which is a pillar of science since then, also became a pop culture icon, as in the 1950 movie "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, a cowboy duo who were physically disabled but seemed to have superhuman strength.
Home: "What is this thing?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactive decay on the minerals.
Evans: "I'm sure he's blowing up now!"
"Hans Geiger" died on his 63rd birthday, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy cancer cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab.
You can “see” a common protein in many cancers, and then reinject them.
A vaccine trial is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the cancer disappear after 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, subsequently, returning them to inject them.
According to the professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (United States): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein “favors the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, has explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them to treat cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into a heated argument with MAGA after his SNL performance.
He did not finish well.
Kanye West was heckled during a live performance on Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat from the Make America Great Again campaign, he began to criticize Democrats and to reiterate his support for Trump.
"Always that I talk with white people I say: How can you like Trump if he is racist?
I'd rather not be concerned about racism, I'd rather have gone a long time ago.
The SNL parody of Matt Damon, in which the star of Hollywood mocksed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Committee on the Judiciary for the rape allegations against Christine Blasey Ford.
I still don't know what he's gonna say.
No one knows for sure if Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the audience that he was not treated well because he wore a hat.
They threatened me on stage.
They said to me that I should not wear that hat.
They attacked me.
Then they say I'm in a lower position.
West said: "Do you want to see the lower position?" while saying that he would like to wear Superman's cape so that he couldn't be told what to do. "Do you want the world to advance?

Catalan: 
Try to love."
His comments provoked the heckling of the audience at least twice and the members of the production team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, which had a reporter on set who explained to the publication: "The entire studio was completely mute."
West was chosen as a replacement for Ariana Grande, who died last minute.
West left the audience stunned by his interpretation of the song I Love it, disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received the backing of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "A spirit of courage: THANKS BY DESTACING BETWEEN THE MULTITUD."
But the presenter of the debate show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was "being who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful."
But I have chosen not to reward someone (such as buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I believe is a threat to my community.
He is free.
We too.
Before the show, rapper Kanye West announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that now he was known as "the formerly known as Kanye West".
It is not the first artist to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, was previously known as Snoop Lion and the legendary musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and, subsequently, the artist known previously as Prince.
Accusation of murder in a restaurant in Belfast
A man of 45 years has been charged with murder in connection with an attempted murder on Friday in east Belfast.
According to the police, the incident has taken place in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear in court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, accuses a toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of the swordsman Jon Snow in the fantasy drama series "Game of Thrones."
This is not the first time that he has been accused of being a sex symbol.
In an interview with the Culture magazine of The Sunday Times, Kit said that he believed something had gone wrong and that he was questioning how to deal with the issue of male toxicity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted feeling a certain amount of determination to confront this problem.
“I personally ask me why we have been wrong in our masculinity.”
What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we experience now?
According to Kit, television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity through the characters in their shows.
What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young men feel that they have to have this virility?
I think it is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is certainly something has been done wrong with the boys.
He also admitted that he would not do any prequels or sequels of Joc de trons when the show is due to end in summer, saying that he is tired of battles and horses.
About November, Kit will star in a re-run of Sam Shepard’s True West, which tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
I know Rose is the best thing that has happened to me in the last 10 years.
I met my wife on the show, so I got my future family and life ahead of me.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow, the protagonist of the fantasy series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at the family estate in Scotland.
AIDS: China notifies a 14% increase in new HIV cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, compared to the past, when the majority of cases were due to accidents.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly in some regions of China due to transfusions of blood infected with HIV.
This is not true, however, as the number of people contracting HIV from this cause has been reduced almost to zero, according to the declarations of Chinese health officials in a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Any year after year, but the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000 people.
The HIV/AIDS epidemic in China is a serious problem for the LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Having in mind the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of homosexual men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the diseases transmitted are due to lack of precautions in sexual relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make anti-HIV medication available to all HIV-positive patients.
Maxine Waters denies that a staffer has leaked any confidential information to the media and dismisses “conspiracy theories” and “dangerous lies.”
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information of three US senators on the pages of the Wikipedia of the US senators.
The Democratic candidate in Los Angeles, Hillary Clinton, said that the protests were inspired by right-wing sites and blogs.
"Lies, lies and more lies, disgraceful lies, deplorable lies", he said on Twitter.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee, from Utah, and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was published by an unknown person in the Senate during a session of the Senate's Judiciary Committee on sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was related to Waters' office and that it revealed the personal information of a member of Waters' staff.
This false accusation is completely false and a pure lie.
The member of my personal staff, the personal data, security, and privacy of which has been compromised by these false and fraudulent allegations, is not responsible for this leak of confidential information.
This accusation is completely false and a pure invention.
The declaration by Waters was met with immediate criticism online, including that of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
This denial is full of indignation.
This makes it seem that he does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of a thing he has not done, he should not be angry.
Don't be too challenging.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He must maintain calm and serenity.
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Judge Kavanaugh session of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the House of Representatives, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Important if it's true", tweeted.
The office had warned the appropriate authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
We will ensure that criminals are revealed, prosecuted, and legally responsible for all actions that they have carried out and that they have harmed all and each of the members of my staff.
Johnny English Strikes Again: parody of spy movie starring Rowan Atkinson
It’s a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new British action-comedy film with a British perspective, and this re-release of the Johnny English franchise is no exception.
This satirical comedy on how we are so unworthy of being human will be a new opportunity for export of the country?
In any case, the incompetent of eyes sorted and cheeky face Johnny English has been able to renew his licence to twist everything. His name indicates more than any other thing that is a comic creation designed for territories of non-English speaking countries with a long history of going to the cinema.
He is the stupid agent secret who, despite his ridiculous pretensions of glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a bit of this guy who brings a note to the music of Carros de foc at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
The original traveler was the mysterious Atkinson, who represented the now-forgotten television commercials for Barclaycard, where he would go berserk everywhere he went.
There are two or three good moments in this last journey of JE.
I loved the Johnny English who dressed in a medieval armour and the blades of the helicopter's rotor hit his helmet.
S”hi sees Atkinson’s comedy skill for physical comedy, but the humour seems a bit too much and a bit too superfluous, especially because movie studios like 007 and Mission Impossible now include humour as a ingredient.
Humour seems to be aimed at children, and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as funny as Mr. Bean's gags.
The British Empire is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British spy network and revealed the identities of all the agents on the ground, which provokes the consternation of the agent of service, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a first minister who is a figure pretensious and beset by popular dissatisfaction, who is already suffering from a total collapse of political popularity: Emma Thompson delivers the best of herself as this calcated version of Theresa May, but the script does not quite reach more.
His intelligence advisers tell him that, as each spy is put at risk, he must recover some of the retired agents.
It includes the maldestrous Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but still teaching classes extra-officially on how to be an agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock ’n’ roll school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his patient sequaç Bough, who returns to play the role of Bough again.
Now Bough is a married man, tied up in the command of a submarine, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little underused.
So, the Batman and Robin of when things get very bad at the service secret of His Majesty's Government enter action again and find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular “femme fatale” Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the first minister is falling under the enchantment of the charming and charismatic billionaire who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their madness of bizarre antics: disguised as French chefs, they set fire to a French restaurant, make a contraband on board the yacht of Volta, and cause a great confusion by using a virtual reality headset to familiarise themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise that presents, it seems like a kids show.
Things that are not so normal.
I don’t think so.
The Labour Party denies that it is planning to introduce a four-day week.
The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical plan which would see British workers working four days a week and earning five.
The party wants to give employees a day off from work to celebrate the day when artificial intelligence (AI) overtook human intelligence (HUMAN).
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would receive the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the economic agenda of the party and the plans to shift the country in favor of workers.
The four-day week is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from the economic change.
A source familiar with the Labour Party said: “It is expected that a review of the policy will be announced before the end of the year.”
It is not a day job, but a week worker’s week is a fitting prospect in the perspective of the Labour Party of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and in the strategy of the Labour Party of industrialising the economy generally.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
This is not supported by the Labour Party currently.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: “A weekend of four days is not a party policy and the party is not considering it.”
The minister in the shadow John McDonnell used the weekend party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell made his determination to restore the power of the "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public utilities.
The plans of the shadow minister also include the shareholders of water companies could not recover all their investment, as the Labour government could apply deductions for crimes that it perceives.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on the boards of the firms and create shareholder funds to give 10% of the shares of the private firms to the employees, who expect to receive dividends annually for a value of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The FBI investigation of the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court at least a week, and has raised the question of whether some Republican senators might be influenced by the agency's discoveries to withdraw their support.
In an interview Sunday, the "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley will ask Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than her South Carolinian counterpart.
I'm seriously talking.
I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the scandal broke and the allegations were made public, and asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined and confident.
But Graham's vote seems to be burned in fire.
I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would present an explosive charge.
"Dra. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it rotundly.
Its name cannot be verified by anyone else.
He has 36 years.
I don't see any change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival? What is it for?
New York City will host this year’s Global Citizen Festival, a yearly music festival, that features a lineup of some of the world’s most famous artists, who perform to raise awareness and funds for the fight against poverty.
In the seventh edition of the Global Citizen Festival, hundreds of thousands of people will gather at the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances by artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awake the global consciousness of the goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international non-governmental organization that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to combat it actively.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless someone wants to pay for an VIP ticket), the attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a call, or any other activity to awaken consciousness about the goal of ending poverty.
What successes has achieved Global Citizen now that it is 12 years to the day it reached its target?
The idea of giving away free concerts is a good way to persuade people to demand action or just a case of "clicktivism" (people who think they can make a difference by signing a petition or tweeting a hashtag?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which it has used to achieve various goals.
The United Nations has committed to a total of 37,000 million USD in development assistance for the next 20 years.
Over the past few months, the group has made a number of commitments and announcements, of which at least 10,000 million USD have been raised as of August 2018.
The group estimates that the protected areas have had a direct impact on 649 million people around the world.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and producer committed to "helping children grow as much as possible" and pledging to send 35 million USD to help fight malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, governments and members of Global Citizens, we can turn the injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history", said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, in a live broadcast from London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions that asked the UK government to improve nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
Because we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult road. You may fall and fail.
But we will prevail, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at the event this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blocking" to obstruct Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior).
Washington can, "if necessary", call on the Navy to stop Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, and the markets of the East, including the Persian Gulf, according to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced Russia's intervention in Syria, primarily, where it operates with invitation from the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their will to negotiate with energy, like they do in Eastern Europe, the Southern European periphery.”
According to the official, there are ways and means to confront this issue.
The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to guarantee that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to blockade the seaways to prevent their energy from entering the market.
Zinke spoke to the attendees at Consumer Energy Alliance's annual conference, a nonprofit organization that claims to be the voice of consumers of energy in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategy for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are essentially the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, to replace and substitute fossil fuels.” While indicating that Russia only has one resource, which is the fossil fuels.
The declarations arrive while the administration Trump has been on a mission to promote the export of its natural gas liquid to Europe, in place of Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
With this end in mind, the officials of the US administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the project of the North Stream 2 "unsatisfactory" gas pipeline, which according to Trump, made Berlin "captive" to Moscow.
Moscow has consistently repeated that the North Stream 2 project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline, is purely economic.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is simply economic competition and is an example of trade competition.
I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be used as a tool to pressure and that consumers should have the power to choose their suppliers, said the minister of energy of Russia Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the secretary of energy of the United States Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The United States' stance has caused a negative response from Germany, which has reinforced its commitment to the project.
The main organization of the German industry, the FDI, has appealed to the US to withdraw its energy policy from the EU and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply.
Senator Warren will think deeply about her candidacy for the 2020 presidential election.
Senator Warren would consider seriously running for president after midterm election.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
It's time for women to take over the government, and fix the fracture in Washington.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider my candidacy for president.”
Warren intervened on the president Donald Trump during a municipal meeting and stated that "he was bringing the country in the wrong direction".
I am concerned about the threat to our democracy from Donald Trump.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said: "It's clear a FBI investigation is needed before the election".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed he should not run for president in 2020.
About half of Massachusetts' likely voters say the senator should not run, according to an Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
A thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed a wider support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with a 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and a 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democrats who were considered for the 2020 presidential nomination include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would announce his decision officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites the victim of posttraumatic stress disorder Track Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September 2007.
He was arrested and charged with assault and battery.
"With the troubled situation my own son has been through since he returned, I can understand other families that suffer from PTSD and some of the emotional scars that come with returning soldiers.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following about his son and other veterans of war: "They come back a little different, they return with a little bitter questioning of respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country.
The arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and he is charged with domestic violence toward a woman, with a charge for domestic violence and possession of a firearm under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, Wasilla Police Department spokesman.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge to a new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge to a new immigration policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or other forms of violent crime.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief in support of a refugee who challenged the immigration policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions case is the United States v. Sessions.
She said that her partner "and the children of the member of the violent band" assaulted her, but the American officials denied her asylum request on 20 July.
The arrested woman was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers arrive from the United States, as countries that face problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new immigration policy of the United States revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
The laws of the federal government require that asylum claims be adjudicated according to the facts and circumstances of the particular case, and this prohibition infringes this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The law also argued that the immigration policy that denies entry to immigrants hurts the economy, as it is more likely that immigrants will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs needed".
In June, the United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available for those who leave their country for persecution or fear of persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social or political group", Sessions said in an announcement on June 11, 2017.
The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems, nor even the most serious, that people face every day elsewhere in the world.
Thousands of rescue efforts are desperate to save lives as the death toll grows.
For survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"The environment is very tense", said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while calming her five-year-old son with fever in a relief centre in the devastated city of Palu.
Each minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There is no running water.
They have been seen returning to their homes destroyed by flooding to try to save whatever they can.
There are hundreds of injured, and hospitals are overwhelmed by the earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his right arm, are being treated outside the military hospital in Palu, as the patients are being treated outside because of the strong shaking that is happening.
The tears blinded his eyes as he described how the violent earthquake shook the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and his daughter.
There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think.
I heard my wife crying and I couldn't hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're all well."
The US Ambassador to China accuses China of "propaganda" attacks.
A week after a Chinese official publication in a U.S. newspaper promoted the advantages of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the press in the U.S. to disseminate propaganda.
The president Donald Trump addressed the Chinese Daily's payment supplement to the Des Moines Register, the state's most-sold daily newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the upcoming election.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections was a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and has seen increasingly high-profile trade tariffs.
The Chinese retaliatory tariffs on imports from Iowa and other states were aimed at punishing the exporters of those states, according to experts in China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, said Beijing had harmed American farmers, workers and businesses by imposing unfair trade practices.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion column in The Des Moines Register Sunday: "China is redoubling its harassment with propaganda ads in our free papers."
The Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press to disseminate its propaganda, using the free press to insert an ad in The Des Moines Register.
"On the contrary, at the street corner here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens may have on the troubling economic trajectory of China, because the media are dominated by the Communist Party of China."
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans are trying to squeeze in a candidate who can be seen as a moderate, but who is not a woman.
Because many of the main Republican support and defend Kavanaugh, who is facing multiple sexual assault allegations, the analysts say they will see a negative response from women, especially in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most of the Republican voters have already shown that they want to make a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be unraveled", said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said that Flake's last-minute efforts to calm voters angered him.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor tomorrow, nor in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, the principal and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn, Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
Friday morning, protesters shouted "november is coming!" (novembre s’acosta) while protesting in the Senate lobby while the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee continued to hold Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be left off the chart", said Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst.
The people say they are tall; it is true.
But they could have been more, especially among women in working-class and younger voters, who tend to vote less than older voters, who tend to vote more often than the younger ones.
Even before the public testimony of Ford, where he detailed his demands for sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that the Republicans could respond negatively if the Democrats pressed for confirmation.
This has become a mess for the GOP, said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee president, to NBC News.
"It's not just the vote of the board or the vote at the end, it's also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her. It's also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford's Star and those who believe in Kavanaugh's testimony, with the balance leaning slightly towards the last.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 per cent of those polled believe Ford's testimony to be "indubitably or probably true."
A further 38 per cent said they believed Kavanaugh had lied, while a further 30 per cent said the same of Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the demands made by Ford and, at least, of another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the influence of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramírez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals in a party while they studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that is competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the open-source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
The platform Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who can access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention of Inrupt was "to dominate the world".
"We must do it now", said the startup.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses the Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own personal data warehouse or a Personal Online Data Store (POD).
It can contain contacts, tasks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is like the Google Drive, the Microsoft Outlook, the Slack and the Spotify. They are all available in a browser at once.
The unique thing about the online store is that the user is who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills so that Solid is available to everyone.
The company is currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some employees hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
A week from now, developers around the world can create their own decentralized technology applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that nobody from his team is talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change to their business models during the night.
We're not asking permission.
Inrupt is a mission to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for helping protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.
The World Wide Web Consortium was founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The last months, Berners-Lee has been a voice in the debate over the net's neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the new era of the web".
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years after the event.
The Reverend Bernard Vann received the Victoria Cross for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
It was not until four days later that he learned he had won the British military's most prestigious award.
His two grandsons unveiled a commemorative plaque in a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone was exactly 100 years after the achievement of his great-grandfather's.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the lieutenant colonel Vann led his battalion through a foggy and stiffening "cloud" and under the "constant and accurate" fire of "cannons and machine-guns".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the most courageous bravery, advanced the line before launching himself on a cannon with a single hand and leaving astonished three members of the detachment.
The lieutenant colonel was shot by a sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that the deeds of his grandfather’s were a feat that you never could match, which produces a sense of humility.
They and their brother, the dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was very honour to be part of the parade and added that the true value of a hero is the support he will receive from a lot of people.
The fans of MMA who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, slept in place of the Pig
Imagine you stay awake all night to see Bellator 206 and that you are denied seeing the most important event.
The San Jose fight card contained 13 fights, including six of the main card and had to be shown live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the audience in the UK was stunned when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were displeased to have been awake all night to see the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change as "a disgusting joke".
The government's rules say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to children's programming.
"Peppa the Pig, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
I think repetition works.
But there are six in the morning in your time zone, and we can’t solve it until Monday morning, Monday at our time.
But we're working on it.
I believe you, when I changed channels, there were many messages that went and came, and not all were pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not a problem of the government.
I promise you that this won't happen again.
We'll just leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We'll try to show it to the fans, but it wasn't possible.
It is a sad situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” on sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have felt inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The athlete of 24 years has said he didn't realize until he went to high school that there wasn't everyone like him.
On the Desert Island Discs programme of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke of the rights of gays to give “hope” to others.
He also said that being a father had rested importance on winning the Olympics.
The presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, has taken a short break from the show.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on the first show of Laverne, said he felt "less than" the other kids because "it wasn't acceptable socially for boys and girls to be".
He said the following: "I have said the following: "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been things that I have truly experienced and given me the power and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", so he did not disappoint anyone when his sexuality was revealed.
The two times Olympic medalist has become a high-profile advocate for the LGBT movement and has used his image at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to live openly without branches and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion has been in a relationship with Dustin Lance Black, the American film director, who he met in 2013, "I was surprised".
Later, Daley married a man 20 years her senior, but says age is not a problem.
He was the first member of the British Royal Family to experience such highs and lows.
The couple were parents to a boy in June who was given the name Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "all of his perspective has changed."
If you had asked me a year ago, I would have said, "I'd like to win an Olympic gold medal."
There are things more important than the Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is the Robbie.
His son is called Robert, like his father, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, from a brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had already got the London 2012 tickets because he wanted to be in the front row, right next to the stage.
He could not say “Dad, you won’t be in the front row”.
While holding her hand, he stopped breathing and it was only then that I finally accepted that he was not invincible.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was the dream I had been dreaming of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in the Olympics. No feeling better."
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Proud), which he had heard during the preparation for the Olympics and that still made him shiver.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 programme that features a celebrity guest who is invited to a studio audience.
Unexpected Mickelson showed up at the Ryder Cup.
The American Phil Mickelson will play his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical condition if he wants to avoid a sad ending.
Mickelson, who will be participating in the biennial event for the 12th time, was presented by captain Jim Furyk for the “fourballs” and “fouromes” matches on Saturday.
In place of being in the centre of the action, as has been typically for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments has been known to spend his time as an animator and working on his game on the course, hoping to correct the things that hurt him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, nor has he been the most consistent, but the player is not the ideal choice for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough tends to punish drivers with a lot of spin.
If his own career is not enough to discourage him, Mickelson will be facing the precise champion of the Open Britànic, Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games of this week.
If the Americans start strong, the match could be a close affair.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say anything more.
"He understood perfectly his role for that day, he grabbed my back and surrounded me with his arm while he said he would be ready the next day", said Furyk.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a Hall of Fame and has made a lot of contributions to these teams previously and this week.
Probably, I didn't imagine him playing two matches.
I imagined more, but that’s how he trained and that’s how we believed we had to advance.
He wants to be there, like any other.
Mickelson will surpass Faldo's record of most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can also mean the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that hasn't matched his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk has said that his presence has added intangibles to the team.
He is funny, sarcastic, joking, and a good team player.
I think the younger players also enjoyed teasing him this week, which was fun to see.
He brings a lot of value to the game.
The captain of the European Cup Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can be lost quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that starting with a significant advantage in the final singles matches of the Ryder Cup can quickly become a tough day.
The Danish debuted in 1997 at Valderrama, when the Seve Ballesteros-captained European team had a five-point lead over the American team, but at the end they won by a narrow margin, 14.5-13.5.
“We still remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we lost there, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by a little,” said Bjorn, after seeing the victory of the team of 2018 by 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which leaves the score at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The history has taught me and all the members of the team that still hasn't finished.
Tomorrow you must be running like a speeding bullet.
You have to get out and do it right.
It does not stop until the points score.
We have a goal, we have to win the trophy, and we must keep our concentration to achieve it.
I am focusing on the 12 players I have in my team, but I also have in mind who our opponents are: the best players in the world.
Enjoyed the performance of his players on a challenging course, Bjorn said.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performance will be the difference and it changes everything.
It is fantastic to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but the one-on-one matches put to the test your maximum capacity to play golf.
This is the message you have to send to your players, to show your best to them.
In this moment, you leave your partner and he must now show his best.
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to play better individually than in teams, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who each contributed three points of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin on the last day of play, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before losing in the “Miracle of Medinah” that Europe won.
“I remember exactly all the words”, has answered the question on how he motivated Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, before the last day.
We have 12 important games to play, but we want to start with a good start, like we did in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, pressure is placed on the central defenders.
We have prepared the lineup in accordance with circumstances and in accordance with the best way to try to make magic tomorrow.
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the comeback against Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of Europeans in the first half of the order.
I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities.
The new warship of Germany, delayed again.
The new German Navy frigate would have to have been completed by 2014 to replace the old ships of the German Navy from the time of the Cold War, but it is not expected to be ready until at least the year that comes, due to problems with the ship's systems and a cost increase, according to local media.
The completion of the “Rheinland-Pfalz” class frigates has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a spokesman for the German Navy.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems with the construction of the ship have delayed the project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-shipping technology, as well as counter-action to actions such as stealth, infrared signatures, and acoustic signature.
Other notable features include longer maintenance periods: it should be possible to use the new frigates for two years without visiting a port.
However, these delays mean that these ships will be obsolete when they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 ship was the subject of international headlines last year, when the German Navy refused to accept the ship and returned it to the shipyard.
It was the first time that the Royal Navy returned a ship to the builder after it had been delivered.
The ship has been returned to the German Navy for repairs, but the details of the reasons for its return have not been made public.
The technical problems are important, as there are approximately 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the former Bremen class ships, operating in the new Baden-Württemberg ships.
The ship is also too heavy, which limits its performance and reduces the capacity of the Royal Navy to add new features to the ship.
It is believed that the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, of 7,000 tons, will be twice as heavy as ships of similar size used by the Germans during World War II.
The project is beginning to become a financial burden on the company.
It is believed that he has reached a net worth of somewhere between €3.1 billion and €3.2 billion (3.600 million to 3.700 million USD).
The problems of the new frigates have become a special issue, if you consider the recent reports that indicate that the German navy is weakening its naval power.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, has recognized that the German Navy “is running out of ships that can be used”.
The official has stated that the situation has worsened over time because the ships were left to deteriorate, but no new ships were provided as a replacement.
He lamented that none of the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Spy Insect Fund spies on the secret lives of bats
A new study is being carried out in a Scottish farm to discover how bat species use the landscape to forage.
The discovery of the species is expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of these unique mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The Scottish National Foundation for Science's study of the ratpenats soprano and common, as well as the orellut northern and water bat, will be followed up by scientists at the Wester Ross National Botanic Garden.
The bat boxes will be placed in key locations on the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
Volunteers and NHS staff will also be deployed to carry out mobile surveillance with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds in the recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the sounds of the bats and what they do.
With this information, a report and map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed image of the animal's behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a Scottish conservation naturalist, expects the results to show which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they use them each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as creating grasslands, and how to improve maintenance of forests for bat species and other species associated with them.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Building and restoration work threatens bats, as it affects their nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also present a risk, as does the paper matamosques and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
They are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal habits of hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey item.
They use a sophisticated technique of echo location to locate insects and obstacles that block their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens important historic landmarks and 76,000 acres of important land in Scotland, takes bat-related matters very seriously.
They have ten experts with the appropriate training, who carry out regular surveys, inspections of nests, and, occasionally, rescues of baby birds.
Even, the organization has created the first and only Scotland-based reserve dedicated to bats at the Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The landlord, David Thompson, says the area is ideal for the species.
Here, in Threave, we have a large area for bats.
We have old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.
But we still don't know many things about bats, so we're still learning more about them here and at other properties.
Remember to check whether there are bats before doing maintenance on properties, as it may be that accidental destruction of a maternity nest may kill 400 females and young, which could potentially lead to the disappearance of a whole population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, molest them, and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish conservationist, encourages people to step up and help.
He has said the following: “We have yet to learn much from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data on their population”.
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against a German tabloid
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the allegations of rape against him are “false news” and has stated that people “want to be famous” because of his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus player has been accused of raping a woman in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was alleged to have paid 375,000 $ to keep the incident secret, as reported by Der Spiegel magazine.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, who has 142 million followers, said the allegations were “fake news”.
No, no, no, no, no.
The news today, fake news.
They want to be famous through my name.
It is normal.
They want to profit from my name, but it is part of my job.
I am happy and everything is in order.”
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the publication of "information that is inadmissible of suspicion of private life", according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek damages for “moral damage” for a level of seriousness that is “probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Casino Resort and Hotel in Las Vegas.
After a night of partying, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to Ronaldo's room, where, according to the court records, he raped the player anally.
Mayorga asserts that Ronaldo said he was a “99% good guy, except for a 1% bad boy”.
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that both women consented to sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and had them take pictures of the injuries at the hospital, but later accepted a settlement outside of court because he was “fearful of the repercussions” and “feared being humiliated publicly”.
The woman, 34, says she wants to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged incident took place.
Brexit: The UK would “never regret” losing car makers.
The UK would regret ever losing its world leadership in manufacturing if it left the EU, according to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
It is “preoccuping” that the base of Toyota in the UK has said to the BBC that, if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal, it would stop temporarily production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
We need a deal.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of border delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The plant in Burnaston, which makes the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production at our plant will stop.
The UK's exit from the EU without a trade deal on how the country will function with the rest of the EU has stirred up fears of other carmakers in the UK.
For example, BMW claims that it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to the risks in the production chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
The production line of Toyota is run on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there is a possibility of rioting at the border, which the sector considers could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would be halted as a result.
Clark asserts that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls".
“We must reach an agreement. We want the best deal that will allow us to enjoy the success we have today, and also to take full advantage of this opportunity.”
“The tests of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicate that we need to continue with a successful production line”.
Toyota has not been able to confirm when production would stop, but, at long-term, it has warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union at the plant, has stated that the workers are concerned about the situation: “When jobs are lost, they never return”.
A spokesman for the government has said the following: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU”.
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed.
The expected meeting between President Trump and Attorney General Rosenstein is likely to be delayed a week while the fight over Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House officials said Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the 2016 election, the links between Russia and Trump's campaign, and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump.
If Trump fires or not the Attorney General Adjunct and jeopardizes Mueller's independence, the rumors have been going on for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of a microphone being used to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing him with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But Monday last week, he went to the White House between rumors that he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was in New York at the United Nations.
Trump has stated that he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a confrontation with the audience of the Senate Judiciary Committee which heard testimony from Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Friday, Trump ordered an investigation of a week by the FBI on the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote of all the Senate.
The press secretary for President Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday's Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “I don’t know, it could be this week, but it could be a week later. It could be delayed a week because of all the court cases.
But I will see you later.
Some journalists might refute this assertion: Sanders has not held a news conference at the White House since September 10.
Why does he wear a tiara?
Sanders answered that the lack of news-reporting sessions was not because he liked the fanfarronery of television journalists, though he said: “I don’t deny that they are fanfarrons”.
Then he suggested that Trump would be more open to the media.
“The president makes more question and answer sessions than any previous president”, said, before adding the following without citing any source: “We have consulted these figures”.
Sanders has stated that the press conferences will continue, but if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, it is much better to talk directly to him.
We try to do it often, we've seen you do it a lot in the last few weeks and they will replace the news briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public or press conferences with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal and strange appearance, and in some moments, strange behaviour.
The Secretary of Health writes to workers in the EU health service about fears of a Brexit.
The Secretary of health has written to the staff of the Scottish National Health Service to express gratitude for their service and wishes that they continue after Brexit.
Jane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter to less than six months of the UK's departure from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of the applications for EU citizenship for those working in the public services that are delegated to the Scottish Government.
During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on Brexit have continued, and it seems that they are on track to reach the desired decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in case of a no-deal Brexit.
I know that times are turbulent for you all.
I appreciate the contribution of all the members of staff, regardless of their nationality.
The partners in the European Union, and beyond, provide valuable expertise and skills that strengthen and improve the healthcare delivery, while benefiting patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christopher Abercrombie undergoes emergency brain surgery after suffering a head injury.
Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee State Tigers sideline linebacker, has been subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in the loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ, of the Tennessean.
The coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, has told the press that the injury occurred in the first half.
“He came to the edge of the line and fell there.”
The trainers and the medical staff gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher and carrying him off for further tests.
A Tennessee State officer has reported that Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, had reported that Abercrombie had left the hospital after surgery.
Harris has added that “no information has yet been given on the type or extent of the injury” and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, of second year, with Tennessee State after signing him from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles before leaving the game, which is a total of 18 this season.
The foreign buyers of British property will have to pay a higher stamp duty on their property purchases in the UK.
The foreign buyers of property in the UK will have to pay a higher stamp duty on their money to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralise the success of Corbyn's appeal to young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Tax authorities expect to earn up to £120 million a year from the homeless.
The government is expecting foreigners to pay a higher tax on buying property in the UK and the money will be used to help homeless people.
This action is seen as a way to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters by making promises of affordable housing that would affect the highest-earning families.
The increase in the stamp duty tax will be levied on those who do not pay UK taxes; this money will be used to combat the number of people without a home in the UK.
The surcharge, which will be added to the stamp duty, will be up to 3%.
The government expects to earn up to £120m a year from the sale of the stake in the company.
The 13% of new build properties in London are occupied by non-British residents, which increases the cost of buying a home and makes it difficult for new buyers to get past the first floor.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside of the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has asked a reduction in the stamp duty on first homes for young people to help them get their first home.
He accused the biggest builders of maintaining high prices for properties by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the land tax on affordable homes to correct the “disastrous” property market in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive reforms, including a series of proposals to control rental prices and eviction procedures.
It also gives the local authorities more power to build new homes.
May has stated the following: “Years ago I said I would dedicate my first year in office to restoring the British dream: life must improve for each new generation.
It means to correct the broken housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it is not right that it is the same easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for companies with their headquarters outside the United Kingdom, to buy a home in comparison with British workers who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the shame of people without a home is too much.
My greatest ambition is to train Scotland.
The Sunderland manager, Jack Ross, has stated his “greatest ambition” is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish, 42, has accepted the challenge of reviving the club he played for in the north-east, which is now in third place in the League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning the St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called up once as a support and that’s all.
But I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it always brings me back to the time when I was a kid.
This opportunity only comes to me if I have success training clubs, but”.
His predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager claims he does not feel pressure to be the next in a list of names consecrated in a bigger club, after having rejected previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“So far, my success measure is whether I can get this team back to the Premier League.
With the club's structures and facilities, it is clear that the club's place is the Premier League.
It is not easy to reach the top, but only consider success if I can make it back here if I can make it back here again.
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He helped the Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier and helped the St Mirren win the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“Probably it was a turning point in my life.”
I had always believed that training was the best thing I did, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I did it reasonably well, and I had a few good moments.
But playing can be very tough.
There are many things you have to overcome every week.
I still feel like I'm doing a good job, but I'm feeling good as an assistant coach.
I have always wanted to train and now I am training, it is the first time I have been so comfortable since I was a kid.

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The heatwave has sparked a surge in demand for beer in pubs in troubled areas of Britain, but has added more pressure on the chains of fast food restaurants.
The bars and bars have a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but the restaurants have a 4.8% decline.
Peter Martin, from the financial services CGA, which has collected the data, says: “The continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World Cup, which has been extended more than expected, has made the July like the June, with a 2.8% increase in bars, except for restaurants, which have suffered badly.
The reduction of 1.8% in restaurant consumption in June has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of alcohol, have achieved the best results, while the consumption of food has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, but it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
They seem to have only wanted to drink and party.
In pubs and taverns that we have visited, sales of drinks have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, the analyst of leisure and hospitality RSM, has said the following: “These results continue the trend we saw from the end of April.
The time and impact of large social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related with the sales of the external market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decline of 4.8% in annual sales would be particularly damaging, more than the continuing pressure on costs.
This long and hot summer and the time of the year when most shops serving food is at its worst.
The total sales of bars and restaurants, including newly opened, has increased by 2.7% in July, indicating a slight alenting in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK restaurant, bar and tavern sector collects and analyses data from 47 operators, with a loss of more than £9 million and is the industry's leading source of performance data.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that hide from parents.
One in five children, some of 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students indicated a rise in the number of fake Instagram pages.
The news have made the fears of sexual content grow.
The 20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show parents.
One in five children, some of 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide from parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students indicated a rapid rise in the number of “fake” Instagram accounts.
The news have made the fears of sexual content growing fears.
About 20% of students say they have a “main” account that they show to parents, while also having a private account.
A mother who discovered her daughter's secret account saw a message from her daughter asking her to “rape me”.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC directors' committee of private schools, has revealed that 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, of which half have admitted to having a private account.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, has said: “It is disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them”.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voices of athletes” in the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation annual general meeting.
Doyle is the athlete with the most medals in Scotland and the president Ian Beattie described the opportunity as a great one for those guiding the sport to benefit from his international experience over the last decade.
“Eliud Kipchoge has the respect of the Scottish athletics community, the UK and the world and we are confident that the Scottish athletics community will benefit from his inclusion on the board of directors.”
Doyle has stated the following: “I have many ambitions to act as the voice of athletes and I hope to grow the sport and contribute to it in Scotland.”
The American, who won the silver medal in the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, has four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC.
He suffered a stroke last month.
He could not walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I can recover or to what extent.
It was a tiring job, but I have recovered and I am back to full health, I have returned to full health!
Thanks for the messages of support!
A milk advertisement that compares mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet.
A breast milk extraction machine company has divided opinion on the Internet with a TV commercial that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows.
To mark the launch of the first “silent breast pump that can be worn in the world”, the consumer technology company Elvie has released a parody music video to show the freedom that breast pumps give to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows in a song that includes lyrics like: “Yes, I'm milking myself, but not a tail” and “If you hadn't noticed, they're not braguers, but my breasts.”
The return continues: “Pump, pump, food, pump, pump, babies, pump, babies”.
However, the announcement, published on the Facebook page of the company, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reaction from those who have seen it, with many claiming the video shows the horrors of dairy farming.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.”
Like us, they must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies soon after birth.
The breast pump Elvie is discreetly hidden in a lactation vest (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented the following: “Traumatically difficult for the mother and baby.”
But why not use them to announce a breast pump for mothers who will keep their babies?
Another user added: “Is this a place to put an ad like that?”
Other people defended the advertisement; a woman admitted that she found the song “funny”.
I think it is a great idea.
I'd buy one if I had to breastfeed him.
Bombing for the breast pump made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit of a madness, but it's a good one.
It is a great product.
Another person commented the following: "This is a funny ad for mothers who pump with breast pumps (usually in their place of work or in the bathroom and feel like cows)."

Catalan: 
It is not a commercial endorsement of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the breast pump in the back.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women feel like cows when using a breast pump.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding support, which gives more freedom to women to move, hold on to their babies and even breastfeed while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a founder and developer of Mother, said the following: “The Elvie Sling is a revolutionary breastfeeding product that deserves a bold and provocative campaign.
In drawing the parallel between cows and women, we wanted to show the public how a breast pump works, and the challenges it brings, while also demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom it brings.
It is not the first time that Elvie has been in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two kids appeared on the runway for the designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Centenars of illegal immigrants, transported quietly into a tent camp on the border of Texas.
The number of illegal children crossing the border has increased, but the monthly entries through the border has remained stable, in part because the tough rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most foster parents were undocumented immigrants who have had fears of losing their immigration papers if they took in a child.
The risk has increased in June, when the federal government announced that potential foster parents and the rest of adults who live in their homes would have to send digital fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
The week before, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied to host children who had come to the U.S. without their parents.
The agency confirmed later that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
“The vast majority of people who have hosted or live in the home of a person who has hosted are illegal immigrants, and a large majority of them are foreign criminals.”
We will continue to pursue these people.”
To process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court in one month after being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the standard previously.
Many of them will appear remotely, rather than in person, to defend their case before a immigration judge.
All those who are not deemed fit for help, will be deported immediately.
As children spend more time in custody, the more likely it is that they will develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, according to reports given by the system in the past months.
Lawyers say that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of its size, the signs that a child is suffering will be overlooked.
They have added that moving children from the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many of them already suffer.
Syria calls on the occupation forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Heading to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Walid al-Muallem, asked refugees from Syria to return home, despite the war in the country being eight years old.
Muallem, who also acts as the country's vice-prime minister, has stated that the foreign forces in Syria are illegal under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “the matter will be dealt with consequently”.
“Should be withdrawn immediately and without conditions.”
Muallem has stressed that the “terror war in Syria is practically over,” where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of refugees.
He has stated that Syria would continue to fight this holy battle until we have cleared all of Syria of both terrorist groups and any foreign presence that is illegal.
The United States have about 2000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise the Kurdish and Arab forces that are fighting against Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops on the ground of a country that is ravaged by war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has declared that the conditions were good for their return and has blamed “some western countries” for stirring up “irrational fears” that make refugees want to stay away.
We have requested from the international community and humanitarian organizations that they facilitate these returns.
“They are politically capitalizing on a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no foreign aid for reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in Idlib has given the chance for continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a major escalation of the Syrian war, with the help of Russia's support, three million people live in the province, where there is a civil war.
However, Muallem has emphasized that the agreement has clear “terms” and has expressed hope that the military action will make front to the jihadists, which include fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will be “eradicated”.
Staffan de Mistura, UN envoy, expects to soon call for the formation of a new committee of members of the government and the opposition to begin drafting a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem said the Syrian government should be allowed to participate in the committee, the task of which would be to review the current constitution.
Why Trump will win again
According to this logic, Trump would likely win the 2020 election unless many expected scandals and impeachment proceedings end his presidency early.

Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged can afford.
I yet, being a citizen informed is going beyond when you find yourself at the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts debate the use that Bob Woodward has made of “private sources” for his book “Fear”, the fur coat of 15,000 dollars of Paul Manafort (“a thick coat of fur”, as the Washington Post called it), and the horrific descriptions of, say, Stormy Daniels of, say, the anatomy of Trump.

The money from the outside is pouring into the races for the House of Representatives' mid-term elections.
It's no surprise that money is pouring into the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has made two members of the current congressional delegation to have to compete for the same seat.
This recent reassignment of the Pittsburg suburb district, which includes the representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces a rival, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the 12th Pennsylvania district, which is currently in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has unleashed a financial war between the top two financing organizations of both parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was a name to be heard in Pennsylvania after a close election in a special election in March to represent the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The Republicans have held the seat for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won by 20 points.
The experts give Democrats a slight edge.
The United States impose sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but they withdraw them.
The diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump had a tense meeting with Panamanian president Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until his team was ousted by his partners.
Officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for the “recent decisions on Taiwan”
However, only El Salvador was punished, which received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, according to estimates, for drug control, development and economic improvement.
The sanctions proposed, which include cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be harmful to the country and the high numbers of murders and unemployment.
With the passage of the meetings, officials of both countries posponed a high-level security and economic prosperity meeting to continue with a similar one held the year before and viewed as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But officials of high rank in the administration wanted the meeting to take place, which effectively ended any chance of a punishment for Salvador.
The vice president Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration gives to the issue.
The three American ambassadors returned to the United States discreetly.
A spokesman for the White House denied talking about the details of the debate, which included two diplomats, who agreed to debate the deliberations internally from the anonymity.
A neutral external analyst, close to the administration and also from within the administration, corroborated the statements.
He studied history.
The next event to occur could be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which is a large number of public records.
The Mueller investigation also investigates whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the 2016 election.
If the House of Representatives changes hands, Trump could be found to be answerable to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, just as he is preparing to do before the voters, and, even more importantly, before a jury of his own party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or of any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions that need to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
The year 1938, German officers were willing to make a coup against Hitler, only if the western bloc had resisted and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We failed and we lost the chance to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuations over points of inflexion like this and accelerates or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is facing several important points of inflexion currently.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the Attorney General's Adjunct, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water at the neck since this newspaper reported that, in the year before, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not suitable for the office.
Rosenstein asserts that the Times' information is not precise.
“What will we do if the new investigation requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if the Supreme Court confirms everything for Brett Kavanaugh even though the allegations of abuse and false testimony are credible?”
I, especially, will we vote in the mid-term to elect a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be in danger.
But I think we'll succeed, because I learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish woman deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the house of the Czech ambassador.
He survived, he migrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me a note in Hebrew to light Shabbat candles on that table with the Nazi symbol.
With this background, how can I not be optimistic about the future?
Norman Eisen, a long-time Brookings Institution researcher, is the president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of “The Last Palace: Europe’s Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House”.
Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers know that a win against the Rapid in Austria would put them in a good position to qualify for the group stage of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season until the 1-1 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
It was a positive point for us, because the Vila-real is a good team.
We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we left with a draw.
Maybe we could have got something more out of it, but, in general, probably the draw was a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope to get three points, but it will be a tough game because they have a good result last week, but I'm sure we'll do our best and achieve a good result with the support of the fans.
The year last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the club changes, but now it is a good place to be.
The team is good and the training is good.
I hope we can do everything, to have a great season and have success.
Women lose sleep over fears of savings for retirement.
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how to be cared for, few talked to family about it.
Approximately half of those polled at national level say they have spoken to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of those polled said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to have someone to care for, but they don't dare to ask it outright", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide.
The first step is to begin with.
Talk to your partner and your kids: you can't prepare your family to look after you if you don't communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
He can help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your options for long-term care financing may include a traditional insurance policy, a life insurance policy, or a hybrid long-term value insurance policy that helps cover the costs or a personal insurance policy that you fund with your own resources, if you have the money to do so.
Prepara your legal documents: cut the fight against legal battles.
Look for a representative to designate a trusted person to oversee your health care and ensure that healthcare professionals are aware of your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary public to handle your financial affairs.
It is important to select a trusted person to take financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your aged relative has an emergency medical issue and is on his way to the hospital.
You could answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be ready.
Finance is not the only factor that needs to be considered, but also with whom to treat the patient.
What are the medicines?
Who will look after the dog?
Be prepared.

Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in the province of West Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Friday.
Because communications are cut, the rescue units have not yet been able to obtain information from the regency of Donggala, a region in the north of Palu more proximate to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Palu and Donggala are two islands in the province of West Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Palu is the capital of the Central Cèlebes Province, located at the narrowest point of a bay in the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coast in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The regency, a region administratively inferior to a province, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the province's economy.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several earthquakes in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
The 1938 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami was a major natural disaster that killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala, Sumatra, Indonesia.
The 1996 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami was a major natural disaster that struck the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia on 26 December.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and earthquakes are common.
The following earthquakes and earthquakes have been the most powerful in recorded history:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake in the western part of the province of Ace, Indonesia, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people at the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in March and April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, in the west of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the south of Java, the island with the most populated in Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that killed almost 700 people.
2009: A major earthquake of 7.6 on the Richter scale struck a region near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
They died more than 1,100 people.
2010: A major earthquake of 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a massive tsunami that killed hundreds of people and destroyed many villages.
2016: A minor earthquake hit the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the buildings that collapsed.
2018: A series of large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, primarily in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
The eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested with charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, has been arrested with charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspected domestic violence offender, interfering with an ongoing domestic violence report, and resisting arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known tried to call the police to report a crime, he pulled the phone away from her.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su detention facility, where he is held with a $500 USD bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when he was asked if he was "satisfied" when
Palin faces three A-school misdemeanors, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and be required to pay a $250,000 fine.
He also was accused of a Class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with a day in jail and $2,000 USD in fines.
This is not the first time that charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report a suspected attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the veterans court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference with an investigation of a domestic violence incident and possession of a firearm in a drunken state.
His partner said he had been punched in the face.
The year 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for associating the violent behavior of her son to a posttraumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after a powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase over the next days.
The earthquake has occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, near the capital Jakarta.
On the other hand, the video of the crash has been widely circulated on social media.
Centenars of people had gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Fiscal's request for a death penalty for suspected terrorist
The New York State Attorney General's Office requests the death penalty for the suspect in the #NYC #terrorist attack.
The suspect, a 30-year-old man, used a Home Depot truck to commit a terror attack on a bicycle lane in the West Side Highway, in lower Manhattan, and killed at least one person and injured at least 20 others.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the district attorney's notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
The two crimes could be punishable by death, according to the document.
The grand jury accused Saipov of eight murder charges, including murder in the first degree, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
The prosecution said the attack required a "planning and premeditated act of violence" and described the attack as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the intention.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last time the South Bronx had a capital crime trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison.
The last time a federal death penalty was carried out in New York was in 1953 for the Rosenbergs, a married couple executed after being convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union two years before.
Their deaths were both by electrocution on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbekistani, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police said he told them he was feeling fine because he had done something good.
Due to the written accusation, Saipov explained to authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of the Islamic State on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked that the flag of ISIS be displayed in his room at the hospital.
He has been acquitted of 22 counts of sexual assault.
David Patton, one of the public defenders who represented Saipov, said he was "deeply disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
We consider that the decision to ask for the death penalty, rather than accept a guilty plea and a life sentence without possibility of parole for all those involved, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved.
The defense team of Saipov had previously asked the prosecutors to not seek the death penalty.
Member of the Conservative Party claims Nigel Farage should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to mobilise the people's troops today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the UKIP has stated that politicians should "feel the pressure of the euro-sceptics" when one of their own members of parliament has suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone said to the march in Birmingham that the UK would be out of the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing the lady May as she tries to conciliate the deeply divided ranks of the Conservative Party has been highlighted when the pro-Union Conservatives have marched in a separate protest in the City.
The first minister is fighting to keep her plan for Brexit compromise between attacks from the pro-Remain, pro-Union and pro-EU supporters.
Allies insist that she will reach a deal with Brussels despite the negative answers and pressures the eurosceptics and the Conservative Party to choose between her and chaos.
The man said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to undo the commitment at Chequers.
He suggested that the lord Farage should have been appointed to the House of Lords and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would be out.
The member of parliament Wellingborough added: "I will defend the Brexit, but I will defy Chequers".
To precisely oppose the EU, he said: "We fought wars of conquest to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
The Lord Bone rejected the suggestion that the British public had changed its mind since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British population has changed its mind and wants to stay is totally false".
The Conservative Party supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said to the reporters: "Only I tell you, PM, listen to the people".
"The Chequers Compromise is impopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is impopular with our party and our activists, who are the people who get us out to the street and make us win elections.
Abandon the Chequers deal and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, he said: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
The Farage said politicians at the rally must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
This is a question of trust between us (the people) and our classical political class.
They are trying to betray the Brexit and today we are here to say to them that we will not allow it.
In a message to the crowd, he said: "I want the crowd to make the politicians feel the pressure".
We are mobilising the people's popular army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the supporters of union held a rally in Birmingham before celebrating a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists held banners over the Conservative Party's headquarters after the launch of the group this weekend.
The Conservative peer Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservative Party's security problems at the start of the conference.
These are the people who say they can have the IT systems and all the technology needed to sign Canada plus plus, to border free trade, to free trade without friction, to free trade in Ireland.
It is a complete hoax.
There is no option for a good Brexit.
Warren intends to examine the possibility of running for president.
Senator Warren says she will examine the possibility of running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton spoke about her future in a public meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection to her seat in November against the GOP candidate Geoff Diehl, who was the state's campaign manager for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.
He has been the subject of speculation about the possibility of him being replaced by his son in 2020.
The event of Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the open format of constituent meetings that Trump has held since he assumed office.
He was asked if he would be a candidate for the presidency.
Warren answered that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the top of the government.
A person arrested for the murder of Sims, of LSU
The police of Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect for the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The department of police in Baton Rouge has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at the ET news conference at 11:00.
They published a video of the shooting Friday and asked for help identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus in the early morning of Friday.
"Wayde Sims received a shot in the head, which, eventually, killed him", said Murphy J. Paul, a police officer, to the media on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to police station in East Baton.
Simms, a junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 parts with 10 starts during the last season and had a 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the World Championship after team orders handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas crossed the line ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' orders would play a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and nearly overtook Hamilton while defending his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits before and let Hamilton run through the traffic in the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at the pits and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton was able to overtake him after a certain action that caused the Ferrari driver to lose the inside corner with the risk of being left outside after a double movement to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started last on the grid and at the end of the first lap he was in seventh position.
Then he continued to maintain his position for the remainder of the race, saving his tires to finish fourth.
Finally, he entered the pits at the 44th lap, but could not increase his pace at the eight following races and Räikkönen finished fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job during the weekend and he was a real gentleman who said no to me when I asked him to let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job by having a two-one.
His body language was terrible.
The President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for laughing at the Presidential candidate's claim that Senator Dianne Feinstein did not leak the Christine Blasey Ford letter.
In a campaign rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony of Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but rather commented that the Senate was "evil, cruel, and liars".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening right now in the Senate, when you see angry, bad, cruel and liar people, when you see people being bad, cruel and liar."
When you see the communiqués and leaked information and say "I haven't been me.
I have not been me".
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
You remember his reply... Did you filter the document? "Eh, what?
No, no.
I didn't filter it.
Hello, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn't filter it.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and was told of the leak in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
I did not hide her statements, I did not censor her story, I did not hide her history
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential, as he asked me to do."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented on the President's nightly news broadcast: "What's the point of it? His body language was terrible."
Maybe he didn't do it, but he was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, suggesting that Democrats were using the comments with their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see evil, cruelty, no matter who they hurt, they don't care who they have to hurt to get power and control.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat of Friday against the Belfast Giants, as they won the return game 5 to 3 in Dundee.
The Giants took a two-goal lead through the goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie rose the level of their team, but, after Dwyer restored the lead, Dwyer restored the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied the Dundee. After two goals by Lundvald Nielsen, the victory was secured.
It was the third defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had previously beaten Dundee 2 1-0 in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the three previous games.
The first goal came from Dwyer at 4:35, with a pass from Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with an assist from David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this agitated initial period, Sullivan returned the team to the game at the 13:10 mark before Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at the 15:16 mark.
Dwyer secured the advantage for the Giants in the first break when he scored the second goal in the first period.
The local team re-grouped and Bouchard again contributed to his level with a powerful goal at the 27:37 mark.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the second half and secured the victory for their team with the fifth goal in the dying minutes of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, are at home, in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
A controller dies saving hundreds of passengers from a quake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after dying to ensure that an aircraft landed safely.
Over 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a massive tsunami.
There are many replicas being produced in the area and there are many people trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But, despite that his companions escaped to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the tremor-stricken Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his place to ensure that the Batik 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then, he left the control tower traffic control room when he thought he was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Indonesia's Air Navigation, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision to divert the plane to Darwin could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to carry a sick person to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
This has broken our hearts.
While authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the disaster management agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the rubble and still many bodies that cannot be accessed", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Tsunami waves, with a height of up to six metres, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial planes are carrying food and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Each minute, a ambulance brings bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
All supermarkets have been looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: "The Red Cross is working with the Indonesian Red Cross to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find."
This is a tragedy, but it could get worse.
The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu Sunday and said to the army: "Please work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?
Indonesia has suffered a second earthquake this year on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says now that a man went missing after the crash in the lagoon.
The airline that operated a flight that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean off the Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, even though previously they said the entire passenger and crew had evacuated safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, from Saturday afternoon, they could not find a passenger.
The airline is working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the sea while trying to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities reported that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital and all were in good health.
The exact reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the US Navy both claimed that the plane had landed in the lake because the runway was too short.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes told us that the plane was going very low.
It was extremely positive.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to walk on water to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the flight crew had panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that sailors working on a nearby pier also helped in the rescue by using a floating inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank some 30 metres deep.
The Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
A chronicler compiles a chronology of the night that burned a woman alive.
The prosecution will conclude its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of murdering his wife in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst from the Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness for the defense.
He described how he used the phone's records to construct the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police talked to Sanford.
Sunday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the van with Sanford that night, Sanford said he had lied, as his car was in Nashville.
Another incoherency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that they only met for the first time a week ago.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis suppressed text messages, phone calls, and contact information from Chambers' phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Hale.
The defense will be arguing their final arguments Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be completed by noon the same day.
The High Breed: What is hip-hop consciousness?
A trio of hip-hop artists are using their music to challenge the negative stereotypes of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has drifted from its original messages of social and political awareness to more commercial and pop-oriented lyrics.
They want to return to their roots and re-introduce hip-hop consciousness.
Some artists, like The Fugees and Common, have recently experienced a recent revival in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Maid in New York sues couple for firing after racist text
A nanny in New York City has filed a discrimination complaint after being fired after receiving a text message from the mother who protested because she was "a black person."
The couple denies being racist and compare the suit to a "ransom".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was distressed to see that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first arrived to work on the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOO A NEGROWN WOMAN!", wrote the lady Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
But, instead of sending him to his husband, he sent him to the lady Maurice, twice.
After discovering his mistake, a "uncomfortable" lady Plasco-Flaxman fired the maid who had fired the wrong woman, saying that the maid who had fired the wrong woman had made a bad job of her work and that she expected a Filipina, according to the New York Post.
The lady Maurice received her payment for her day's work and, afterwards, she was sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims compensation for dismissal and asks for a daily compensation of, approximately, 350 USD per day for the job with six-month residency for which they had hired her, even though there was no contract.
I want to show them that it is not possible to do things like that.
The couple have responded to the comments that they were racists by saying that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they had no confidence in her after she had offended them.
His wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
It is not racist.
We're not racist people.
But, would you leave your children in the hands of someone who you know to be a groller, even if it was by accident?
A baby?
Hello!
Plasco, who has compared the demand with an "extortion", said he was "still in a very difficult situation."
Go after that thing?
It is not a very nice attitude.
The legal case is still not settled and the public opinion has already applauded the couple and condemned their behaviour and their logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, in accordance with a letter from the publisher.
It's hard to put yourself in someone else's place before you read the book for the first time.
It is very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington's success.
He explained that his father, who had worked for the BBC before having the inspiration to write the book about a little stuffed os, was optimistic about the rejection of the book. Also, he said the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agreeable", after his death last year.
Describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and affirms that his father was very proud of the success he had achieved.
He was a man of discretion, not a presumptuous one.
But, like Paddington was so real to him, he was actually quite proud when his son achieved something: you're proud even if it's not your own.
I think he considered it an achievement of Paddington.
Although he was the creator and imagination behind Paddington, he always acknowledged the ownership of his creation.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
They landed, and quickly took her to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked futilely to save her life.
He never called frequently to say that he was very sick and that they did not expect him to survive.
Then Nad called me and said that I was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
I did it.
I said to him: "Tashi, I love you so much, pretty baby."
I will soon be with you.
I will go with you.
The medications that had been given to keep his heart beating were being consumed and were beginning to be processed out of his body.
He died before the expected date and so everything went dark.
He knew that he was going to be king, but he did not know when.
I could not cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep my manners.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now deeply saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience she was having.
"No one knew it".
He had a sad face and tears were falling.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt a sympathetic feeling for Nad.
The feeling that I needed my love and my understanding.
I know he loved her.
Dones of mourning hang cards to prevent suicides over a bridge.
Two women who have lost people they loved who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and numbers to which citizens can call for help.
The son of the lady Davis, Tyler, had 13 years when he began to suffer from a depression and, at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent or parent to feel what I feel every day."
The Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up any room.
However, he abandoned his job before dying because he was in a "very dark place."
The brother of Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
The lady Davis said: "I'm constantly concerned that there might be a side effect."
The lady Davis created the cards so that people know that there are people to whom you can turn, who can listen, even if it is a friend.
Don't be silent: speak up.
The Mrs. Humphreys, who is a long-time friend of the Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
He never said he was sick or depressed.
Before Christmas, there was a change in attitude.
He went down in the bottom when the kids opened their Christmas presents and he didn't look at them in the eyes.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they must work: "Open a hole in the family.
He destroys us.
But we must continue and fight.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance while the FBI begins an investigation
I thought we could get something like what he asked (a limited investigation with a time and scope limit), we could possibly get some sort of unity, he said. Also, I feared that the committee would be destroyed by the rooted deadlock of supporters.
Why did the Republicans not want an FBI investigation of Kavanaugh?
His resistance to change is due to the time.
Only five weeks away from the midterm elections of November 6. If Republicans do not do well, they will be weakened in the House of Representatives, making it more difficult for them to get their candidate elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has been hanging up the phone to pressure the senators to support the Kavanaugh, who has worked for the Bush family at the White House. He also met his wife Ashley through the Bush family, as she was his secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where, currently, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
The senate is not expected to reach a decision on the nomination before the end of the year.
The number of defectors from North Korea "drops" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said 1,127 desertions occurred in 2012, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and the increasing prices charged by human smugglers were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public statement.
Typical of deserters from the North, most of them are offered South Korean nationality.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally from 1953 onward.
The majority escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the DMZ between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters migrants illegal, rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which technically still are in war, have improved considerably in the last months.
The leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in early May to discuss the ongoing nuclear talks.
This happened after the historic meeting between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work to achieve a peaceful, nuclear-free Korea.
But on Saturday, the foreign minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions of the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"Unless we have confidence in the United States, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally", said the South Korean ambassador to the United Nations, Yun Byung-se.
Nancy Pelosi says Kavanaugh is a "histrician" and that he is not suitable for working on the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "histrician" and that his temperament does not qualify him to work on the Supreme Court.
The Texas Tribune Festival is a festival that celebrates Texas history and culture.
I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted in this way, she would have been called a "histrician", Pelosi said in reference to her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. Senate.
Kavanaugh, overwhelmed by the accusations, denied the allegations.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, screaming and sometimes falling backwards while speaking of his family and his years at school.
He also condemned the Democratic Committee's accusations against him as a "murder grotesque and coordinated of a character" organized by liberal angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he had prejudices against Democrats, which showed his bias against Democrats.
I think he has himself disqualified himself by making these remarks and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats.
Pelosi showed no interest when asked if she would challenge the confirmation of Kavanaugh, if confirmed, and if Democrats can achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
"That is what I can say: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he isn't qualified to be on the Supreme Court.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi was concerned that Kavanaugh might make decisions that would undermine the Affordable Care Act or the case Roe v. Wade, which she considers to be a conservative court.
At his confirmation hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would annul certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for a person with histrionic and prejudicial views to enter the court and expect us to seem amazing."
Women have to exercise their power.
It is a diatribe justified: months and years of fierce rage and he cannot stop crying without weeping.
"We cry when we angry", said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think so. I think it's not common."
I continued... "A woman who was an executive in some place that I was told was a woman who was angry when she was angry, but developed a tactic that consisted of saying to the person with whom she was speaking: "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm sad.
I'm angry.
Then he continued.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed as a means of releasing rage in part because, in part, they are misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have of a first job with a majority of men, is the one of a woman older than me, who once got me so mad (a frighteningly cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
"Never let them see you crying", he said.
They don't know that you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be glad to see you, because they will have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The year 1987, when the Monkey Business captain Hart was discovered in an extramarital affair on board a yacht called Monkey Business and retired from the race, the lady Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to present herself as a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision", he said while laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates for the job and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because he arrived late to the campaign, he was behind in fundraising, so he promised to not enter the race if he did not raise the money.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who were willing to give 1,000 USD to men only, were willing to give only 250 USD to her.
"Do they think I have a discount?", asked.
When she announced that she would not be running for office, she was overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and for orienting herself toward the delegates, rather than toward the voters, and anger, and sexism, and rage, and anger, and rage, and anger, and rage, and anger, and rage, and anger, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage, and rage
"He could have been suffering from a nervous breakdown" recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press.
I could have been expected to think my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will be written on my tomb?
"He cried?"
How China's war with the US can benefit Pekin.
The initial wartime salves of the trade war between China and the United States were loud and unmistakable, and it seems that the war will not end soon, but it may be beneficial for China to remain apart from the United States for a long time, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, issued his first warning in early this year, when he imposed tariffs on major exports from China, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant new tax increase this week was a new set of tariffs that affected goods worth 200,000 million USD. These taxes are imposed on half of all goods that arrive from China.
People in China have responded by raising their own tariffs on goods from the United States by 10 percent.
China has committed to replicate the United States and is unlikely to back down.
Washington's decision to back down from a trade war with China would be too shameful for him to publicly bend to China, which would be too shameful for him to publicly bend to Xi Jinping, the President of China.
Beijing is playing harder to play the game of power than it has in the past.
"The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that initiate a collapse in any of these countries is very much more dangerous than the witnesses had anticipated", says Abigail Grace, a senior research associate at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says Foreign Affairs Minister
Syria says it is ready to welcome refugees home, and asks for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by a seven-year war.
Before the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said the conditions in the country were improving.
Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country where they were forced to flee as a result of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their lives daily and their maintenance.
The European Union estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime appreciates any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he said he would not accept any help from the countries that funded the rebellion.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the American team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team won the World Cup when the team captained by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for much of the tournament, hit his approach to the par-three 16th hole into the water, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his series and became the fourth player to achieve the 5-0-0 since the format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was dropped from the European team after a 5&4 by the player with the lowest score in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, of Denmark.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most successful golfer, with 25.5 career points.
I don't cry often, but today I can't avoid it.
It has been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy I've recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... I'm happy to have helped, and I'm happy to have won.
Passes the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a one-man competition on Sunday.
I am incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him.
Woods lost four of his last five matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players to have ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf of high quality during the entire tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, was proud of his players, they fought.
This morning there has been a moment when we have pressed the European team.
We have fought.
I'm flattered by your honour.
He is a great captain.
His teammates have played very well.
We will re-group, work with the PGA of America and our committee of the Ryder Cup and progress will be made.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to have been their captain.
There is no doubt that the King's English is excellent.
They have defeated us.
Actualization of the red tide: the concentrations are reduced to Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in certain areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there are more scattered conditions of proliferation in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which suggests a lower concentration.
The red tide extends along the entire coastline of Pinellas County, from the north to Lee County.
They can be found at 16 km from the coast of the county of Hillsborough, but in fewer places than the week before.
The red tide is also known as the "red tide" or "red algae".
The following counties have been notified of concentrations of low to moderate levels of mercury in the coastal and inland waters of the counties of Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, Charlotte, Lee, and Collier.
There are still reports of respiratory irritations in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in the North East Florida area during the past week.
