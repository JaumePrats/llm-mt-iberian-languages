Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RPSCA) are calling again for the mandatory installation of closed-circuit television cameras at all Australian slaughterhouses.
RSPCA New South Wales Chief Inspector David O'Shannessy told the ABC that vigilance and inspection of scavengers should be a standard practice in Australia.
CCTV would surely send the powerful message to people who work with animals, that their welfare is of the utmost priority.
The United States Geological Survey map of international earthquake activity showed no seismic activity in Iceland the week before.
The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reported a lack of seismic activity in the Hekla area during the last 48 hours.
The significant seismic activity resulting from the phase change had occurred on March 10 on the northeastern face of the volcano's caldera.
Dark clouds have been reported at the base of the mountain, unrelated to any volcanic activity.
The clouds could potentially cause confusion about whether there had been a real eruption.
Luno contained 120-160 cubic metres of fuel on board when it broke and was pushed into the breakwater amidst strong winds and waves.
Helicopters rescued the 12 crew members and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-meter ship was en route to collect its usual load of fertilizer and authorities were initially concerned that the ship might spill a load.
The proposed amendment had already been passed by both houses in 2011.
A change occurred in this legislative session when the second sentence was deleted first by the House of Representatives and then similarly approved by the Senate on Monday.
The rejection of the second statement, which proposes to ban civil unions between people of the same sex, could open the door to civil unions in the future.
Following the process, HJR-3 will be revised again by the newly elected legislature in 2015 or 2016.
Vautier's successes outside of directing included a 1973 hunger strike against what he saw as political censorship.
His activism began at the age of 15 when he joined the French Resistance during World War II.
In 1998 he documented himself in a book.
He returned to newly independent Algeria to teach film direction in the 1960s.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, winner of two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was announced as intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died Tuesday in Osaka.
In addition to being an Olympic and world champion, Saito was the chairman of the training committee of the National Judo Federation of Japan at the time of his death.
At least 100 people attended the party to celebrate the first anniversary of a couple who had married last year.
As reported by the authorities, a formal birthday event was scheduled for a later date.
The couple had married in Texas a year earlier and had come to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old Buffalo native was one of four people killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English tutor, who taught classes at Modern Education and King's Glory schools and claimed to have 9,000 students at the peak of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some family members considered vulgar, and he allegedly blasphemed in the classroom.
Modern Education has accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorization and of lying about being the most important English teacher.
He was also previously accused of copyright infringement, but was not charged.
One former student said that he "used slang in class, taught dating skills with grades, and was like the friend of the students".
Over the past three decades, despite officially remaining a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic level has increased 90 times.
For the first time, China exported more cars last year than Germany and surpassed the United States as the largest market for its industry.
In two decades, China's GDP could surpass that of the United States.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center are predicting that Danielle will increase in intensity to a hurricane category by next Wednesday.
As the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, Bobek became famous while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined in 1945 and remained until 1958.
He scored 403 goals in 468 matches during his time with the team.
No one has ever played more games or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995 he was voted the best player in Partizan's history.
The celebrations began with a special program by the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
Next, the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a band of genissers, and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses performed.
Then the Whirling Dervishes came on stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
As the end of the show, the Turkish dance company Fire of Anatolia showed the audience their "Troy" performance.
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, has died after being involved in an accident at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
While doing the warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his motorcycle, and was then run over by fellow racer, Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately treated by the circuit medical team and transferred to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat emerged unscathed from the accident.
Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero went on to say that "the financial system is a part of the economy, a crucial part.
We have a year-long crisis, which has had its most acute moment in the last two months, and I think now the financial markets are starting to recover".
Last week, Naked News announced a significant increase in its commitment to international language news, with three new programs.
The global organization is already reporting in English and Japanese, and is launching programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, the web and mobile devices.
Fortunately, I was not hurt, but I saw a gruesome scene of people trying to break windows to get out.
People tried to break the windows with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
Eventually one of the windows broke, and they started to go out the window, said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Stars emit light and heat because of the energy generated when hydrogen atoms join together (or fuse) to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will be many years before we see functional fusion reactors.
The steel needle floats on water due to surface tension.
Surface tension occurs because water molecules on the surface attract each other more strongly than they do air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible skin on the surface of the water that allows things like needles to rise above the water.
The blade of a modern ice rink has a double edge with a concave hole in the middle. The two edges allow better adhesion on the ice, even when tilted.
As the base of the sheet is slightly curved, so as the sheet tilts to one side or the other, the edge that is in contact with the ice also bends.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns to the left.
In order to return to their previous energy level, they must release any extra energy they have gained from the light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light that we call a photon.
Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because the atoms are stimulated with white light, causing a photon of light to be emitted, and light is a type of radiation.
The next image shows the atoms emitting photons, and of course, the photons are actually much smaller than the ones shown in the figure.
Photons are even smaller than the stuff that makes up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament of the bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb stops working.
So the light bulb has to be changed. You have to be careful to change the light bulb.
First, you have to close the light switch or disconnect the wire.
The reason is that the electricity that flows through the endol where the metal part of the bulb is can severely electrocute you if you touch the inside of the switch or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partially inside the endol.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps blood.
Blood leaves the heart through ducts called arteries and returns to the heart through ducts called veins.
The teeth of a triceratops could chew not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that Triceratops ate cycads, a type of plant common in the Cretaceous.
These plants resemble a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, spiny leaves.
A triceratop might have used its strong beak to remove the stretched leaves before eating the sap.
Other scientists claim that these plants are highly poisonous, so it is unlikely that a dinosaur would have eaten them, although the periscus and other animals such as the weasel (a descendant of dinosaurs) can now eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you were standing on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than if you were standing on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds on Io, so obviously gravity is pushing you with less force.
The Sun doesn't have a crust like the Earth that you can stand on.
The gas becomes more diluted as you move away from the center of the Sun.
The outer part of the Sun that we see when we look at it is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light".
Some three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to discover that Venus has phases, just like the moon.
The phases are explained by the fact that only the face of Venus (or the Moon) facing the Sun is illuminated. The phases of Venus supported Copernicus' theory that the planets move around the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England lived a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelaw.
However, in 991 Aethelred had to face the largest Viking fleet seen since Guthrum a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian who had ambitions to recover his country from Danish domination.
After initial military setbacks, Ethelred was able to agree terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to attempt to win his kingdom with relative success.
Hangul is the only arbitrarily created alphabet that has widespread use in daily life. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth monarch of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the most well-regarded.
He initially named the Hangeul alphabet as Hunmin Jeongeum, meaning "the correct sounds for popular instruction".
There are many theories about the origins of Sanskrit, one of which is that an Aryan migration from the West to India brought the language there.
Sanskrit is an ancient language comparable to Latin that was spoken in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit simply dissipated because of hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very rich and complex language that has served as the source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin did for European languages like French and Spanish.
After the Battle of France, Germany began preparing to invade the island of Brittany.
Germany gave the attack the code name "Operation Sea Lion".[citation needed] Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost in the Dunkirk evacuation, so the army was rather weak.
However the Royal Navy was still far more powerful than the German ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any invading fleet attempting to cross the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy warships were based near the likely invasion routes, as admirals feared they would be sunk by a German air attack.
Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was basically the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
It had a land army and weaker naval forces, although it had built four new ships just before the war began.
Italy's main targets were African countries, and to capture those countries, they would need a troop launching pad so that the troops could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
To do this, they had to free themselves from British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from these actions, the naval battles of Italy had no other objective.
As for Japan, this was an island country, like Britain.
Submarines are vessels designed to travel underwater and remain there for a long period of time.
Submarines were used during World War I and World War II, but were very slow and had a very limited range.
At the beginning of the war, they were mostly moving on the surface of the sea, but as soon as radar started to develop, and to become more reliable, submarines were forced to go underwater to avoid being seen.
The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines.
After his success with submarines, after the war he does not trust the fact that the Germans have submarines.
King Tutankhamun, sometimes called "King Tut" or "The Child King", is one of the best-known Egyptian kings in modern times.
It is interesting to note that it was not considered very important during antiquity and was not recorded in most ancient royal lists.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many tombs of the past have been looted, this tomb remained virtually intact.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of radiated wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better equipped to escape soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows of their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. Around 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the knee-length Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists, but perhaps the most famous person in Greek culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature, the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still famous playwrights and their works are among the best productions in the world of literature.
Pythagoras is another famous Greek mathematician, chiefly remembered for his famous theorem on the relationships of the sides of right triangles.
There are various estimates of the number of speakers of Hindi, with estimates ranging from the second to the fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers depends on whether similar dialects are counted.
Estimates range from 340 to 500 million speakers, and there are up to 800 million people who can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary, but distinct in writing; in everyday conversation, speakers of both languages can often usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under a strong cultural influence of Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the natives, so they invented the written Estonian language.
It was based on the German alphabet and added the character "Õ/õ".
As time went on, many words borrowed from German merged together, and this was the beginning of the Enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne would go straight into the army after finishing school.
However, Charles went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, gaining a 2:2 (a lower second-class degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to achieve a university degree.
European Turkey (east of Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) makes up 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is over 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
The area of Turkey, including the lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) are in southwestern Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 sq mi) in Europe.
Turkey's land area makes it the 37th largest country in the world, and it is roughly the same size as metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by seas in three parts: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it did not become independent until 1839.
Parts of what is now Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but was occupied by Germany in both World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery at the top of Paro Ward (in Phondey Village).
It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
Due to a fire in 1951, today only some of the relics of Drukgyal Dzong are preserved, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
The fort was preserved and protected after the fire, and remains one of Bhutan's most impressive attractions.
In the 18th century, Cambodia found itself torn between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thai invaded Cambodia many times during the 18th century and in 1722 destroyed Phnom Penh.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who have a job work in the underground economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans who work are in the service sector, almost a quarter work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for Venezuelans, the country is a net exporter, although only one percent of the population works in it.
In the early days of the nation's independence, experts from the Singapore Botanic Garden collaborated in transforming the island into a tropical Garden City.
In 1981 the Vanda Miss Joaquim, a hybrid of orchids, was chosen as the national flower of the country.
Each year around October, about 1.5 million herbivores travel to the southern plains, crossing the Mara River from the northern hills for rains.
And then back north from the west, crossing the Mara River again, looking for the rains that come in April.
The Serengeti region is home to the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and everyday skills, as well as tools that are mastered in interactive classes (creation of illustrated scripts, audio and video editing, story telling, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to re-evaluate your assumptions about audiovisual production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
Interactive design requires components of a project to connect with each other, but it also makes sense as a separate entity.
The drawback of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements needed to achieve a range of focal lengths is much higher than for fixed lenses.
This is becoming less important as lens manufacturers are meeting higher standards in lens production.
This allows zoomed lenses to produce images of a quality comparable to that obtained by fixed focal length lenses.
Another disadvantage of augmented lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually less.
This makes it difficult to use economical zoom lenses in low light conditions without a flash.
One of the most common problems when converting a movie to DVD format is over-scan.
Most television is made in such a way that it appeals to the general public.
For this reason, everything you see on TV has been trimmed at the edges, at the top, at the bottom and at the edges.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, the chances are that the edges will be cut out, and if the video has subtitles too close to the bottom, they won't show at all.
The traditional medieval castle has long stimulated the imagination, evoking images of Arthurian fairs, banquets and revelry.
Even as you stand among the ruins of a thousand years ago, it's easy to think of the sounds and smells of battles from another era, to almost hear the impact of helmets on tiles, and to sense fear climbing through the windows of the dungeons.
Now, is our imagination based on reality? Why did someone build castles in the first place? What was the design and construction process like?
Typical of the era, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more like a fortified house than a proper castle.
Its large glass windows and thin walls would not have been able to withstand an attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began to build it, the country was in a state of relative peace and only needed defence against small bands of wandering marauders.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept was that all European nations had to look to prevent any one nation from becoming too powerful, and for this reason it was common for the governments of the different countries to change their alliances in order to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession marked the first war in which the main conflict was the balance of power.
This was a major turning point, as the European powers would no longer have the pretext of religious wars, and the Thirty Years' War would therefore be considered the last religious war.
The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BCE in a fire started by Herodotus.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at any cost, and the indignant Ephesians announced that Herodotus' name would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo recorded the name later, and that's how we know it today.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but his offer was rejected.
Make sure that your right hand is as relaxed as possible, while still playing all the notes correctly; also, you should try not to make too many unnecessary finger movements.
Remember, you do not have to press the keys harder to get more volume, as you do with the piano.
To have more volume in the accordion, the sleeve is used with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the search for communion, identity or consciousness with a human reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, an intuition or perception of the divine reality/deity or deities.
Followers pursue a certain way of life, or practices that are designed to promote these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, particularly those of a peaceful, insightful, joyful or even ecstatic nature.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their faith to be a different religion from Hinduism although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion gurmat which means "the path of the guru" in Punjabi. The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has taken on a central importance and forms the core of Sikh beliefs.
Guru Nanak (1469-1539) founded the religion in the 15th century, and nine other gurus followed.
However, in June 1956 Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland, where workers complained of lack of food and wage cuts, became a general protest against communism.
Although in the end Khrushchev sent tanks to restore order, he caved in to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladislaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent including most of present-day Pakistan and some regions in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The civilization appeared in the Indus River basin from which it derives its name.
Some scholars argue that, since the civilization also existed in the basins of the now dry Sarasvati River, a more appropriate name would be the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, while others call it the Harappa civilization, in reference to the first site excavated in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the development of medical advances.
Physicians began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman medical corps for after battles.
Surgeons were familiar with several sedatives, including morphine from opium seed extracts and scopolamine from dandelion seeds.
They became adept at amputation to save patients from gangrene and in tourniquets and hemostasis to cut off blood flow.
For several centuries, the Roman Empire brought great advances in the field of medicine and shaped much of the knowledge we know today.
Pureland origami is a kind of origami with the restriction that only one fold can be made at a time, no more complex folds such as inverted folds are allowed, and all folds have a simple placement.
It was developed by John Smith during the 1970s to help inexperienced practitioners or those with limited motor skills.
Children develop racial awareness and racial stereotypes from a very young age, and these racial stereotypes influence behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority that carries the stereotype of not doing well in school tend to do poorly in school once they have learned the stereotype that their race is associated with.
MySpace is the third most popular website in use in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the educational environment.
These websites have positive aspects, such as the ability to easily set up a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos and other features.
This page can be accessed by providing just a web address, which makes it easy to remember and easy to type for students who may have trouble using the keyboard or with spelling.
It can be customized to be easy to read and also with as much or as little color as you want.
Attention Deficit Disorder "is a neurological syndrome that has been classically defined as a symptomatology that includes impulsivity, tendency to distraction, and hyperactivity or excess energy".
It is not a learning disability but a learning disorder, "affecting between three and five percent of all children, perhaps as many as two million children in the United States".
Children with attention deficit disorder have difficulty focusing on things like homework, but they can focus on things they enjoy, such as playing video games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble, because they "engage in risky behavior, in fights and challenge authority" to stimulate their brains, since their brains cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
ADHD affects peer relationships because other children cannot understand why they act the way they do or why they speak the way they do or why their level of maturity is different.
As the capacity to acquire knowledge and learn has changed, as mentioned above, so has the base rate at which knowledge is gained.
The way information was obtained was different, the focus was no longer on individual memory, but rather on the ability to recall a text.
In essence, the Renaissance was a significant change in the way learning and the dissemination of knowledge were approached.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move, to support their weight, or to swing between trees.
The hands and feet of chimpanzees are similar in size and length, showing the use of the hand to carry weight in locomotion over the joints.
The human hand is shorter than the feet, with more right phalanges.
Fossilised hand bones from two to three million years ago show this leap in hand specialization from locomotion to manipulation.
There are people who believe that experiencing many artificially induced lucid dreams can often be very exhausting.
The main explanation for this phenomenon is that as a consequence of lucid dreaming, the time between REM states is lengthened.
With less MOR per night, this state in which you currently experience sound and your body recovers becomes rare enough to be a problem.
This is as exhausting as if you had to get up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to have lucid dreams every night.
Things did not go very well for the Italians in North Africa almost from the start. Only a week after Italy declared war, on 10 June 1940, the Eleventh Hussar Division captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.
Marshal Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and natural successor to Mussolini, was assassinated by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk on 28 June.
The modern sport of fencing is practiced at many levels, from students learning it in college to professionals and Olympic competitors.
The sport is primarily played in a duel format, with one fencing player fighting another fighter in a duel.
Golf is a game in which players use clubs to hit balls and try to get them into a hole.
A typical round is played over eighteen holes; players usually start on the first hole of the course and finish on the eighteenth.
The winner is the player who needs the fewest strokes, or club swings, to complete the circuit.
This game is played on grass and the grass around the hole is cut shorter and is called the green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is the one most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
It's when people go to a place very different from their everyday life to relax and have fun.
Usually, the most frequented places by recreational tourists are beaches, theme parks and campgrounds.
When the purpose of visiting a particular place is to learn about its history and culture, we are talking about cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit different landmarks in a particular country or simply decide to concentrate on a single area.
The settlers, seeing this activity, also called for reinforcements.
The troops that reinforced the forward positions included the 200-man 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments under the control of Col. John Stark and Col. James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's men took up positions along the fence at the northern end of the settlers' location.
They quickly extended the fence northward with a low stone wall that ended at the water's edge on a small beach, just after the low tide opened a crack along the Mystic River, northeast of the peninsula.
Gridley or Stark planted a stake about 30 metres (100 ft) in front of the fence and ordered that no one should fire until the British army had overrun it.
The American plan was to launch coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder would launch a divisive attack against the British garrison at Bordentown, in order to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing would take 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over the Assunpink Creek, and prevent the enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force, of 2,400 men, was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, with the aim of launching an attack before dawn.
With the change from a quarter mile to a half mile, speed becomes much more relevant and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
A first-class half-mile runner, a man who can beat two minutes, obviously must possess considerable speed, but must cultivate endurance to any kind of danger.
Some cross country running during the winter, combined with upper-body gym work, is the best preparation for the racing season.
Proper nutritional practices by themselves cannot generate elite performance, but can significantly affect the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, having effective hydration habits, and understanding the different aspects of supplementation can help athletes improve performance and enjoy sports more.
Half marathon racing is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there is much confusion as to the few pieces of equipment needed to participate.
Products can be purchased whenever needed, but most will have little or no real impact on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even if it offers no real benefits.
The atom can be considered one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.
It is a very complex entity consisting, according to a simplified Bohr model, of a central nucleus orbited by electrons, similar in some ways to the planets orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons have no charge.
Before you can check on the victim's condition, you need to inspect the scene to ensure your own safety.
You need to observe the victim's position as you approach and any automatic warning signals.
If you hurt yourself trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that fear and catastrophizing mediated the relationship between pain and disability in those with back pain.
Only the effects of catastrophism, and not depression or fear, were conditioned by regular weekly sessions of physical activity.
Those who were regularly active required more assistance in terms of negative pain perception, while distinguishing the differences between chronic pain and discomfort caused by normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, or eyes.
There are many different eye structures, varying in complexity according to the requirements of the organism.
Different constructs have different possibilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different levels of sharpness, and also require different processing to make sense of the incoming stimulus and different numbers to work optimally.
A population is the set of organisms of a particular species in a particular geographical area.
Monomorphs are all individuals in a population that share a particular phenotypic characteristic.
Individuals who show different variants of a particular trait are polymorphic.
Colonies of legionary ants also move out and build the nest in different phases.
In the nomadic phase, legionary ants move at night and stop to camp during the day.
The colony enters a nomadic phase when the available food has decreased, during which the colony builds temporary nests that are changed daily.
Each of these marches or parades lasts approximately 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin "cella", meaning "little room", and was first used by a microscopist when observing the structure of the cell.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and essential in the study of life that they are in fact often called "the building blocks of life".
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood flow running and unaltered.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly through the body that they help keep you safe from any potential threat.
Tornadoes strike a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes uproot trees, break the joints of buildings, and hurl cars into the air. Two percent of the most violent tornadoes last more than three hours.
These monstrous storms have winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Humans have been making and using magnifying lenses for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first true telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and the nature of collaboration lies in the fact that when the majority benefits from something, there will always be more to gain in the short term by acting in a selfish way.
Hopefully, most people will realize that the best long-term option is to work together with each other.
Many people dream of the day when humans will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people wonder what's out there, some believe in extraterrestrials or that life can be found on another planet.
But if that happens, it probably won't be for long, because the stars are so scattered, there are billions of kilometers between the "neighbors".
Maybe one day, your grandkids will be planted on an alien world reflecting on their ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells, they eat things and digest things inside of them, most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (though not all do; jellyfish, for example, do not).
There are animals all over the Earth, they dig in the ground, they swim in the oceans, they fly in the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism (thing).
Cell comes from the Latin word cella, meaning small room.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you'll notice that they're made up of little squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, an English biologist, observed small squares of sulfur under a microscope.
He was the first person to observe dead cells in the blood.
Elements and compounds can move from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen in gaseous form still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen, but the liquid state is denser, but the molecules remain the same.
Water is another example. Composite water is made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
It has the same molecular structure in solid, liquid and gas states.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical composition does not.
Time is something that surrounds us everywhere and affects everything we do, and yet it's hard to understand.
Religious scholars, philosophers, and scientists have studied time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that pass from the future through the present to the past.
Time also consists of the comparison we make of the duration (length) of events.
You can mark the passage of time for yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens again and again on a regular basis.
Computers today are used to manipulate images and videos.
Sophisticated computer animations can be constructed, and this kind of animation is increasingly used in television and film.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and combine sounds.
For a long time in the 19th century, the first inhabitants of New Zealand were believed to be the Maori, hunters of giant birds called moas.
Later the theory established the concept that the Maori had migrated from Polynesia in a Great Fleet and taken New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society there.
However, there is new evidence to suggest that the Moriori were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, where they developed a distinct and peaceful culture.
There is also another tribe in the Chatham Islands; they were Maori who migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori, there were a few fights and in the end, the Moriori were wiped out
The people who have been involved for a few decades have helped us appreciate our strengths and passions, while we openly assess the difficulties and even the failures.
As we listened to people sharing personal, family and organizational stories, we gained insight into the past and some of the personalities who have influenced the culture of the organization for good or for bad.
While understanding one's own history doesn't mean understanding the culture, at least it helps people get a sense of where they are in the history of the organization.
As they confirm successes and become aware of failures, individuals and the group of participants discover more deeply the values, mission and driving forces of the organization.
In this case, remembering past experiences of entrepreneurial behavior and the resulting successes helped people to remain open to new changes and the new direction of the local church.
Such success stories diminished fears of change, creating a positive vision of change in the future.
Convergent thinking patterns are problem-solving techniques that bring together different ideas or fields to find a solution.
The focus of this mindset is speed, logic and accuracy, also fact-finding, reapplying existing techniques, information gathering.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is that there is only one right answer, and you only think of two answers, which is right or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific procedures or standards.
People with this thinking caste have logical thinking, can memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
Humans are by far the most gifted species at reading the minds of others.
This implies that we can satisfactorily predict what other humans perceive, intend, believe, know, or desire.
Among these skills, it is essential to understand the intentions of others, which allows us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone break a car window, you probably assume that he is trying to steal someone else's car.
He would be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and the vehicle he was trying to break into was his.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (who worked at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (of Harvard University).
In that resonance, the magnetic field and the radio waves cause the atoms to emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970 Raymond Damadian, a physician and research assistant, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later a patent was granted, which was the first patent in the world to be granted in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "whole-body" MRI scanner, which he christened the "Indomable".
Asynchronous communication favors time for reflection and reaction to others.
This allows students to work at their own pace and to control the pace of instructional information.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions with the possibility of flexible working hours (Bremer, 1998).
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows students to have access to information at all times.
Instead of waiting until the next face-to-face meeting, students can also ask questions of instructors at any time of the day and expect reasonably quick answers.
The postmodern approach to learning offers the freedom of absolutes.
In fact, there is nothing worth learning about. Learning takes place in the experience between the student and the knowledge presented.
Our current experience with all the do-it-yourself TV shows and the information they present illustrates this point.
Many of us find ourselves watching a television program that informs us about a process or experience that we will never participate in or apply our knowledge of.
We're never going to be overhauling a car, building a fountain in our backyard, traveling to Peru to see ancient ruins, or remodeling our neighbor's house.
Thanks to submarine fibre optic cables to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected with 93 percent of the population having internet access.
Your hotel or host (if you stay in a guesthouse or a private home) will likely have Wi-Fi or a computer connected to the Internet, and all settlements will have an Internet cafe or some location with public Wi-Fi.
As mentioned earlier, although the word "Eskimo" is still used in the United States, many Arctic peoples outside the U.S. find it offensive, especially in Canada.
Although you may hear Greenlandic natives using the word, foreigners should avoid using it.
The native inhabitants of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and kalaalleq (plural kalaallit), a Greenlandic, in Greenland.
Crime and ill-will towards foreigners in general is almost non-existent in Greenland. There are not even "danger zones" in the cities.
Cold weather is possibly the only real danger facing the unprepared.
If you visit Greenland during the cold seasons (bearing in mind that the further north you go, the colder it will be), it is essential to bring enough clothing to cover yourself.
Extremely long summer days can lead to problems getting enough sleep and associated health problems.
In summer, beware of Nordic mosquitoes, which, although not transmitting any disease, can be irritating.
Although San Francisco's economy has much to do with being a world-class tourist attraction, its economy is diversified.
The most extensive sectors of employment are professional services, administration, finance, trade and tourism.
Its frequent representation in music, film, literature, and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks recognized around the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants, and first-class convention centers.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country to enjoy other Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
A trip to Walt Disney World is a true pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" visit consists of flying into Orlando International Airport, traveling by coach to a Disney hotel, spending a week without leaving the Disney facilities, and returning home.
There's an infinite variety of possibilities, but that's what most people mean when they say "going to Disneyland".
Many of the tickets sold on the Internet through auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day tickets.
Although it is a very common activity, it is prohibited by Disney: tickets are non-transferable.
A hiking permit is required to camp beneath the rim of the Grand Canyon.
Permits are limited to protect the ravine, and are available on the 1st of the month, four months before the start of the month.
Thus, a field permit for any date in May will be available on January 1.
Spaces in the better-known areas, such as Bright Angel Camp adjacent to Phantom Ranch, are usually filled with applications received on the first day that the reservations are open.
There are a limited number of permits reserved for walk-in requests, available on a first-come, first-served basis.
Entering South Africa by car is an impressive way to see all the beauty of the region and to get to places off the most usual tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning. However, it is recommended to use a 4x4 and in fact many locations are only accessible with a 4x4 with raised wheels.
Keep in mind, during planning, that while Southern Africa is stable, not all of its neighbors are.
Visa requirements and costs vary from country to country and depend on your country of origin.
In addition, each country has specific laws describing what emergency items must be carried in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in the western portion of Zimbabwe, along the border with Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The city is immediately adjacent to the waterfalls, and they are the main attraction, but this well-known tourist destination offers hikers and adventurers many opportunities for a longer stay.
When the rainy season arrives (November to March), the water volume will rise and the falls will be more spectacular.
You are sure to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the winding paths near the falls.
On the other hand, precisely because the water volume is so high your views of the actual falls will be blocked - by all the water!
KV62 may be the most famous of the tombs in the valley, the scene of Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of the young king's nearly intact royal tomb.
Compared to most other royal tombs, however, Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth visiting, as it is much smaller and with limited decoration.
Anyone interested in seeing the damage samples from the mummy caused by the multiple attempts to remove it from the sarcophagus will be disappointed because only its head and shoulders can be seen.
The tomb's fabulous riches are no longer inside, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
It would be better if visitors who have little time spent elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This mountain-top temple was built in the late 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The climb to the summits is worth it thanks to the temple's tepid atmosphere and its views of the Tonle Sap Lake.
A visit to this place can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake.
You need the Angkor Pass to enter the temple, so don't forget to bring your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although neither most countries nor the United Nations recognize it as the country's capital.
The ancient city in the Judean Hills has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years.
The city is sacred to the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.
Because of the religious significance of the city, and in particular of many sites in the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of Israel's major tourist attractions.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological, and cultural sites, as well as lively and bustling shopping centers, cafes, and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to have received a letter of invitation before entering Ecuador through international airports or border entry points.
This letter must be certified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and meet certain requirements.
The purpose of these requirements is to provide an organized migration flow between both countries.
Cuban citizens who have a U.S. green card must visit the Ecuadorian Consulate to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
The passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the dates of travel. A closed/return ticket is required to prove the length of stay.
Tours are more economical for larger groups, so if you're alone or just with a friend, try to get together with other people and form a group of four to six for a better price per person.
However, this should not worry you too much, for tourists often combine to fill the cars.
It actually seems more like a technique to make people believe they have to pay more.
Standing over the northern head of Machu Picchu is this mountain, often the backdrop of many photographs of the ruins.
It looks a bit imposing from below and it's a steep and difficult climb, but most people in at least moderate shape should be able to do it in about 45 minutes.
Stone stairs are placed along most of the path, and steel cables are laid to support the steepest sections.
That said, expect to run out of air, and be careful in the steepest sections, especially if there's moisture, because it can become dangerous quickly.
Near the summit there is a tiny cave to cross; it is quite low and narrow.
The sights and wildlife of the Galapagos are best viewed by boat, just as Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships sail the Galapagos waters, with capacities of between 8 and 100 passengers.
Most visitors reserve their place well in advance, as the boats are usually full during the high season.
Be assured that the agent who makes your reservation is a Galapagos specialist with a good knowledge of a wide variety of vessels.
This will ensure that your particular interests or limitations are accommodated on the most appropriate vessel.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule, while the indigenous Araucanians (Mapuche) populated central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last Native American groups not to be fully absorbed by Spanish-speaking regulation after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the midst of the French War, which left Spain without a functioning central government for two years), it did not gain decisive victory against the Spanish until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country occupying the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
The country hosts, in addition to white sand beaches and mountainous landscapes, the oldest European city in the Americas, today part of Santo Domingo.
The island was initially inhabited by the Taino and Galibi, an Arawakan-speaking people who arrived around 10,000 BCE.
A few years after the arrival of European explorers, the Spanish conquerors reduced the Taíno population significantly.
According to Fra Bartolomé de las Casas (Treaty of the Indies), between 1492 and 1498, the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Taínos.
Jardín de la Unión: This space was built as the cloister of a 17th-century convent, of which the Templo de San Diego is the only surviving building.
Now it functions as the central square and there is always a lot going on, both day and night.
There are a number of restaurants surrounding the garden, and in the afternoon and evening there are free concerts, often held in the central gazebo.
Callejón del Beso (Kissing alley) Two balconies separated by only 69 centimeters that are the origin of an ancient love legend.
For a few pennies some kids will tell you the story.

Whistler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but is recognized for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter, you can enjoy the best skiing in North America, and in summer, you can enjoy some real mountain biking.
Permits must be booked in advance, you need a permit to spend the night at Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station that offers dormitory and dining accommodations in addition to camping. La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos offer camping only, with no food service.

The park service (MINAE) does not grant access permits more than a month in advance of arrival.
Cafet El Sol offers a reservation service for US$30 or $10 for day passes.
The Cook Islands are an island state in free association with New Zealand, and are located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands spread over 2.2 million square kilometers of ocean.
With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes known as the "Hawaii of Oceania".
Although smaller, some of the older visitors are reminded of Hawaii before it became a state, without the big tourist hotels and other construction.
The Cook Islands are a group of 15 islands, the main ones being Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Today, luxury bed and breakfast in developed countries has become almost an art form.
At the upper end, B&Bs obviously compete mostly on two main things: bed and breakfast.
Consequently, the most luxurious sheets, perhaps a handwoven bathrobe or an antique bed, can be found in these establishments.
Breakfast may include seasonal regional delicacies or the host's specialty.
The stage may be a historic building with antique furniture, well-kept grounds, and a swimming pool.
Getting in your car and taking a long road trip has an inherent appeal in its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you are probably familiar with your car's operation and its limitations.
Setting up a tent on private property or in a town of any size can easily draw unwanted attention.
In short, the car is a great option for a road trip, but it is not usually a form of "camping" in itself.
Car camping is feasible if you have a van, sedan, sport utility vehicle or large van with reclining seats.
Some hotels have a legacy from the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners; before World War II, in the 19th century or early 20th century.
These hotels were where the rich and famous of the time stayed, and often had good food and nightlife.
Vintage accessories, lack of modern conveniences and a certain elegant ageing are also part of its character.
Although usually private properties, they sometimes host visits from heads of state and other dignitaries.
A traveler with a lot of money might consider flying around the world, with breaks to stay in many of these hotels.
A hospitality exchange network is the organization that connects travelers with neighbors in the cities they are visiting.
To join such an atypical network, one generally only needs to fill out a questionnaire, although some networks offer or ask for additional verification.
A list of available hosts is then offered either in printed form or online, sometimes with quotes and opinions from other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 when programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland, but had nowhere to stay.
She wrote letters to students at the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers of free accommodation.
Hostels are usually aimed at a younger audience - a typical host is in his twenties - but often older travellers can be found as well.
Families with children are rare to see, but hotels allow them to stay in private rooms.
The Chinese city of Beijing will be the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Games.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as indoor ice events.
Other skiing events will be held at Taizicheng Ski Area in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 mi) from Beijing.
Most temples celebrate an annual festival that begins between late November and mid-May, and which varies according to each temple's annual calendar.
Most temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple's birthday or the birthday of the presiding deity or any other event associated with the temple.
It is very interesting to see the temple festivals of Kerala; there are periodic processions of tamed elephants, a temple orchestra and other festivities.
A World's Fair (often called a World's Fair, or simply an Expo) is a large international arts and science festival.
Participating countries present artistic and educational displays in national pavilions to showcase world issues or their country's culture and history.
International Horticultural Exhibitions are specialized events that display floral displays, botanical gardens, and anything else related to plants.
Although in theory they are held every year (as long as it is in different countries), in practice not.
These events typically last between three and six months, and are held on sites no smaller than 50 hectares.
Over the years many different film formats have been used, the most common by far being standard 35 mm film (36 by 24 mm negatives).
It can generally be rested fairly easily if it runs out, and offers a resolution comparable to current DSLRs.
Some medium format film cameras use a 6 by 6 cm format, more precisely a 56 by 56 mm negative.
This gives us a resolution almost four times that of a 35 mm negative (3.136 mm2 instead of 864).
Wildlife is one of the most challenging subjects for a photographer, and requires a combination of good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photography is sometimes taken for granted, but like photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens, however, things like a flock of birds or a tiny creature need other lenses.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find, and sometimes parks have rules about commercial photography.
Wild animals can be shy or aggressive, and the environment can be cold, warm, or hostile.
There are over 5,000 different languages in the world, of which more than 20 are spoken by 50 million or more people.
Written words are often easier to understand than spoken words, too. This is especially true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce intelligibly.
There are many nations where English is spoken fluently throughout the territory, and in many others you can expect limited knowledge, especially among the youth.
Imagine, please, one from Manchester, one from Boston, one from Jamaica and one from Sydney sitting around a table in a restaurant in Toronto.
They delight each other with stories from their hometowns, told in their different accents and local slang.
Buying food from supermarkets is often the cheapest way to eat, but if you can't cook, your options are limited to precooked food.
Supermarkets are increasingly offering a variety of prepared foods, some even offering a microwave or other means of heating the dishes.
In some countries or types of shops there is at least one restaurant, often rather informal with affordable prices.
Make copies of your policy and the insurance company's contact information, and hang them upstairs.
These must contain insurer data such as e-mail address and telephone numbers to call from abroad and thus obtain indications/authorisations and also make claims.
Keep another copy in your luggage and online (e-mail the attachment to yourself, or save it to the cloud).
If you travel with a laptop or tablet, keep a copy on your hard drive or disk (which can be accessed without the Internet).
Also hand out copies of the policy/contact traveling companions and relatives or friends who are willing to help.
Ants (also known as wasps) are not inherently aggressive, but will defend themselves if they perceive a threat.
When people don't see ants as potentially dangerous animals, they tend to get too close and, as a result, they can put themselves in danger.
Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it is important to know your own limit.
The potential health effects of excessive drinking, in the long term, can include liver damage and even blindness and death. The potential danger is increased when illegally produced alcohol is consumed.
Illegal liquor can contain several dangerous impurities such as methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can be more economical in a foreign country, especially in low-income countries where production costs are lower.
You might consider getting an eye exam at home, especially if your insurance covers it, and taking the prescription with you to fill out elsewhere.
Luxury brand mounts available in these areas can have two problems: some may be imitations, and the really imported ones may be more expensive than not at home.
Coffee is one of the world's most traded commodities, and you may find many varieties in your area.
Still, there are many different ways of drinking coffee around the globe that are worth trying.
Canyoning consists of reaching the bottom of a canyon, which may be dry or filled with water.
Canyoning combines elements of swimming, climbing, and jumping, but requires relatively little training or physical fitness to begin with (compared to mountain climbing, scuba diving, or alpine skiing, for example).
Hiking is an outdoor activity consisting of walking in natural environments, often along hiking trails.
Day hiking involves distances of less than a mile to longer distances that can be done in a single day.
A day trip on a simple trail requires little preparation, and anyone in moderate shape can join.
Families with young children may need more preparation, but a day outdoors is easily achievable with infants or preschoolers.
Internationally, there are almost 200 tourism organizations in operation. Most of these operate independently.
Global Running Tours' successor, Go Running Tours, connects dozens of outdoor running suppliers across four continents.
With roots in Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, they were quickly joined by Prague-based Running Tours Prague and others.
There are many things you must have in mind before and during a trip to any place.
When traveling, do not expect things to be "like at home". The fashions, laws, food, traffic, accommodations, standards, language, and so forth will be somewhat different from where you live.
This is something that should always be kept in mind, to avoid disappointment or perhaps even dislike of local ways of doing things.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century, and a travel agent is usually a good option for a trip that goes beyond the previous experience of travel with nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
While most agencies are willing to accept more general bookings, many specialize in certain specific types of trips, budget ranges, or destinations.
It may be convenient to use an agent who often book similar trips to yours.
Take a look at the travel agent's listings, either on the website or in the office window.
If you want to see a world with little money, whether it's for need, lifestyle or challenge, there are a number of ways to do it.
This article focuses on the latter, which is to say, either you work while you travel or you try to limit your expenses.
For those willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to bring costs down to near zero, see travel with minimal budget.
The council assumes that travelers do not steal, or transgress, or participate in the illegal market, or beg, or exploit other people for their own gain.
Normally, the first stop after disembarking from a plane, ship, or other vehicle is an immigration checkpoint.
Some cross-border trains are checked while the train is in motion and you must have a valid identity document when you board one.
The driver can collect passports on night trains so as not to interrupt sleep.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process.In some countries, you must register your presence and address with the local authorities.
To do so, you may need to fill out a form with the local police or visit immigration offices.
In many countries with a law like this, local hotels will handle the registration (be sure to ask).
In other cases, only those who do not stay in tourist accommodation must be registered, but this makes the law much more obscure, so it is necessary to find out in advance.
Architecture is the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is usually a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings are beautiful enough to see, and the view from a tall building or from a well-placed window can be a delight.
Architecture coincides significantly with other fields such as urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given the great distance to many of the "pueblos", you won't find much nightlife unless you visit Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, nearly all of the above-mentioned casinos serve drinks, and many of them offer first-class entertainment (especially the larger ones, around Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Be aware: small-town bars around here aren't always a good place for visitors from out of state.
For some reason, northern New Mexico has significant problems with drunk drivers, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high near small town bars.
Graffiti is a form of art that is created without being asked to do so.
While not at all a modern phenomenon, most people associate it with young people vandalizing public and private property using spray paint.
However, today there are renowned artists, graffiti-related events and "legal" walls. Graffiti works in this context often have more artwork than illegible gutters.
Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists look to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that comes back to you, make sure you have one of those boomerangs.
Most boomerangs available in Australia are, in fact, boomerangs that don't come back.
A Hangi meal is cooked inside a hot clot on the ground.
The clot is heated with hot stones from a fire or in some places geothermal heat creates areas of naturally warm earth.
Hangi is often used to cook a roasted meal in the traditional manner.
Many places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other hangi can be taken in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes of suburban trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (Third Class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but is a bit more expensive, though still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
All trains have Metro and MetroPlus cars; MetroPlus cars are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Carrying other people's things - Never lose sight of your bags, especially when crossing international borders.
You can find yourself being used as drug runners without knowing it, which would bring you a whole lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in line, as drug-sniffing dogs could be used at any time without warning.
Some countries have excessively severe punishments even for first offenses; they may involve prison sentences of more than ten years or death.
Unchecked suitcases are a target for thieves and can also draw the attention of cautious authorities with bomb threats.
At home, because of this constant exposure to the local germs, it's very likely that you're already immune to them.
But in places around the world where the bacterial fauna is new to you, you're much more likely to have problems.
Also, in warmer climates, bacteria grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
From here come traveler's diaries such as "the stomach of Delhi", "the curse of the pharaoh", "the revenge of Moctezuma" and many other variants.
As with respiratory problems in cold climates, intestinal problems in warm climates are quite common and in most cases are annoying but not really dangerous.
If you're traveling to a developing country (or a new part of the world) for the first time, don't underestimate the potential for culture shock.
Many seasoned and experienced travelers have been overtaken by the new when traveling to developing countries, where there are many small cultural adjustments that accumulate quickly.
Especially in your first few days, consider spending money on Western-style, quality hotels, food, and services to help you acclimate.
Don't sleep on a mattress or stool in the ground in an area where you don't know the local wildlife.
If you plan to camp outdoors, bring a camping cot or hammock to keep away from snakes, scorpions, and other similar wildlife.
Fill your house with a rich coffee in the morning and a little relaxing chamomile in the evening.
When you're at your vacation home, you have time to enjoy and spend a few extra minutes preparing something special.
If you are feeling adventurous, do not miss the opportunity to squeeze or mix some fruit juices:
Maybe you'll discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast when you return to your usual routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't normally visit.
For those unfamiliar with medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have different meanings.
An infectious disease is one caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacterium, fungus, or other parasite.
A contagious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted when you are near an infected person.
Many governments require that visitors entering or residents leaving their countries be vaccinated for a number of diseases.
Often these requirements depend on the countries the traveler has previously visited or intends to visit.
One of the strengths of Charlotte, North Carolina, is its high number of high-quality options for families.
Residents from other areas often cite family-friendliness as the main reason for moving here, and visitors often find it easy to enjoy the city with children.
In the last 20 years the number of kid-friendly options in Uptown Charlotte has increased exponentially.
Families do not often use taxis in Charlotte, although they may be useful in certain cases.
There is a surcharge for having more than two passengers, so this option can be more expensive than the account.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, and it surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require good fitness, and can only be done in the summer, between November and February, and are very limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
A couple of thousand employees live here during the summer in about four dozen bases mostly in those areas; a small number stay over the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a desolate plateau covered by 2 to 3 km of ice.
Occasionally there are specialized air routes that go inland, to practice mountaineering or to reach the Pole, where there is a very large base.
The South Pole Crossing (or Highway) is a 1,600 km (1,600 mi) trail from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
It is snow compacted with cracks filled and marked with flags, and can only be crossed by specialized tractors, which tow sleds with fuel and supplies.
They are not very agile, so the trail has to make a long journey around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.
The most common causes of accidents in winter are roads, pavements (walkways) and especially slippery steps.
Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are deficient.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material soft enough in cold temperatures.
Some boots have heels and there are accessories with heels for slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes or boots, for the heels or for the sole and heel.
Heels should be low and wide, and roads are often sprayed with sand, gravel, or salt (calcium chloride) to improve traction.
Avalanches are not an extraordinary occurrence; the steep slopes only admit a certain amount of snow, and an excess volume precipitates in the form of avalanches.
The problem is that snow is sticky, so it needs a push to get down, and a little bit of snow that falls can be used as a push for the rest.
Sometimes the triggering event is the sun warming the snow, sometimes it's more snow, sometimes other natural events, often a human.
A tornado is a rotating column of air at very low pressure, which sucks the surrounding air inward and upward.
They generate strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects upwards, carrying them as the tornado moves.
They start as plumes that descend from storm clouds, and become tornadoes when they hit the ground.
Providers of personal VPNs (virtual private networks) are an excellent way to avoid both political censorship and commercial IP geo-filtering.
These are better than web proxies for several reasons: for example, they do not just redirect http but do so with all internet traffic.
They tend to offer higher bandwidth and better service quality, and they're encrypted, so they're harder to spy on.
The media companies lie again and again about the purpose of this action, claiming that it is to "prevent piracy".
In fact, area codes have no effect on illegal copies; a bit-for-bit copy of a disk plays just as well on any device that can play the original.
The current purpose is to offer these companies more control over their markets; it's about making money.
Since calls are routed through the Internet, you do not need to have a telephone company located where you live or where you travel.
You don't need a local number in your community either; you can get a satellite Internet connection in the most desolate areas of Chicken, Alaska and dial a number that says you're under the Arizona sun.
Often, you have to buy a separate global number to allow XTC phones to call you. The origin of the phone number makes a difference to the people who call you.
Real-time text translation applications - applications that can automatically translate fragments of entire text from one language to another.
Some applications within this category can even translate text in foreign languages on signs or other real-world objects when the user directs the smartphone to these objects.
Translation engines have improved dramatically, and nowadays they tend to offer more or less correct translations (and fewer and fewer gibberish), but always be careful, because they can still be wrong.
One of the most prominent applications in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation once the data of the desired language has been downloaded.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone may be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate outside your home country.
You can save money by buying new maps for a GPS or a standalone GPS device or renting one from a rental car company.
If you don't have a data connection for your phone, or if you lack coverage, your performance may be limited or zero.
All grocery stores have a confusing array of prepaid phone cards that can be used for both pay phones and regular phones.
Although most cards are valid for calling anywhere, some specialize in offering convenient calling rates to groups of specific countries.
These services are usually accessed through a toll-free telephone number which can be called from most telephones without having to pay.
The rules about normal photography also apply to video recording, even more so.
If the mere act of taking a picture of something is forbidden, the idea of making a video of it must be put out of your mind.
Before using a drone, make sure you are cleared to record and what additional permits or licenses you need.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in your area.
Nowadays, it is very unusual to book flights directly with the airline, without searching and comparing prices beforehand.
Sometimes the same flight can have very variable prices on different content readers and it pays to compare search results and to take a look at the website of the company itself before booking.
While you may not need a visa for short visits, tourism or business to certain countries, going there as an international student usually requires a longer stay than going there as an occasional tourist.
You usually need to obtain a visa in advance to stay in any foreign country for an extended period.
Student visas usually require different requirements and application procedures than normal tourist or business visas.
For most countries, you need a letter of offer from the institution you want to study at, and also proof of sufficient resources to support yourself for at least your first year of study.
Check the specific requirements with the institution and with the immigration department of the country where you wish to study.
Unless you are a diplomat, working abroad usually involves paying income taxes in the country where you reside.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and tax rates and subsidies vary quite a bit from one country to another.
In some federal countries, as well as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied at both the federal and local levels, so rates and supports may vary from one region to another.
Although immigration control is usually absent or a formality when you return to your home country, customs control can be a nuisance.
Make sure you know what you can and cannot carry, and report anything that exceeds the legal limit.
The easiest way to get started in the travel writing business is to polish your craft on a well-established travel blog.
Once you have become familiar with the format and editing of the website, then you can create your own site.
Volunteering while traveling is a great way to make a difference, but it's not just about giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know a different culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, get a sense of perspective and even gain new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch a budget to be able to extend the stay somewhere, since many volunteer jobs are offered with full pension and some are paid a small salary.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes can still be used. Check possible special permit requirements, which can be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Sea channel links the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea, via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mostly via rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so you can still reach the Caspian Sea through Russia.
You can be sure that once you enter the marina, it will be very obvious, you will meet other boat hitchhikers and they will share their information with you.
Basically, you're going to be putting up ads offering your help, going through the closets, approaching people who are cleaning their yachts, trying to make contact with sailors at the bar, and so on.
Try to talk to as many people as you can, and after a while, everyone will know you and they'll let you know and they'll give you advice like what boat someone's looking for.
You should choose your Frequent Traveler companion carefully in an alliance.
While it may seem logical to join the airline with which you fly most often, it is important to keep in mind that the privileges they offer are often different and that other airlines within the same alliance may give more frequent flyer points.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly increased their services to Africa, and offer connections to most major African cities at more competitive prices than other European companies.
Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries as of 2014.
If you have time to spare for travel, calculate how much it costs you in total to travel to Africa compared with a round-the-world trip.
Don't forget to count the extra expenses of additional visas, travel fees, ground transportation, etc. for all places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world entirely over the southern hemisphere, flight options and destinations are limited by the lack of trans-oceanic routes.
There is no air alliance that crosses all three oceans of the southern hemisphere (and Skyteam does not cover any of the three).
However, Star Alliance covers all but the South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if you want to avoid the South Pacific and the west coast of South America. (See below)
In 1994, the ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan went to war against the Azeris.
With the support of the Armenians, a new republic was created, yet no established nation has officially recognized it - not even Armenia.
Diplomatic discussions over the region continue to undermine the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Grachtengordel in Dutch) is the famous 17th-century neighbourhood surrounding Amsterdam's Binnenstad.
The entire neighborhood has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique historical and cultural value, and the value of its properties is among the highest in the country.
The Cinque Terre, meaning Five Lands, comprise the five coastal towns of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso, located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built rows of houses back to back across the rugged, steep landscape to the cliffs that face the sea.
Part of its charm is the lack of human construction, with roads, trains and boats connecting the villages and cars unable to reach them.
The varieties of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from the French spoken in France, but are sufficiently similar to be mutually intelligible.
Specifically, the numbering system in the French-speaking territories of Belgium and Switzerland has a number of small peculiarities that differentiate it from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of certain words is a bit different.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss would have learned French in school, so they would be able to understand it even if the standard French numbering system was used.
In many parts of the world, a handshake is a friendly gesture that means "hello".
Now, in Malaysia, at least among rural Malays, it means "come here", similar to the gesture of the index finger pointing at the body used in some Western countries, and should only be used for that purpose.
Similarly, a British traveler to Spain may confuse a hand-palm greeting looking at the sender (rather than the person receiving the greeting) with a gesture to go back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created with the aim of facilitating communication between people who otherwise would have communication difficulties.
These are separate from the Franks, which are natural or organic languages that, for various reasons, acquire dominance as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
Travelers can see mirages that generate an illusion of water (or other things) with the daytime heat.
This can be dangerous if the traveler chases the mirage, wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest desert can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk without clothing to shelter.
Especially in the summer, you should be on the lookout for mosquitoes if you decide to make a trek through the rainforest.
Even if you're driving through the subtropical rainforest, a few seconds with the doors open as you enter the vehicle is enough for the mosquitoes to get in with you.
Avian influenza, or more formally avian influenza, can infect birds and mammals.
Fewer than a thousand cases have been reported in humans, but some have been fatal.
In most cases, this is people working with poultry, but there is also a certain risk for bird watchers.
Typical of Norway are the steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a plateau, more or less high.
These plateaus are often called "vides", which means spaces with breadth, open and without trees, that is, an unlimited extension.
In Rogaland and Agder they are often called "hei", which refers to a woodless wasteland often covered with caterpillars.
Glaciers are not stable, but they flow down the mountain, and this will cause cracks, crevices, that can be hidden by snow dams.
It is possible that the walls and ceilings of the ice caves will sink and the crevices may close.
At the edges of glaciers are large blocks that break, fall, and sometimes jump or roll off the edge.
The tourist season of the hill stations usually peaks during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm in winter, when many mountain resorts receive large amounts of snow and offer activities such as skiing or snowboarding.
Few airlines still offer bereavement fares, which slightly reduce the cost of a last-minute funeral trip.
Companies that offer this include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights originating in the US or Canada, and WestJet.
In any case, you must make a reservation by telephone directly with the airline.
