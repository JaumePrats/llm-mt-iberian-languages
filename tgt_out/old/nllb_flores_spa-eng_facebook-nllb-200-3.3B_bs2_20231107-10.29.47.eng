After a spill of thousands of barrels of crude oil in South Fairbanks, 800 miles of the Trans-Alaska pipeline system was shut down.
Crude oil spilled near the Fort Greely 9 pumping station due to the opening of the exhaust valves that were due to a disruption in electrical service, which occurred after a routine test of the fire command system.
When the valves opened, the pressure was released for the system and oil flowed on a platform into a tank that can hold 55,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons).
As of Wednesday afternoon, there were still leaks in the tank's ventilation grids, probably due to thermal expansion inside.
Another secondary containment area located under the tanks, with a capacity of 104 500 barrels, had not been filled to capacity yet.

It is feared that patients may spread the infection by continuing with their daily routines, if mild flu symptoms persist.
Leslie Aun, spokesperson for the Komen Foundation, reported that a new regulation in the organization governs according to which the granting of subsidies or funds in favor of entities that are the subject of official investigation will not proceed.
Komen's policy discredited Planned Parenthood in the wake of an ongoing investigation led by Rep. Cliff Stearns into how this organization reports and uses its funds.
In his role as chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, which sits under the Energy and Commerce Committee umbrella, Stearns is leading an investigation to determine whether taxes are being used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood.
On Tuesday, with more than 46% of the vote, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney won the primary election for Florida Republican Party chairman.
Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, came in second place, with 32 percent of the vote.
Being a winner-take-all state, Florida assigned its fifty delegates to Rommey, propelling him as the leading candidate for the Republican Party nomination.
The organizers of the demonstration claimed that nearly 100,000 people participated in cities across Germany such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hannover.
The police force estimated 6,500 protesters in Berlin.
Demonstrations were also held in Paris; Sofia, Bulgaria; Vilnius, Lithuania; Valetta, Malta; Tallinn, Estonia and Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland.
In London, nearly 200 people demonstrated outside the offices of some of the most important copyright owners.
Last month, major demonstrations took place in Poland when the country signed ACTA, causing the Polish government to decide not to ratify the agreement, for the time being.
Both Latvia and Slovakia have delayed the procedure for joining ACTA.
The Animal Liberation movement and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are again calling for the mandatory installation of video surveillance cameras in all slaughterhouses in Australia.
David O'Shannessy, chief inspector of the RSPCA New South Wales, told ABC that in Australia it should be normal to have slaughterhouses monitored and inspected.
By installing a closed circuit television, a strong message will surely be sent to those who work with animals that their welfare is of paramount priority
The international earthquake map of the US Geological Survey showed no seismic movements in Iceland the week before.
Nor did the Icelandic Meteorological Office report seismic activity in Hekla during the past 48 hours.
The large-scale seismic movements that caused the phase change occurred on March 10, in the northeastern sector of the caldera that is at the summit of this volcano.
Dark clouds were recorded at the base of the mountain that bear no relation to any volcanic activity.
The clouds were a possible cause of confusion as to whether an eruption had actually occurred.
When the breakdown occurred, the Luno was carrying 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board and was swept against the spike by strong winds and waves.
Helicopters rescued all 12 crew members, and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-meter boat was on its way to pick up its usual load of fertilizer, and at first there was concern among officials that some of the cargo might spill.
Both houses approved the proposed amendment in 2011.
During this parliamentary session, a modification was introduced when the House of Representatives removed the second sentence and, subsequently, on Monday, the Senate approved it with a similar wording.
There is a possibility that the removal of the second sentence, which proposes to ban civil unions between individuals of the same sex, will open the way for them in the future.
After the process, HJR-3 will be examined once again to remain in the process during the next legislature, in 2015 or 2016.
Vautier's achievements, apart from his role as director, include a hunger strike in 1973 to fight what he understood to be political censorship.
He began as an activist at the age of 15, joining the French Resistance during World War II.
He wrote an autobiographical book in 1998.
In the 1960s, he returned to Algeria, which had recently achieved its independence, to teach film direction.
Two-time Olympic gold medalist Hitoshi Saito, a judoka from Japan, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was reported to be cancer of the intrahepatic bile ducts.
His death occurred on Tuesday, in Osaka.
At the time of his death, Saito was the director of the training committee of the Japanese Judo Federation, in addition to being an Olympic and world medalist.
No less than 100 guests had attended the party in order to celebrate the couple's first anniversary, whose wedding had taken place a year earlier.
Authorities reported that a formal anniversary event was scheduled for a later date.
The couple had married in Texas a year earlier and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and family.
The husband, a 30-year-old Buffalo native, was one of four people killed in the shooting, but his wife was uninjured.
Karno is a renowned, though controversial, English teacher who taught at Modern Education and King's Glory and claimed to have had 9000 students at the peak of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents thought were rude, and he reportedly used profanity in class.
Modern Education accused him of placing large advertisements on buses without authorization and of lying when he said he was the head English instructor.
He was also accused in the past of violating copyright, but no charges were brought against him.
A former student reported that the man used Lunfardo language in classes, taught skills to use during citations in notes and acted as if he was a friend of the students.
In the last three decades, China has developed a market economy, even though, officially, it continues to have a communist regime.
Under Deng Xiaoping, the first economic reforms were introduced.
From there, China's economic volume has grown 90 times more.
China's car exports surpassed Germany's for the first time and overtook the US as the industry's most important market.
In 20 years, China's GDP could be higher than that of the United States.
Within the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, Danielle is the fourth named tropical storm and originated in the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, has winds reaching a constant maximum speed of 40 mph (64 km/h).
Experts from the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will intensify and trigger a hurricane on Wednesday.
Because the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to analyze the potential impact it will have on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, a native of Zagreb, Croatia's capital, gained popularity when he joined Partizan Belgrade.
In 1945 he joined them and remained there until 1958.
In his time at the club, he scored 403 goals in 468 games.
No other player has made more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
He was elected as the best footballer in the history of Partizan in 1995.
The celebrations began with a special show by the globally famous Cirque du Soleil.
Then the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a group of Janissary and Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses, both singers, performed.
Later, the Whirling Dervishes made their appearance on stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu sang with Alessandro Safina, an Italian tenor, and with the Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
To finish, the Turkish dance group Anatolia performed Troya.
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, died after being involved in an accident at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During his hot road lap, Lenz fell off his bike and was then run over by his teammate, Xavier Zayat.
He received immediate medical attention at the track and was taken to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
The Commission has also proposed that the Council should adopt a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work.
We have been in an economic crisis for a year now, and the last two months have been the worst.
Last week, Naked News publicly announced that it would radically elevate its mandate as the international language for communicating news, to which end it will incorporate three new broadcasts.
This global organization, which already broadcasts news in English and Japanese, is activating programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for TV, Internet and mobile devices.
Luckily, I'm fine, but I witnessed a gruesome scene as people tried to break windows to escape.
Even though people used chairs to smash the glass, the windows were impossible to break.
One survivor, Franciszek Kowal, "reported that one of the glass panes finally broke and they started to escape through the window".
The light and heat emanating from stars are produced when hydrogen atoms combine to form heavier elements.
Scientists are concentrating their efforts on developing a reactor capable of generating energy in the same way.
It is a very difficult problem to solve and it will not be feasible to build useful fusion reactors for many years.
The surface tension causes the needle to remain floating on the water.
Surface tension occurs because water molecules on its surface are attracted much more strongly than air molecules suspended above them.
Water molecules form an invisible film on its surface that allows objects like needles to float on top of it.
The blade of modern ice skates has a two-edged edge separated by a concave space between them, allowing better adhesion to the ice, even when tilted.
Since the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, tilting it to one side or the other will also curve the edge that comes in contact with the ice.
This causes the skater to turn. When the skates tilt to the right, the skater also turns in that direction; if they tilt to the left, it will turn to the left.
To regain their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they received from the light.
It's made by emitting a tiny particle of light called a photon.
Experts call this process "stimulated emission of radiation", since bright light stimulates atoms, resulting in the emission of a photon of light, a type of radiation.
The next image illustrates atoms that emit photons, and of course, these are actually much smaller than the ones in the picture.
The size of photons is even smaller than the matter that makes up atoms!
After running for hundreds of hours, the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and it stops working.
Then the bulb must be changed. Care must be taken in the replacement.
The first thing to do with the lamp is to turn off its switch or disconnect it.
This is because the electricity flowing into the headset where the metal part of the bulb is inserted can cause a severe electrical shock if the inside of that headset or the metal base of the bulb is touched while still partially in the headset.
The heart, which pumps blood, is the most important organ in the circulatory system.
Blood flows from the heart through pathways called arteries and back to the heart through other pathways called veins.
With its teeth, a triceraptops could have crushed not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that Triceratops' diet was based on cycads, a type of plant common in the Cretaceous period.
These plants resemble a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, pointed leaves.
The Triceraptor might have ripped the leaves off with its sturdy horn instead of eating the trunk.
Other scientists say that it is unlikely that dinosaurs ate these plants, since they are highly poisonous. However, today the sloth and other species, such as the parrot (which descended from dinosaurs), can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
If you were on the surface of the satellite, your weight would be less than on Earth.
Someone who weighs 200 pounds on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds on Io, which means, of course, that its gravity exerts less pull.
The sun doesn't have a crust like the earth, where you can stand on it, it's made entirely of gases, fire and plasma.
As it loses proximity to the sun, the gas becomes lighter.
The outer part that can be observed by directing the eye to the sun is called the photosphere; that is, the "sphere of light".
Nearly 3,000 years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei was able to observe through his telescope that Venus had phases, just as the moon has phases.
The phases occur because only the face of Venus (or the moon) facing the sun is illuminated. This phenomenon supported the Copernican theory that the planets orbit the sun.
Later, in 1639, Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, was able to see a transit of Venus.
After recapturing Danelaw, England had enjoyed a prolonged period of peace.
However, in 991, Ethelred fought the largest Viking fleet since Guthrum's fleet of the previous century.
Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian eager to reclaim his nation from Danish rule, was the leader of the fleet.
After facing initial military setbacks, Æthelred managed to reach an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to win his kingdom, with mixed results.
The Korean alphabet is the only deliberately designed alphabet still in popular daily use. It was invented in 1444, during the reign of Sejong (1418-1450).
Sejong was the fourth monarch of the Joseon Dynasty and one of the most respected.
The original name given to the Hangeul alphabet was Hunmin Jeongeum, meaning "the sounds suitable for instructing the people".
There are numerous theories about how Sanskrit came to be, one of which speaks of an Aryan migration from the west to India, who brought the language with them.
The Sanskrit language is ancient, comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book was written in Sanskrit, and after the compilation of the Upanishads, the language simply disappeared, for reasons of hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a complex and rich language that served as a seedbed for many other modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the source of European languages, such as French and Spanish.
At the end of the Battle of France, Germany began planning the invasion of the island of Great Britain.
Germany assigned the attack the code name "Operation Seawolf". The British army was quite weak, having lost most of its heavy weapons and supplies during its evacuation from Dunkirk.
But the Royal Navy was still far stronger than the German (Kriegsmarine) and would have shot down any invading fleet that tried to enter the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the possible invasion routes, as admirals feared that German air attack would sink them.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plans.
Its army and navy were weaker, although four new ships had just been built just before the start of the war.
Italy's primary target was the African countries, and to capture them, it would need a launching pad for troops to sail across the Mediterranean Sea and thus invade Africa.
To do this, they had to get rid of the British bases and ships located in Egypt.
Now, Japan. This is an island country, just like Britain.
Submarines are vessels designed to move and stay underwater for a long period of time.
During World War I and World War II, submarines were used, but they were very slow and their range was very limited.
At the start of the war, they traveled mostly above sea level, but as radar developed and became more accurate, submarines were forced to dive to avoid detection.
The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines.
Given their success with submarines, since the war it does not generate confidence that the Germans own large quantities of these types of ships.
Yes! One of the most well-known kings of ancient Egypt in the modern world is King Tutankhamun, sometimes called "King Tut" or "the boy king".
Interestingly, in ancient times he was not regarded as of much importance and was not recorded in most ancient king lists.
However, he became famous after the discovery of his tomb in 1922, and while many ancient tombs were looted, Tutankhamun's remained almost intact.
Most of the objects that were buried with Tutankhamun have been preserved in good condition, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and exotic stones.
The invention of the radius wheel made the Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better equipped to outrun soldiers and other chariots.
The deadly arrows of crossbows could pierce the armor of enemy soldiers.
A cavalry is a fighting force mounted on horses. At that time, mounts did not yet exist; the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of the horses.
We know of many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists, but perhaps the most famous figure of this culture is Homer, the proverbial blind poet who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature, the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes remained famous playwrights, and their works are considered among the finest in world literature.
Another Greek figure of renown is Pythagoras, a mathematician best known for his famous theorem about the ratio of the sides of right triangles.
Various estimates have been made about the number of Hindi speakers, and it is estimated that it is the second to fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers will differ depending on whether or not closely related dialects are counted.
According to various estimates, between 340 million and 500 million people speak the language and up to 800 million can understand it.
Though similar in vocabulary, Hindi and Urdu differ in spelling, and in everyday conversation, speakers of the two languages can usually understand each other.
German culture had a marked influence in northern Estonia by the 15th century.
To bring the native people closer to God, some monks in Germany invented the literal Estonian language.
Its basis was the German alphabet and a character was incorporated: Õ/ õ.
Over time, many words borrowed from German were fused together, marking the beginning of the Enlightenment.
It is tradition for the future heir to the throne to enlist directly in the army after completing his school education.
Charles nevertheless attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology and, later, history, receiving a 2:2 (a lower second-class degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to obtain a university degree.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia, on the Balkan peninsula) comprises 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is over 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long, 800 kilometres (500 mi) wide, and has a roughly rectangular shape.
Turkey's surface area, including lakes, covers 783,562 square kilometres, of which 755,688 are in southwest Asia and 23,764 in Europe.
Turkey's land area ranks 37th among the largest countries in the world, with a size similar to metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded on three sides by seas - the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Although Luxembourg has a long history, its independence did not occur until 1839.
In the past, the present-day parts of Belgium belonged to Luxembourg, but, after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s, they became Belgian.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral state; however, it was invaded by Germany in both World Wars.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of what is now the European Union.
The Drukgyal Dzong is a deteriorated Buddhist fortification and monastery located north of Paro district, in Phondey Village.
According to the story, in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortification for the purpose of commemorating his triumph against the Tibetan-Mongol army.
The portrait of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal is one of the few relics left from the Drukgyal Dzong, following a fire in 1951.
After the fire, the fort was preserved and given protection, which maintains its place as one of Bhutan's most formidable attractions.
DURING the 18th century, the Kingdom of Cambodia was torn between two powerful neighbors - Thailand and Vietnam.
During the 18th century Cambodia suffered several invasions by the Thais, who, in 1772, destroyed Phnom Phen.
Towards the end of the 18th century, Cambodia also suffered Vietnamese invasions.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed and most of those who are are working in the informal sector.
Two thirds of Venezuelan workers are employed in the service sector, about a quarter work in industry and a fifth in the agricultural sector.
In Venezuela, oil is an important industry, in which the country is a net exporter, although only 1% of its population works in this sector.
After the nation declared its independence, the expertise of the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped transform the island into a tropical garden city.
In 1981, the Singapore orchid, a hybrid crop, was chosen as the national flower.
Every year, around October, about 1.5 million herbivores migrate to the southern plains, crossing the Mara River from the northern hills in search of the rains.
And then they return north by the west, again crossing the Mara River, once the rains have ended, around April.
The Serengeti region is home to the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the Maswa Game Reserve, all in Tanzania.
Learning to develop interactive media involves conventional and traditional skills, as well as mastery of tools in interactive classes (graphic scripting, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to rethink your assumptions about media production and develop nonlinear thinking.
Interactive design requires that the components of a project connect with each other, but at the same time retain their meaning as separate entities.
The downside of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than those required for fixed lenses.
This problem is becoming less important as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in their production.
This has made it possible for zoom lenses to produce photographs of a similar quality to that achieved with fixed focal lenses.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
This makes cheap zoom lenses not easy to use in low light or no flash conditions.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD is over-scan.
The design of most televisions is aimed at pleasing the general public.
This is why all the images you see on television are shown with the top, bottom and side edges cut off.
This is done to ensure that the image is displayed on the full screen.
Unfortunately, when creating a DVD, the edges are very likely to be cropped and, if the video has subtitles near the bottom margin, they won't be seen in full.
The typical medieval castle has long served as an inspiration to the imagination and evokes images of fairs, banquets and Arthurian cavalry.
Even standing in the midst of millennia-old ruins, it is easy to recall the sounds and smells of clashes that occurred long ago; you can almost hear the impact of helmets on the cobblestones and smell the fear rising from the dungeons.
But does our imagination have any anchorage in reality? What was the motive, in the first place, for castles being built? What method was used to design and build them?
The so-called Kirby Muxloe Castle is not such a thing, but rather a fortified house, something typical of that era.
Its large glass windows and thin walls could not have withstood a determined attack for too long.
In the 1480's, when Lord Hastings began building it, the country was fairly peaceful and only needed defense against small bands of wandering outlaws.
The balance of power was a system by which European countries sought to maintain the national sovereignty of each of the states on that continent.
National governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain balance, since they shared the concept that all European nations should strive to prevent only one nation from becoming powerful.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first whose main object was the balance of power.
This marked a major change, since the European powers could no longer use the excuse that the fighting was religious, and the Thirty Years' War would be the last to be called a religious war.
On July 21, 356 B.C.E., the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed in a deliberate fire started by Herostratus.
They say that his motivation was to achieve fame at any cost and that the Ephesians, outraged by this, announced that the name of Herostratus would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later recorded its name, which is what we know today.
Alexander, as king, offered to finance the rebuilding of the temple, but his proposal was rejected.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still playing the notes correctly. Also, try not to make too many strange movements with your fingers.
Keep in mind that unlike the piano, you do not need to press the keys too hard to get more volume.
If you want to raise the volume when playing the accordion, you must use the bellows with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism consists in seeking the link, identity or conscious recognition of a supreme reality, divinity, immaterial truth or God.
The believer's desire is a direct experience, sensation or appreciation of the divine reality, the god or deities.
Its adherents set out to adopt certain lifestyles or practices that aim to nurture those experiences.
Mysticism can be differentiated from other types of religious beliefs and cults by its emphasis on direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, particularly those of a peaceful, sagacious, blissful or even euphoric nature.
Sikhism is a religious sect originating in the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the 15th century in the Punjab region, as a result of a sectarian split within Hinduism.
Sikhs believe that their faith is a religion separate from Hinduism, but they recognize its Hindu origins and traditions.
Gurmat is the name given to the religion by the Sikhs, which in Punjabi means "the path of the guru". The guru is an essential aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism, it has acquired an importance that forms the axis of Sikh beliefs.
Guru Nank (1469-1569) founded the religion in the 15th century and was followed by nine other gurus.
However, in June 1956, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland led by workers protesting food shortages and wage cuts led to widespread demonstrations against communism.
While Khrushchev eventually sent tanks with the aim of restoring order, he at the same time gave way to some of the economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley Civilization developed in the Bronze Age, in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, comprising most of the present-day Pakistan territory and some areas of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the Indus River basin, from which its name is derived.
Despite this, some experts believe that, because the civilization also existed in the basins of the now dry Sarasvati River, it would be more accurate to call it the Indo-Sarasvati civilization; on the other hand, others call it the Harappa civilization, which is the name of the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s.
The martial nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the development of advances in the field of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting physicians who, in fact, formed the first Roman Medical Corps, whose function was to intervene after battles.
Surgeons had knowledge of various sedatives, such as morphine extracted from poppy seeds or scopolamine, obtained from aubergine seeds.
Not only did they become experts in amputation to save gangrene sufferers, but they also made tourniquets and arterial forceps to cut off blood flow.
As the centuries passed, the Roman Empire made great advances in the field of medicine and developed much of the knowledge we have today.
The Pureland type is an origami in which you can only do folds at a time, you can't do those that are more complex, like the reverse ones, and they all have simple locations.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s in order to assist inexperienced folders or those with reduced motor skills.
From a very young age, children develop a certain awareness about race and racial stereotypes and these affect their behaviour.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority and are stereotyped as not doing well in school develop a tendency to fail in school once they become aware of the prejudice linked to their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States, with 54 million users.
These websites have attracted a lot of attention, particularly in the educational field.
There are positive aspects to these websites, such as the possibility to easily set up a virtual classroom that can contain blogs, videos and photos, among others.
This page is easy to access, as it has a single web address, which makes it easy for students who may have problems using the keyboard or spelling to remember and type it.
It is possible to customize it so that it is easy to read and, also, regulate the presence of color, as preferred.
Attention deficit disorder is a neurological syndrome in which, by definition, three symptoms converge: impulsivity, distractibility, and hyperactivity or excess energy.
It is not a learning disability but a learning disorder, affecting 3 to 5 percent of children, possibly as many as 2 million in the United States.
Children with ADD have difficulty concentrating on things such as schoolwork, but they can do so with activities they enjoy, such as playing games, watching their favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble because they "take on risky behaviors, get into fights and defy authority" to stimulate their brain, which cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
ADD affects relationships with other peers, since other children cannot understand why they act the way they do, why they write the way they write, or why they do not share the same level of maturity.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn varied in the way mentioned above, the base rate of knowledge acquisition also changed.
The approach to acquiring knowledge changed, the pressure was no longer on individual memory, but on the ability to remember the text.
Basically, the Renaissance meant a drastic change in the perspective of learning and the transmission of knowledge.
Hominids, in contrast to other apes, no longer use their hands for locomotion or to support weight or swing from tree to tree.
The fact that the hand and foot of the chimpanzee are similar in size and length is evidence that they use the upper limb as support for their weight when walking on their knuckles.
The length of the human hand is shorter than that of the foot and its phalanges are more straight.
Fossil hand bones from two to three million years ago attest to this shift in the use of the hand from locomotion to manipulation.
Some argue that undergoing many sessions of artificially conscious sleep induction can be quite exhausting.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the product of lucid dreams, which extend the time between REM states.
As fewer REMs occur at night, the frequency of this state of actual rest is reduced and the body regains its energy, becoming scarce enough to become a problem.
It's just as exhausting as waking up every 20 minutes or half an hour and watching TV.
The effect will depend on how often your brain tries to produce lucid dreams at night.
Almost from the start, the Italians did not fare well in North Africa, and a week after the country declared war on June 10, 1940, the British Eleventh Hussars had already taken Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
General Lastucci, chief engineer of the Tenth Army of Italy, was captured by the British during an ambush east of Bardia.
Allied fire eliminated, on 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, governor general of Libya, and supposed successor of Mussolini, during his landing in Tobruk.
Modern fencing is practiced at a wide range of levels, from student university fencing to the Olympics and professional competitions.
The main way of practicing this sport is through duels, in which two fencers face each other.
Golf is a sport in which participants attempt to put balls into holes by striking them with a club.
Eighteen holes are contested during a regular round, and players usually start at the top of the field and finish in the 18th.
The winner is the player who achieves the fewest strokes, or stick strokes, to complete the course.
The game is played on grass, and the grass surrounding the hole is cut further and called the green.
Perhaps the most common style of tourism is that most people relate to travel: recreational.
This is the case when travelers choose a destination that is very different from their usual life in order to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks, and campgrounds are often the most popular places for tourists to visit for pleasure.
Cultural tourism is the aim of visiting a particular place to learn about its history and culture.
Tourists can visit different landmarks in a particular country or simply choose to focus on a single area.
Seeing this activity, the colonists had also requested reinforcements.
Reinforcements for the front lines included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments, with 200 soldiers, under the command of Colonels John Stark and James Reed, who later rose to general.
Stark's men deployed along the fence at the northern end of the settler's location.
When the low tide opened a crack along the Mystic River along the northeast peninsula, they quickly extended the siege by building a low stone wall to the north that reached the shores of a small beach.
Gridley or Stark embedded a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and gave the order that no one open fire until the regular army had overrun it.
The basis of the US strategy was the launching of coordinated attacks from three different points.
General John Cadwalder would launch a diversionary attack against the British troops at Bordentown, in order to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing prevented the enemy troops from fleeing by taking the bridge over Assunpink Creek and guiding 700 soldiers across the river at Trenton Ferry.
The larger attack, carried out by 2,400 men, would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, in order to launch an attack before sunrise: one of them under the command of Greene and the other, led by Sullivan.
As the race changes from a quarter to a half mile, speed loses much of its importance, while endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
Already, a top-class half-mile runner, who can exceed two minutes, must have a good level of speed, but must cultivate endurance at all costs.
The way to prepare for the racing season is to combine some cross-country running during the winter season with an upper-body train at the gym.
Proper nutritional practices alone may not generate elite performance, but they can greatly influence the overall well-being of young athletes.
Having an adequate energy balance, adopting effective hydration habits and becoming aware of the different aspects of supplementation practices can help athletes to increase their performance and enjoy sport more.
The middle distance race is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions regarding the limited equipment required to participate.
There are items that can be acquired if deemed necessary; however, most of them will have no real impact on performance, or their impact will be minimal.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even though it does not provide real benefits.
The atom can be considered as one of the cornerstones for the construction of all matter.
It is a very complex structure that is formed, according to the simplified Bohr model, by a central nucleus around which orbit electrons; something similar to the planets that revolve around the Sun.
There are two particles that make up the nucleus; these are the protons and the neutrons.
While neutrons have no electric charge, that of protons is positive and that of electrons is negative.
To examine the victim, you must first inspect the scene for your own safety.
You should observe the position of the victim as you approach him or her, as well as any automatic warning signals.
If you are hurt in trying to help, you may only make matters worse.
The study determined that depression, fear and oversizing were involved in the dynamics between pain and disability in patients with lower back ailments.
Only the effects of catastrophizing, not depression or fear, were conditioned by structured, weekly, regular AF sessions.
Those who engaged in regular activities required more support for negative pain perception, highlighting the distinctions between chronic pain and the feeling of discomfort present in habitual physical movement.
Sight, or the ability to see, is in charge of the sensory organs (eyes) of the visual system.
There are many different eye structures; their complexity varies according to the needs of the organism.
Different constructs have different capabilities, are susceptible to having different lengths and degrees of sharpness; also require differential processing to make sense of the input and dissimilar numbers to make them work optimally.
A population is the collection of organisms of a particular species within a specific geographical area.
When individuals in a population share some particular phenotypic trait identically, they are called monomorphic.
Those who exhibit several variants of the same trait are called polymorphic.
Colonies of warrior ants also walk and nest in different phases.
During the nomadic stage, the war ants move forward at night and stop to camp during the day.
The colony enters a nomadic phase when the available food is reduced, during which they form temporary nests that are changed daily.
Each of these wandering marches lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The term comes from the Latin word cella, meaning "small room", and was first used by a microscopist while studying the structure of cork.
The basic unit of all living things is the cell, and every organism is made up of one or more of them.
Cells are basic and crucial to the study of life, in fact they are often called the building blocks of life.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis through nerve impulses that it sends throughout the body so that blood flow runs uninterrupted.
These nerve impulses can be sent quickly through the body, helping to keep you safe from any potential threats.
While the areas tornadoes strike are small, compared to other aggressive storms, they can destroy everything in their path.
Tornadoes uproot trees, rip panels off buildings and toss vehicles into the sky.
These colossal storms bring gusts of up to 300 mph.
For millennia and millennia people have made and used magnifying lenses.
However, the first true telescopes were developed in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us and the essence of cooperation is that, when the majority benefits, there will always be more to gain in the short term if you act selfishly.
Fortunately, most people realize that their best option in the long run is to work collaboratively with others.
Many people dream of the day when humans will travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some wonder what is out there, others believe that other planets may be inhabited by extraterrestrials or other life forms.
But if this were to happen, it probably wouldn't last long, because the stars are so scattered that there are trillions of miles between them that they're "neighbors".
Will your great-grandchildren, perhaps, one day be on top of an alien world asking questions about their old ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells, they ingest food and digest it inside, and most of them can move.
Animals are the only ones that have brains, but not all of them; jellyfish, for example, do not.
Animals can be found in every corner of the planet - they dig in the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the skies.
The cell is defined as the smallest structural and functional unit that makes up a living organism (thing).
The term cell is derived from the Latin word cella, meaning "small room".
If you examine a living thing under a microscope, you will notice that they are made up of small squares or spheres.
Analyzing a cork under a microscope, English biologist Robert Hooke observed tiny squares in its structure.
He was the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds are able to change state without being altered.
In its gaseous state, nitrogen retains the same properties as in its liquid state. Although in the second case it is denser, the molecules still do not change.
Another example is water, which is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether in a liquid, solid or gaseous state.
Although his physical state may vary, the chemical remains the same.
Time is a pervasive thing that affects all our actions, yet it is difficult to understand.
Religious scholars, philosophers, and scientists have studied time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that pass from the future through the present to the past.
Time is also the way in which we compare the duration (extension) of events.
It is possible for you to mark the passage of time for yourself by observing how a cyclical event repeats; that is, something that occurs again and again on a regular basis.
Today, people use computers to manipulate images and videos.
Sophisticated computer animation is possible, something that is increasingly common in both television and film.
Often, music recording is done with sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds.
For many years during the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the original inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted huge birds called moas.
Later, the theory established the idea that the Maori people had migrated from Polynesia aboard a Great Fleet, and that they dispossessed the Moriori of New Zealand, establishing an agricultural society there.
New evidence suggests, however, that the Moriori were a group of mainland Maori who left New Zealand and headed for the Chatham Islands, where they developed their distinctive peaceful culture.
Another tribe, the Maori, left New Zealand and settled in the Chatham Islands.
They named themselves Moriori, then there was some fighting and finally they were eliminated.
Those who were part of it for several decades helped us to appreciate our strengths and dedication, while honestly assessing the difficulties and even the failures.
As we listened to others tell their personal stories, their families and their organizational forms, we gathered useful information about the past and about some of the personalities who had an impact, whether positive or negative, on the organizational culture.
While knowing personal stories does not imply understanding the culture, it does at least help individuals to be able to represent their place within the history of the organization.
During the process of analyzing successes and becoming aware of failures, the individuals and groups of people involved discover more deeply the values, purpose and forces that drive the organization.
Here, remembering previous instances of business behavior, and the successes gained from them, helped get people open to new changes and directions for the local church.
These success stories alleviated the fears of change and created positive inclinations for change in the future.
Convergent thinking patterns are methods for solving problems that link different ideas or fields, in search of a solution.
The central aspect of this way of thinking is speed, logic and accuracy, as well as the identification of factual issues through the reuse of existing techniques and the collection of data.
This kind of thinking has as its main premise the existence of only one right answer. It is thought in terms of two possible answers, one right and one wrong.
This kind of thinking relates to certain sciences or standardized procedures.
People who think this way have logical thinking, they can remember patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
Human beings are by far the most talented species at reading the minds of others.
This implies that we have the ability to make accurate predictions about other people's perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge and desires.
Among these abilities, understanding the intent of others is crucial, as it allows us to resolve possible ambiguities in physical actions.
For example, if you saw someone break a car window, you would probably assume that he was trying to steal someone else's vehicle.
You would judge him differently if he had lost the keys to his own car and it was his car he was trying to break into.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930's by Felix Bloch (who worked for Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (of Harvard University).
During this resonance, the magnetic field and the radio waves cause the atoms to emit tiny radio signals.
It was a physician and scientific researcher named Raymond Damadian who, in 1970, discovered the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as an instrument for making medical diagnoses.
After four years he was granted a patent, the first to be issued worldwide relating to magnetic resonance imaging.
In 1997, Dr. Damadian finished building the first "whole-body" MRI scanner, which he named the "Indomitable".
Asynchronous communication encourages taking time to reflect and react in front of others.
It allows learners to work at their own pace and control the pace of instructional information.
There are also fewer time constraints, allowing for flexible working hours (Bremer, 1998).
The use of the Internet and the world wide computer network allows students to have access to information at all times.
Students can also send inquiries to instructors at any time of the day and receive a reasonably agile response, rather than waiting until the next in-person meeting.
The postmodern approach to learning involves liberation from absolutes; there is no one right way to learn.
Indeed, there is no single thing that is good to learn. Learning occurs through the interaction between the knowledge presented and the one who absorbs it.
To illustrate this point, we can just refer to our current experience with all the TV shows that focus on learning, and DIY and presentation of information.
Many of us have found ourselves watching television programs that provide information about processes or experiences in which we will never have a part or apply that knowledge.
We will never repair a vehicle, build a fountain in our backyard, go to Peru to examine ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbor's house.
Undersea fibre-optic cable connections reaching Europe and broadband satellite make it possible for Greenland to have good connectivity and for 93% of the population to have access to the Internet.
Your hotel or hosts (if you stay in a guest house or in a private home) will probably have wifi or a computer connected to the internet and every village has a café with internet or somewhere with public wifi.
As noted above, while the word esquimal is still accepted in the United States, many non-US Arctic communities consider it offensive, particularly in Canada.
Although there is a chance that you will hear the term from the mouths of Greenlanders, those from other countries should avoid using it.
In Canada, the native residents of Greenland call themselves Inuit and, in Greenland, kalaalleq (plural of kalaallit); that is, Greenlanders.
Crime and xenophobia in general are virtually nil in Greenland, and there are no "hot spots" even in the cities.
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger that may be faced by those who are not prepared.
If you visit Greenland in the cold seasons (considering that the further north you go, the lower the temperature), it is crucial to bring enough warm clothing.
Long summer days can make it difficult to get enough sleep and cause other related health problems.
During the summer, you also need to protect yourself from northern mosquitoes, which, although they do not transmit any disease, can be very annoying.
Although San Francisco's economy is related to its status as a global tourist attraction, it is diverse.
The most prominent labour industries are professional services, state employment, finance, commercial activities and tourism.
The city's frequent appearance in songs, movies, literature, and popular culture has helped make it and its monuments world famous.
With a wide variety of top-notch hotels, restaurants, and convention facilities, San Francisco has developed a great tourist infrastructure.
San Francisco is also one of the best cities in the United States to find other Asian cuisines, such as Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
The trip to Walt Disney World is, for many families in the United States, a great pilgrimage.
The typical visit involves flying to Orlando International Airport, taking a bus to a hotel within the Disney complex, staying in the area for about a week, and returning home.
There are infinite possible variations, but this is still what most people mean when they talk about "going to Disneyland".
Many of the passes available online, on auction websites like eBay or Craigslist, are partially used, multi-day Park Hopper tickets.
Although it is a very common practice, Disney is prohibited: passes are not transferable.
A crossing permit is required to camp below the rim of the Grand Canyon.
In order to protect the canyon, a limited number of permits are issued, which can be requested only on the first day of each month, only from the four months prior to the start.
Therefore, transit permits for any start date within the month of May will be available as of 1 January.
Usually, the space for the most visited areas, such as the Bright Angel Campground, which is next to Phantom Ranch, is filled with requests that arrive on the first available date to make reservations.
There is a limited number of permits, reserved for applications without prior shift, which are issued in order of arrival.
A fantastic way to see all the charm of the southern African region is by car, which in turn will allow you to access places off the usual tourist routes.
This can be done in a common car with careful planning, but it is most advisable to do it in a 4x4; in addition, there are many places that can only be accessed with a 4x4 with wide wheelbase.
When planning your trip, keep in mind that, although South Africa is stable, not all the countries around it are.
The requirements and costs for obtaining a visa depend on the country you are from and also vary from country to country.
In addition, each country has its own laws that determine what emergency items must be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in western Zimbabwe, across the border from Livingstone, Zambia, and close to Botswana.
The city is located next to the waterfalls, which are its main attraction, but this well-known tourist destination also offers, both adventurers and travelers, a large number of options for a longer stay.
During the rainy season (November to March), the water flow will increase and the falls will be more impressive.
You can be sure that you will get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the winding paths near the falls.
Moreover, it is precisely because of the high volume of water that your view of the actual falls will be obstructed by all the water!
Tutankhamun's tomb (KV62) - The tomb KV62 may be considered the most famous in the Valley of the Kings, the scene of Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of the young pharaoh's nearly intact royal burial.
However, compared with most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun's is hardly worth visiting, since it is much smaller and sparsely decorated.
Anyone interested in observing the damage done to the mummy during attempts to remove it from the coffin would be disappointed, since only the head and shoulders are visible.
Today, the tomb's jewels are not there, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
For visitors with little time, it would be convenient to invest it elsewhere.
Phnom Krom is a temple built on a hilltop in the late 9th century during the reign of King Yasovarman, 12 km south of Siem Reap.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view of the Tonle Sap Lake make the hill climb worthwhile.
A combination of a site visit and a boat trip to the lake can be arranged.
You need the Angkor Pass to access the temple, so don't forget your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.
Although Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, most other states and the United Nations do not recognize it as such.
The legendary city in the Judean Hills has an incredible thousand-year history.
The three monotheistic cults; that is, Jews, Christians and Muslims, consider it holy land and functions as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Because of the religious significance of the city and especially the number of sites in the Old City that are still standing today, Jerusalem is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Israel.
There are many historical, archaeological, and cultural sites in Jerusalem, as well as vibrant and busy shopping centers, bars, and restaurants.
In the case of citizens from Cuba, Ecuador requires that they have been given an invitation letter before entering the country through international airports or border checkpoints.
This letter must be legalised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and meet certain requirements.
The purpose of these requirements is to provide for an organised migration flow between both countries.
Those from Cuba with a U.S. green card must present themselves to an Ecuadorian consulate to be granted exemption from this requirement.
The validity of your passport is required to be at least 6 months longer than the date of your travel, and you must have a return ticket to prove the length of your stay.
Excursions are cheaper for larger groups, so if you are alone or with a single friend, try to meet people and form a group of four to six to get a better rate for each.
However, you should not worry about this as tourists often mix with each other to complete the cars.
Actually, it seems more like a way to trick people into thinking you have to pay more.
Spread out at the northern end of Machu Picchu, this steep-sided mountain is often the backdrop of many photographs of the ruins.
From below it is a bit overwhelming, the climb has a steep incline and is complicated, but most people with reasonable physical condition should be able to complete it in about 45 minutes.
The stone steps run almost the entire length of the road, and in the steepest parts, steel cables provide a supporting handrail.
Be prepared for lack of air, however, and be careful in the steepest parts, especially when they are wet, as they can become dangerous quickly.
At the top is a small cave through which you have to pass.
A boat is the best way to see the sights and wildlife of the Galapagos, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships sail the Galapagos waters, with capacities varying from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place well in advance, as the boats are usually full in high season.
Make sure that the agent you book with has specialized knowledge of the Galapagos and the wide variety of ships in that destination.
This will ensure that your personal preferences or limitations match the boat that best suits them.
Until the 16th century, during the Pre-Hippo era, the north of Chile was dominated by the Incas, while the indigenous Araucanians (Mapuches) resided in the center and south of the country.
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent American tribes, which were not completely absorbed by the dominance of the Spanish language, but only after the independence of Chile.
Although Chile's independence was declared in 1810 (a time when, as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, Spain was left without an operational central government for some years), the decisive triumph against the Spanish did not occur until 1818.
The Dominican Republic is a Caribbean country occupying the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to its white-sand beaches and mountain scenery, the country is home to the oldest European city in the Americas, now part of Santo Domingo.
The first inhabitants of the island were the Taíno and Carib; the latter, who spoke the Arawakan language, had arrived on the island around 10,000 BC.
A few years after the arrival of European explorers, Spanish conquistadors reduced the Taíno population significantly.
According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Treaty of the Indies), Spanish settlers murdered about 100,000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498.
This place was built as an atrium for a 17th-century convent, of which only the building of the San Diego Temple is preserved.
Now it functions as the central square, where things always happen, both day and night.
The garden is surrounded by several restaurants and, in the afternoons and evenings, free concerts are usually offered from the central gazebo.
The Kissing Alley: Two balconies separated by only 69 cm is home to an ancient romantic legend.
Some children will tell a story in exchange for a small tip.
Bowen Island is a well-known day trip or weekend getaway that includes kayaking, hiking, shopping, restaurants and more.
In Howe Sound, right next to Vancouver, you'll find this authentic community that's easily accessible by scheduled water taxis that leave from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who enjoy outdoor activities, a trip along the Sea to Sky corridor is a must.
Whistler, which is an hour and a half drive from Vancouver, is expensive but known for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
During the winter, enjoy some of the best skiing in North America, and in the summer, experience authentic mountain biking.
You must book your permit in advance, and to stay overnight in Sirena, you must have a permit.
The only ranger station that offers rooming and hot food outside of camp is Sirena, not so in La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos, where they only offer camping, no food service.
While parking permits can be reserved directly from the park ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, credit card payments are not possible.
The National Park Service (MINAE) does not issue entry permits more than one month in advance of the expected arrival date.
CafeNet El Sol provides a reservation service for a fee of US$ 30 or $10 for daily passes; more details, on the Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands, in Polynesia, Pacific Ocean, is an island state in voluntary association with New Zealand.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands spread over an ocean area of 2.2 million km2.
Because it shares the same time zone as Hawaii, these islands are sometimes referred to as "Hawaii Down Under".
While smaller, some senior visitors are reminded of Hawaii, before it became a state and all the big resort hotels and other developments existed.
Although the Cook Islands are uninhabited, they are made up of 15 islands, the largest of which are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Today, luxury bed and breakfast has become an art form in the first world countries.
In the best category, the competition between B&Bs is, of course, in two services: bedding and breakfast.
Thus, in the most exclusive of such establishments, one may find the most luxurious bedding, perhaps a handmade bedspread or an antique bed.
For breakfast, you can serve seasonal delicacies from the region or the host's specialty.
The setting could be a historic building with antique furniture, immaculate gardens, or a swimming pool.
Getting into your own vehicle and embarking on an extended journey overland has an intrinsic appeal in its simplicity.
Unlike larger cars, you are likely already familiar with the operation of your tire and are aware of its limitations.
Raising a tent on private land or in a village no matter how small can easily attract unwanted attention.
To sum up, it is a great option to take a road trip in your own car, but very rarely will it serve you as a form of camping.
Those with a spacious minivan, SUV, sedan, or pickup with reclining seats can camp in their vehicle.
Some hotels are owners of a legacy from the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners, dating back to before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th centuries.
These hotels were the lodgings of the rich and famous of the day, and they often provided fine dining and nightlife.
Out-of-fashion accessories, lack of the most up-to-date amenities and a certain sophisticated antiquity are also part of its temperament.
Although usually privately owned, they occasionally house visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.
A very wealthy traveler might consider taking a trip around the world, splitting it up into stays at many of these hotels.
A network of accommodation exchanges is an organisation that connects travellers with residents of the destinations they will visit.
Joining such a network usually requires completing an online form, although some networks offer or require additional verification.
A list of available hosts is then provided, either in print or online, sometimes with references and comments from other travelers.
Couchsurfing began in January 2004, after a computer programmer named Casey Fenton got a low-cost flight to Iceland, but couldn't find a place to stay.
He emailed students from the local university and received a bunch of free housing offers.
Hostels usually host young people (the average guest is in his/her twenties), but older travellers can often be found.
Families with children are not often seen, but some hostels accept them in private rooms.
The Chinese city of Beijing will host the Winter Olympic Games in 2022, becoming the first city to host both the summer and winter competitions.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the indoor ice events.
At the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 km (140 mi) from Beijing, other events in the sport will take place.
Most temples hold an annual festival whose beginning can take place between November and mid-May, depending on the annual calendar of each temple.
Most festivals at the temple are celebrated as part of the temple's anniversary or the birthday of the reigning deity, or any other important event that relates to the temple.
A regular procession of ornate elephants, the temple orchestra, and other festivities make the festivals at the Kerela temple very alluring.
A World's Fair (usually called a World's Fair, or simply an Expo) is a large-scale international festival where arts and sciences converge.
Participating countries display their artistic and educational exhibits in national pavilions, either to illustrate world issues or the history and culture of the country.
International horticultural events are specialized gatherings where floral arrangements, botanical gardens and everything related to plants are exhibited.
Although in theory they are held once a year (if in different countries), this is not the case in practice.
These events usually last from three to six months and are held on premises of no less than 50 hectares.
Over the years, many film formats have been used, the standard 35 mm (36 by 24 mm negative) being the most common.
In general, it can be easily replaced if it runs out and offers a resolution similar to that of the current DSLR.
There are medium format film cameras that use a 6 by 6 cm, more specifically, a 56 by 56 mm negative.
This allows almost four times the resolution as with a 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 vs. 864).
One of the most challenging subjects for photographers is wildlife, and they need a combination of good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photography is often undervalued, but as with all wildlife photography, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Typically, wildlife photography requires a long telephoto lens, although other lenses are required for targets such as a flock of birds or a very small creature.
Many exotic species are difficult to find and it is common for parks to impose restrictions on commercial photography.
There are shy wild creatures and aggressive ones, and the environment can be cold, warm, or hostile.
Worldwide, there are over 5,000 distinct languages, of which over 20 are spoken by 50 million people or more.
In general, written communication is easier to understand than spoken communication, as is the case with addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce in a way that is understandable.
A large number of entire countries speak English fluently and in many more one can expect to find some knowledge of the language, particularly among the younger generation.
Imagine, for example, a Mancunian, a Bostonian, a Jamaican and a Sydney citizen sitting at a table sharing a meal in a Toronto restaurant.
They delight each other with stories from their hometowns, told in their different accents and local slang.
The cheapest way to eat is usually to buy food from supermarkets, but if cooking is not possible, the options are reduced to ready-made foods.
Supermarkets are increasingly serving a variety of prepared foods, some even offering a microwave or other means of heating food.
In some countries or types of shops, there is at least one restaurant within the venue, which is usually quite informal and its prices, economical.
Make copies of your policy and take them with you, along with the contact information for your insurance company.
For advice or authorisation and for claims, you should show the insurance company's e-mail address and international telephone numbers.
Keep another copy in your suitcase and a digital copy (email it as an attachment or upload it to the cloud).
If you travel with a laptop or tablet, keep a copy on a hard drive or on a memory card that you can access without Internet access.
Also give copies of the policy and contact details to those with whom you are travelling and to family or friends in your country who are willing to help you.
Moose (also called elk) are not aggressive in nature, but will defend themselves if threatened.
If individuals do not perceive that moose are potentially aggressive, they may approach them too closely and put themselves in danger.
Drink in moderation. Alcohol affects each person differently, and knowing your own limits is extremely important.
Excessive alcohol intake can cause chronic health problems such as liver damage and even blindness and death. The potential danger is increased by the consumption of illegally made alcohol.
Illegal alcoholic beverages may contain several threatening impurities, such as methanol, which can cause blindness or even death, even in small amounts.
Lenses may be cheaper in a foreign country, particularly in those with low incomes where labor costs are lower.
Consider the option of having an eye examination in your home country, whether it is covered by insurance, and then taking the prescription with you to present it in any other destination in the world.
High-quality branded saddles that can be purchased in that area may have two drawbacks: some may be imitations and authentic imported ones may be more expensive than in the country of origin.
Coffee is one of the most widely traded commodities in the world and you are likely to find many varieties in its region of origin.
However, there are many different ways of drinking coffee around the globe, and they are worth trying.
Canyoning involves going to the bottom of a canyon that is either dry or filled with water.
While canyoning contains elements of both swimming, climbing, and jumping, it is a sport that requires relatively little training or fitness for those who begin it (compared, for example, with rock climbing, diving, or alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that involves walking through natural environments, often along purpose-built paths.
Day walks involve distances from less than a mile to longer journeys, which can be covered in a day.
A day's hike on a simple trail requires little preparation and can be done by anyone in moderate shape.
While family groups with young children may require more preparation, even with infants and preschool children, a day outdoors is simple.
Worldwide, there are about 200 corridor tourism organisations, most of which operate independently.
Go! Running Tours, the successor to Global Running Tours, connects dozens of running tour providers on four continents.
Originating from Running Tours Barcelona, from that city, and Running Copenhagen, from this other, it was quickly joined by Prague-based Running Tours Prague and others.
There are many things to consider before and when traveling to a destination.
When travelling, be prepared for things to be different from 'home'.There will be differences in things like manners, legislation, food, traffic, accommodation, rules, language, and more.
This should be kept in mind to avoid disappointments and even displeasure with local ways of doing things.
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good choice for cases where the traveller has no previous experience in such matters as nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
While most agencies are willing to take on almost all types of traditional bookings, many agents specialize in certain types of trips, budget ranges or specific destinations.
It may be better to contact an agent who makes frequent bookings for trips similar to yours.
You can check the travels promoted by the agent on a website or in a shop window.
If you have a desire to see the world at a low cost, whether out of necessity, lifestyle or as a challenge, there are a few ways to do it.
Essentially, there are two classes of travelers - those who work while traveling and those who seek to restrict their spending.
Those who are willing to relegate comfort, time and predictability in order to reduce costs to virtually zero find out by traveling on a minimal budget.
The recommendation assumes that travelers do not steal, violate private property, participate in the illegal market, beg, or otherwise exploit others for their own benefit.
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop when disembarking from an aircraft, ship, or other means of transport.
On certain cross-border railways, checks are carried out inside the moving train, so you should have a valid ID when boarding one.
On night trains, the driver can collect passports so as not to interrupt his rest.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process.In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
This may require you to fill out a form with the local police or to go to the immigration office.
In many countries where such laws exist, local hotels will arrange for registration (do not forget to check).
In other cases, only those staying outside tourist accommodation need to register, but this makes the law much more uncertain, so make inquiries in advance.
In charge of the design and construction of buildings, the architecture of a site is often a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings are truly beautiful to behold, and the landscape from those of high height or with strategically placed windows can be a beauty worth contemplating.
Architecture has numerous points of encounter with other disciplines, including urban planning, civil engineering, decorative art, interior design, and landscape design.
Given the remoteness of many of the towns, you won't find much nightlife unless you travel as far as Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
Still, most of the above-mentioned casinos serve drinks and several of them offer renowned shows (primarily the larger ones, located around Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Warning: the small-town bars of this place are not always a good choice for the traveler from another country to hang out.
For starters, northern New Mexico has a serious problem with drunk drivers and their concentration is high in the vicinity of small bars in the city.
Unwanted graffiti is called graffiti.
Although far from a modern phenomenon, most people generally associate it with vandalism of public and private property by young people using spray paint.
However, there are now well-known graffiti artists, graffiti events and 'legal walls' and graffiti paintings can often be seen as works of art rather than illegible labels.
Many tourists wish to master the art of boomerang throwing.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang and have it return to your hand, make sure you have one that is suitable for return.
In fact, most boomerangs available in Australia do not return to the place from which they are thrown, so it is advisable for beginners not to attempt to throw them if it is windy.
A typical Hangi dish is prepared inside a hot hole made in the ground.
The pit is heated with hot stones extracted from the fire or, in some places, geothermal heat causes certain areas of the ground to warm up naturally.
Hange is used a lot in order to prepare a dinner with a traditional roasting style.
A few sites in Rotorua have geothermal hangi, while others can be tried in Christchurch, Wellington, and others.
MetroRail has two types of suburban railways in Cape Town and surrounding areas: MetroPlus (also known as First Class) and Metro (called Third Class).
MetroPlus offers more comfort and less crowding, although it is a bit more expensive.
Each railway has MetroPlus and Metro cars; the former are always located at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Carrying belongings: Keep your luggage in view, especially when crossing international borders.
You could find yourself being used as a psychotropic drug carrier without even knowing it, which would bring you a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in line, as drug dogs can be used at any time without warning.
Some countries impose excessively draconian punishments, with sentences of up to 10 years or death, even for first-time offenders.
Neglected luggage becomes a target for robberies and at the same time attracts the attention of authorities, who are alert to possible bomb threats.
In your home country, as a result of this constant exposure to local germs, you are almost certainly already immune to them.
However, in other parts of the world where, where you are not familiar with the bacteriological fauna, there are great chances that problems will arise.
Also, in climates with higher temperatures, bacteria develop more quickly and manage to live longer outside the body.
From there came the scourges of Delhi Belly, the curse of the Pharaoh and the vendetta of Monteczuma and his manyss friends.
In the same way as respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal conditions in warmer climates are quite common and, while undoubtedly annoying, in most cases are not actually dangerous.
Whether it's your first trip to a developing country or a place you've never been before, don't underestimate the potential cultural impact.
More than one stable and capable traveler has been overtaken by the novelties involved in travel to developing countries, where many small cultural adjustments can quickly accumulate.
Especially during the first few days, consider spending a good amount of money on good quality, Western-style hotels, food, and services.
It is advisable not to sleep on a mattress or a mattress on the floor in areas where you are not familiar with the local fauna.
If you are going camping, bring a cot or hammock to keep away snakes, scorpions, and the like.
Fill your home with a delicious cup of coffee in the morning and a relaxing cup of chamomile tea in the evening.
When you are on vacation at home, you have time to enjoy yourself and take a few extra minutes to cook a special dish.
If you are encouraged to experience a greater adventure, take the opportunity to drink juice or mix some of the shakes:
You may find a breakfast drink easy to prepare for when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture, visit bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't usually go to.
For those who are unfamiliar with medical terminology, "infectious" and "contagious" are not the same.
An infectious disease is one caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacteria, fungus or other parasitic organism.
A contagious disease is one that is easily transmitted by being in close contact with an infected person.
Authorities in many countries require vaccination against various diseases for travellers entering or residents leaving.
These requirements often depend on the countries visited or intended to be visited.
One of the main advantages of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it offers a good number of quality options for families.
Residents from other regions often cite good family life as the primary reason for moving there, and many times visitors find it easy to enjoy the city with children around.
The variety of options designed for Uptown Charlotte kids has grown exponentially over the past 20 years.
In Charlotte, it's not common for families to take taxis, but they can be of some use in certain situations.
A surcharge applies if there are more than two passengers, so this option could be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require good physical condition, can only be done in the summer from November to February and are mostly restricted to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
A couple of thousand employees live here in the summer, on about four dozen bases, mostly located in those regions, but only a small number remain during the winter.
Inside, Antarctica consists of a desert plateau covered by two to three kilometers of ice.
Occasionally, specialized air excursions are made that go deep into the mountains to practice mountaineering or to the Pole, where there is a large base.
The McMurdo to the South Pole Highway (or Highway) is a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) road from the McMurdo base on the Ross Sea to the South Pole.
The snow is compacted, with cracks filled in and marked with flags, and only special tractors can move through it, carrying sledges loaded with fuel or other supplies.
These are not very agile, so the road must make a long turn around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau.
In winter, the most common causes of accidents are road accidents, approaches and, in particular, slippery steps.
It is essential that you have at least shoes with proper soles.Summer shoes usually slip a lot on ice and snow, even winter boots are not suitable.
The pattern must be of an appropriate depth, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material must be sufficiently soft at low temperatures.
There are heel boots and there is an additional heel accessory for slippery conditions, which fits almost any footwear, both for heels and sole.
Sand, gravel, or salt (calcium chloride) is often sprinkled on roads or paths to improve grip.
Avalanches are not unusual; steep slopes can only withstand a certain amount of snow, so the excess will fall as avalanches.
The problem is that snow is sticky, which is why it requires some activation to fall, and that falling can be the trigger for the rest.
Sometimes the factor that triggers them is the sun melting the snow, other times it's a new snowfall or other natural events, and often, it's the human being.
A tornado is a rotating cylinder of very low-pressure air that sucks in and up the air around it.
They produce large winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them with them as the tornado moves.
They start as funnels that come down from storm clouds and turn into tornadoes when they hit the ground.
Providers of personal VPNs are the ideal choice to avoid political censorship and geofiltering of commercial IP.
They are superior to proxy servers for several reasons: they redirect all Internet traffic and not just http.
They generally provide higher bandwidth and better quality of service, are encrypted, and because of that, are more difficult to hack.
Media companies repeatedly lie about their purpose, claiming that it serves to "prevent piracy".
The region codes have no effect on unlawful copying: an identical replica of a disc will be played without problems on the same devices as the original.
The hidden objective that these companies have in mind is to gain more control over their markets; it's about making money circulate.
Since calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use a cell-phone company located in your area or in the destination where you are going.
Nor is it required that you get a local number from where you live; you can use a satellite Internet connection in the wilderness of Chicken, Alaska, and dial a number that says you are in sunny Arizona.
Often, a separate global number must be purchased to allow you to be called from PSTN phones. Where that number comes from makes a difference to those who call it.
Instant translation applications: are those that can generate, in an automatic way, translations of complete segments of text from one language to another.
Among these types of applications, we can find some that even translate into foreign languages the texts of posters or other objects in the real world if the user focuses his smartphone on such objects.
Translation engines have improved dramatically and now often provide fairly accurate translations (and rarely meaningless content); however, some caution should be taken, as they may still fail.
One of the main applications in this category is Google Translate, which performs offline translation if you download the data of the language you will be working with.
Possibly the simplest and most convenient way to navigate while abroad is to install GPS navigation apps on your smartphone.
You can save money by buying new GPS maps, a standalone GPS device, or also rent one from any car rental agency.
If you don't have a data connection for your phone or when it's out of range, it may have reduced performance or it may not work.
In the shops around every corner there is a huge and confusing variety of prepaid telephone cards that can be used on public or common telephones.
While almost all cards are good for calling anywhere, some offer favorable rates to groups of specific countries.
These services are usually available through a freephone number which can be reached from most telephones free of charge.
The rules of regular photography also apply to video recording, possibly even more so.
If you're not allowed to take a picture of something, then you shouldn't even think about filming it.
If a drone is used, it should be checked beforehand what can be filmed and what extra permits or licenses are needed.
Even if it is legal in your area, it is usually not a good idea to fly a drone in the vicinity of an airport or over a crowd.
At present, air travel is rarely booked directly with the airline, without first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the same flight can cost very different prices on several content aggregators, so it's worth comparing search results and browsing the company's website before booking.
While you may not need a visa for short stays in certain destinations if you are travelling as a tourist or on business, travelling to those same places as an international student usually involves a longer stay than an occasional tourist visit.
In general, to stay in any foreign country for a long period of time, you will need to obtain a visa in advance.
Student visas generally involve different requirements and application procedures than those for normal tourist or business visas.
In most countries you will be required to have a letter of offer from the institution where you intend to study and to prove that you have funds to support yourself for at least the first year of the course.
Check with the institution and immigration office where you intend to study to find out more about the requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, having a job abroad means that you have to declare income tax in your country of residence.
Income tax is organised differently in the different states and the tax rates and categories differ greatly between countries.
There are federal states, such as the United States and Canada, where income tax is governed at both the federal and local levels.
Although there is usually no immigration control, it is only a formality, when you arrive in your country of origin, customs control can be a nuisance.
Make sure that you are clear about what items you can and cannot bring in, and declare any items that exceed the legal limits.
The easiest way to get started in the travel writing business is to hone your skills on an established travel blogging website.
Once you have become familiar with formatting and web editing, you may be ready to design your own website.
Volunteering while you're on the road is an extraordinary way to make a difference, but the goal is not just to give.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to get to know a different culture, new people, learn about yourself, have a sense of perspective and even acquire new skills.
It could also be a good way to stretch the budget and allow for a longer stay, as many volunteer jobs offer lodging and food, and some pay a small fee.
Russian waterways were used by the Vikings to go to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. It is still possible to use parts of these waterways. Check if special permits are required, which is a possibility, and could be difficult to obtain.
The Arctic Ocean is connected to the Baltic Sea through the White-Baltic Sea Canal, via the Onega and Ladoga lakes, and to St. Petersburg, mostly by rivers and lakes.
Because Lake Onega also joins the Volga, it can be accessed from the Caspian Sea, via Russia.
You can be sure that once you get to the harbor, everything will be pretty obvious, you'll meet other boat hitchhikers, who will share their information with you.
Your task will be, basically, to post notices offering your help, to walk around the docks, to approach the people cleaning the yachts, to try to make contact with the sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible, after a while, everyone will know you and give you clues as to which ship is looking for people.
You must choose your frequent flyer airline alliance carefully.
While you may think that joining the airline with which you travel the most is the most logical thing to do, you should know that the benefits offered are often different and that sometimes traveler points can give you more benefits on another airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad, Qatar and Turkish Airlines have vastly increased their flights to Africa and offer connections to many of the continent's major cities at better prices than other European companies.
As of 2014, Turkish Airlines has flights to 39 destinations in 30 countries in Africa.
If you have extra time during the trip, find out how your total fare quote to Africa compares to a fare to travel around the world.
Remember to include extra expenses, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all places you visit outside Africa.
If you want to travel around the world by circling the southern hemisphere, your flight and destination options will be narrowed as there are few trans-oceanic routes.
No airline alliance covers the crossing of the three oceans in the southern hemisphere (and SkyTeam covers none).
However, Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern portion of the South Pacific that extends from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, an area that corresponds to LATAM Oneworld flights.
If you want to avoid the South Pacific and the western boundary of South America, you have other options besides this flight (see below).
In 1994, the Armenian-speaking area of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan launched a fight against the Azeri people.
With the support of Armenia, a new republic was formed, though it is not an established nation, not even with the official recognition of the Armenian government.
The links between Armenia and Azerbaijan continue to be affected by the diplomatic differences surrounding this region.
The Canal District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) in Amsterdam is the popular 17th-century neighbourhood that spreads out around Binnenstad.
The entire district was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, due to its unique historical and cultural value, and its property prices are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre (five lands) encompasses the small coastal towns of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso, which are located in Liguria, Italy.
They are part of the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built platforms on rugged, steep landscapes, even on cliffs overlooking the sea.
Its charm is partly due to the absence of visible corporate development. There are roads, trains and boats that connect the villages and vehicles cannot access from the outside.
There are subtle differences between the varieties of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland and the one used in France; however, their similarity is sufficient for them to be mutually intelligible.
In particular, the numbering system of French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has slight peculiarities that differ from French spoken in France and the pronunciation of some words is subtly different.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss will have learned standard French in school, so they could understand it, even if I spoke to them using the numbering system of standard French.
In many parts of the world, a handshake is a friendly gesture that means "Hola".
However, in Malaysia, at least among those living in rural areas, it means come here, similar to the index finger bending to point to one's own body, a gesture used in certain Western countries; it should only be used for that purpose.
Similarly, a British traveller visiting Spain might mistake a farewell gesture consisting of pointing the palm towards the one who is showing it (rather than the person being greeted) as a return gesture.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages that are created in order to facilitate communication between peoples who otherwise would have problems communicating.
They differ from vehicular languages, which are those natural or organic languages that, for some reason, become dominant as a tool of communication among speakers of other languages.
During the daytime heat, tourists may see mirages that create the illusion of seeing water, among other things.
These can be dangerous if the traveler follows the mirage, wasting valuable energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest deserts can turn dramatically cold at night, and if you don't have warm clothing, you run a real risk of suffering from hypothermia.
If you decide to go hiking in the rain forest, you will need to be careful of mosquitoes, especially during the summer.
Even if you are driving through the subtropical rainforest and open the doors for just a few seconds to get into the vehicle, that is enough for the mosquitoes to come up with you.
Avian influenza, more formally known as avian influenza, can affect birds and mammals.
Although fewer than a thousand cases have been reported in humans, some of these have had fatal outcomes.
While almost all those affected had contact with poultry in their work, there may also be some risk for birdwatchers.
Norway is characterized by steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a high, more or less homogeneous plateau.
These plateaus are often called vidde, a term that means wide, open space without trees; that is, unlimited expanse.
It is common in Rogaland and Agder to call them hei, which means a treeless wasteland, usually covered with heather.
Glaciers are not stationary, but flow down mountains, creating cracks or crevices that could be hidden by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of the ice caves could collapse, and the cracks could close.
Huge blocks break off and fall from the edges of glaciers and sometimes jump or roll further from the edge.
In the hill stations of India, the peak tourist season usually peaks during the summer.
However, its beauty and charm in winter are special, with a large number of mountain stations in which it snows in profitable amounts, making it possible to practice sports such as skiing and snowboarding.
The airlines that still offer bereavement fares are very few and barely discount the value of last-minute funeral travel.
The airlines that offer them are Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, for flights starting in the US or Canada, and WestJet.
In all cases, you must make the reservation by telephone and directly with the airline.
