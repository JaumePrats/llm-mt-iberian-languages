In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory already widely accepted, the discovery also offers specific data that fossils generally do not, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this bird has a brownish-brown upper part and a pale yellowish-orange underpart.
In addition, the discovery allows for better understanding of the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed rachis, but they do have other characteristics of the feathers (cerdas and barbules), the researchers concluded that the raquis is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure that presents the feathers suggests that its function was not related with flight, but as an indicator of temperature or as a signal of the same. The researchers support that, although it is the tail of a dinosaur young, the sample analyzed presents the plumage of an adult and not of a chicken.

Experts of the Princeton University and Uppsala University, in the U.S., and of the University of Uppsala, in Sweden, revealed that the new species evolved in two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much more time, due to the breeding between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fuertes, and a cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
The gold can adopt any shape and roll in tiny figures.
Not only can you twist and roll in sheets, but you can also stretch it out and twist it into a very thin thread.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is such delgadez that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called «illuminated manuscripts».
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator by mixing red colour powder with water.
The color of the juice of cabbage will be altered in accordance with how acidic or basic (alkaline) the substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the analyzed product determines its pH level.
The hydrogen atom is formed by a proton and an electron.

In some homes of the minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, there are remnants of sewage systems.
Baths also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China.
When you communicate with someone who is miles away from you, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then reflects it back to earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space through a rocket. The scientists use telescopes in space, since the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and view that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to lift a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has altered the world in unexpected ways.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transportation, such as the railroad or the automobile, among others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, such as rabbits, foxes, and antelopes.
Finally, there are many small cats (including the domestic cat) that feed on insects, rodents, birds, and other small animals.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the big cats that most socialize and live in large groups called manades.
Male herds are formed by one to three males of the same family group, joined with up to thirty females and their offspring.
By definition, a family of sisters and daughters.
Leopard manades have the same behavior as the wolves or the dogs, with whom they share many similarities (unlike the other great felines) both in their behavior as well as their lethality for their prey.
The tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim (but not too well), jump five times as high as a person of average height, and pull five times as much weight as a person of average height.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that are capable of emitting a roar.
The tiger's roar is not a roar fully sounding like that of the lion, but rather, like a prayer uttered in murmuring and shouting words.
The ocelot enjoys feeding on small animals. In as much as possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and other small animals.
Cats use their sense of smell to locate prey.
They have excellent night vision and in dark places, and they can move very quietly.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) departs from the main population of which they are a part (for example, if they migrate to a mountain or to a river, or if they move to a new island so that they can't return easily) they will often find themselves in a different environment from that to which they were accustomed.
The new environment will have different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need to have different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
There have been no significant changes in the original population, which still require of the same adaptations that they did in the past.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new surroundings, it begins to resemble the other population.
Finally, after millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will not be able to be classified as the same species.
Species diversification is the process by which new species are formed.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that they emit).
Plants use solar energy to generate their own food.
We build our houses from the plants and with them we also make clothes.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, therefore, it had no fear of other of its kind.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as a second group of sharp teeth in the palate, which translates to any thing that leaped at him, he had no escape.
We don't have the certainty, but it could have had the viperine.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex was not a threat to him.
The Romans ate a lot of unusual things in their banquets, like rats, pheasants, snails, and even a type of rodent, the lynx.

Verbigracia, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, or peas, and no Roman ever ate a turkey once.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a temple in the center of their city.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests sought to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
In some cases, temples were built with pyramid-shaped towers, called zigurats.
The top of the tower was a shrine for the goddess.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of great importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just showcases. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no great forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
Nearly no one lived in Greenland. According to Icelandic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey to the west, discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to its discovery, the indigenous peoples of the Arctic already inhabited the place for that then.
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland were all Scandinavian countries, but each had its own unique character.
If you have seen the film Treasure Island, perhaps you believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse side the phrase «Declaration of Independence original of July 4, 1776».
Although it is unknown who wrote it, it is known that the enormous document of parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the note has been added only as a rótulo.
If the D-Day landings had succeeded, then the liberation of the north of France would have been completed.
His government was in the hands of the French of «Vichy», who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders rather than fight against them.
The 15th of August, 1940, Operation Dragon was launched.
In just two weeks, the forces of the United States and the Free French had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is defined as a culture specific to a group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and relates to the word civis, which means citizen, as well as to civitas, which means city or city state and determines the size of the society.
Cities-state are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a legacy of enduring cultural heritage, and the propagation of homogeneous ideas.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving any lasting historical traces, and are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the War of the Revolution, the Thirteen Colonies formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, because there was no national executive or judicial power, such a function fell to the state governments, who often did not cooperate to enforce all of their laws.
He was not authorized to nullify state taxes or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval of all the states to amend the Constitution, and the states gave little importance to the central government.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful national team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, skiing, cycling, jogging and Formula One.
Ice hockey is the most popular winter sport in the United States.
In Japan, there are around 7000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the conglomerate/group of islands that surrounds it, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago, from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Portuguese sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwestern Taiwan, gave rise to a transformation in the indigenous method of production of grains, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in its plantations of rice and sugar.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coasts of Taiwan in 1683 and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government surrendered to the treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, who retained control of the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Peru.
The Canal District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century district surrounding the Binnenstad of Amsterdam.
By the mid-1970s, the restoration of Machu Picchu had reached thirty percent complete.
For example, the most common global fixed-format photographic film size is 35 mm, which was the size of film most widely used towards the end of the era of analog film.
Today, it is still produced, but the most important dimension is that of the image sensor of digital cameras.
In reality, the 35mm format is a little confusing, as its width is 36mm and its height is 24mm.
Therefore, the relation of this format (divide by twelve to calculate the simplest rational number equation) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g., the APS file format) are very similar to this relationship of aspect.
The rule of thirds, which has been subject to constant ridicule and many times ridiculed, is a simple rule that generates dynamism to the same time allowing for some order to the images.
Indica that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection that is formed between the horizontal lines and vertical lines that divide the image into three equal parts (see example).
During this period of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was challenged.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had united the European states despite their differences in languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the commoner.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth ought to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be reserved for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had been in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after the war began, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
Though the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, the violation of international law generally recognized and contained in many international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters from the ocean to block the entry of ships, even putting the safety of neutral ships at risk.
Germany was expecting a reduced response to its submarine warfare tactics.
Over the course of the 1920s, the attitude of the majority of the citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities committed during the First World War, the nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. to take a job in the Edison Company in New York.
Arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a note of recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last employment) and directed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of delimiting time periods. Each dynasty or family in the power constituted a distinct dynasty or family.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years, from the Hán dynasty to the Jin dynasty.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many of the nobility that fought for the throne.
One of the most bloody periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where millions of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
Many of its consequences have been political and social, such as the use of the metric system, the replacement of absolutism with republicanism, the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
In addition, after the revolution, the booths were open to all candidates, which allowed for the success of the most ambitious and prestigious candidates.
The same thing happens with the military, since, in place of class-based ranks, now they are based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for people of the working-class in other countries to take up their own revolutions.
Mahoma was interested deeply in matters beyond this worldly life.
The cave in itself, which lasted in the time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
In the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, andace a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
It is very difficult to find, even if one is certain of its existence. In the interior of the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains of the surrounding countryside.
Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the ancient Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., is one of the many pyramids and large structures built to honor the Egyptian ruler.
The Great Pyramid of Guiza, or the Necropolis of Guiza, in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids and temples were built in honour of his wives and family.

Should you feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but remember that the marks on your instruments of bow have been printed with a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of women in the market forced King Louis XVI, his two small children (Maria Theresa, eleven, and Louis Charles, four) and the sister of the king, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
In certain moment, a participant of the revolt scuffled the head of a royal executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipinos themselves paid the expenses of the American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of paying off the principal and interest of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the government of the Philippines in the banks of Wall Street.
From now on, the super profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Philippine people would constitute the principal gains of the American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, it is necessary to understand the circumstances that gave rise to their establishment.
The European period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300 AD (i.e., between the years 1000 and 1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages.
The technological determinism is a concept that comprises, pragmatically, a great range of ideas, from the impulse or imperative technology to a strict sense that there is a logical underlying that drives the destiny of mankind and that is manifested in the science of technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that the development of technology in itself is independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has «effects» on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of cars inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not feasible economically for a small volume of cars, so new techniques are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The use of automobiles also leads to a higher rate of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The cultural determinism of Romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geography molded people and, with the passage of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, when in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is known as the capital of fashion today, Constantinople was considered to be the capital of fashion in the European Middle Ages.
His fame for being the epicenter of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, its status declined, mainly due to the return of the Crusaders, who brought gifts, such as silk and spices, of greater value than the goods offered in the markets of the Byzantine Empire.
The title of «capital de la moda» was transferred, from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic architecture flourished between the 10th and the 14th centuries.
In the beginning, clothing was influenced by the culture of the Byzantine Empire in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the styles of the West could be delayed by up to 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Europe had developed a distinctive style of its own. One of the most significant developments of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to abroach their clothes.
Agriculture of subsistence is agriculture that produces enough food for the farmers and their families to meet their own needs.
Agriculture of subsistence is a simple, organic practice that combines the use of stored seeds originating from the region's ecological community with other methods that maximize production.
Historically, most farmers' main activity was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many countries in developing countries.
Cultural subcultures gather individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by society's standards.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of its members.
Characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, religious, or political, or a combination of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to this subculture by using distinctive and symbolic stylistic markers, such as fashion, gestures, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for gratifying the importance of sociabilization is to analyze the few and unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, misbehavior, or maltreatment, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called «savages». Some children are confined by people, in general their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the child's physical or intellectual disabilities.
It is possible that orphaned or abused children may have suffered traumatic or abusive childhood.
Some were raised by animals and some have lived on their own in the wilderness.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, he exhibits behaviors (within his physical capabilities) almost identical to that of the specific animal that cared for him, as well as his fear or indifference toward people.
Even though the project-based learning approach should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, the andamiage goes a little bit further.
The andamiage is not a teaching technique; it is, rather, an assistance that provides support to those who are new to a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The andamiage can be both real and virtual; to say it in other words, a teacher is a kind of andamio, but also is the small paper clip animation of Microsoft Office.
Virtual andamiages are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate, or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
Children can be placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and, even, extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment in which he or she does not have love, care and education; but happens.
We can perceive that the family-based welfare system provides a safe environment for these children.
The aim of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving, caring, and supportive tutors, medical care, and educational assistance.
The aim of foster care is to provide all the needs that were not met in the child's previous home.
Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The various features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of rewards and rewards.
For example, it is pointed out that learning and socialization are significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), user reactions to web sites were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of facial microexpressions, which are movements in the face of only a few milliseconds in duration.
The study of microexpressions is a relatively new field of psychology.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The Discourse of the President, explained the way in which those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury, can, no obstante, evaluate sincerity with precision.
Even suggests that human abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
There are two types of genetic variation: the hidden genetic variation and the manifested genetic variation.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination may vary between one generation and the next.
In the savanna, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of the human, to satisfy its amino acid requirements with the resources available to it.
It is more, not doing it carries serious problems: deceleration of growth, malnutrition, and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have constituted the source of plant protein resources of the simplest access, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and contain a great number of proteins that contain all of the essential amino acids.
In the end, we should not be surprised if our own forebears resolved their protein problems in the same way that chimpanzees of the savanna do today.
Non-REM sleep disorder (NREM sleep disorder) is the most common sleep disorder.
It can be achieved easily by using a gentler alarm clock that doesn’t wake you up completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process.
Other options that rely on the biological rhythm consist of drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before going to bed, which will force you to urinate in the morning.
The level of peace interior of a person is directly related to the amount of tension in his or her body and in his or her spirit.
As the more negative the tension, the more positive is the life force with which we are blessed. Each of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
All of us can achieve enlightenment. The only barrier is our tension and negativity.
Si bien las bases del budismo tibetano son las enseñanzas de Buda, se extendieron por el sendero del amor Mahayana y numerosas técnicas del yoga de la India.
In general, the laissez-faire is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation, and the love path.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is activated with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga.
Cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States was the result of facing a common enemy, Nazi Germany, during World War II. Terminated the war, the system, process, and culture of the two countries diverged.
Two years after the end of World War II, the allies were no longer allies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and would be fought in the following decades, through militaries substitutes, in battles from Africa to Asia, in fields of battle from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other sites.
Because the Polish defence was already broken by September 17, 1939, its only hope was to retreat and regroup in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Red Army soldiers invaded and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, infringing the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the non-aggression pact between Poland and the Soviet Union, bilateral and multilateral agreements, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
From time immemorial, the function of the navy has been to guarantee that his country maintains the right to transport its people and goods, while, at the same time, it interferes with the capacity of the enemy to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of it.
At the same time, the German U-boat fleet, using mainly submarines, tried to destroy this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as they did with the rest of Europe.
Goats were domesticated, for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the purpose of obtaining easily their milk, meat, skins, and leather, the ancient peoples started to take them away from them.
For centuries, domestic sheep were kept in flocks that wandered through the hills or other areas of grazing.
In England, railways had been installed by the mid-sixteenth century.
Though the rails of the wagons were made of simple planks of wood, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve a greater speed and carry heavier loads than on the rough roads of the day.
The introduction of railroad ties to keep the rails in their place was a relatively early development.
In the early 19th century, steam locomotives were introduced to the Netherlands.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels and, in 1767, iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transportation known was walking. The human race began walking two million years ago with the emergence of the Homo Erectus (which means man standing upright).
Sus predecesores, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
If bipedalism has been found in fossils of australopithecines from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs around 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, join environmentalist movements, or, even, we can become activists and fight to ameliorate, in some way, the suffering of tomorrow.
It is, in many cases, like the asymptomatic treatment. But if it is only a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is manifest that the world has suffered great changes, due to the advancements of science and technology, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, a draft written by hand and signed by the president of the House of Representatives, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing press of John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
The Dunlap Copies are a set of six prints by the Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn.
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time and read it on the steps of the Independence Hall, on July 8, 1776.
The Declaration of Independence of the United States of America was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest known copies of the Declaration of Independence.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.
Many people don't realize them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many characteristics in birds that still resemble the dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and clawed feet, they lay eggs and walk on two legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate on the manipulation of data in the binary system.
A binary number only has two possible values, they are the 0 and the 1 and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
The internal poisoning may not be apparent immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common for a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be found when a bottle of poisoned medicine or cleaning chemicals is open.
Read the label to obtain specific information about the appropriate first-aid treatment for that specific poison.
Insect parasites are arthropods that feed on other arthropods.
The term "chinche" is derived from the Spanish word "chinche".
Necrophilic bed bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
More than 400,000 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS).
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain and spinal cord, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
Studies indicated that women have twice as many chances of developing multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple might conclude that raising a child would not be the most appropriate for themselves or for the child.
These couples could potentially choose to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights to make way for a couple to adopt a child.
The objective of science is to discover the way in which the world works through the use of the scientific method.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide the scientific research.
The focus of naturalists and philosophers was on the works of classical authors; especially, on the Latin version of the Bible.
The thoughts of Aristotle, in particular the issues of science, even psychology, were accepted.
As the dominance of the Greek language waned, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophical and scientifically.
Many rhythms present in biological and behavioral processes depend on the existence of internal clocks and their production through internal rhythms.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely reactions to external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living things, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a self-sustaining period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterial cell using fags, or viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fago with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the mutation involves germline cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only germline mutations in cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
The tourism based on nature attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, which includes wildlife and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks, and study of information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Each morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross paths with other people whose jobs are in the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected with a system of transportation based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Currently, climate scientists say that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humankind for the last two million years.
All of them are part of society and make use of the transportation systems; and almost all of them complain about them.
In developed countries, it is uncommon to hear complaints about the quality of drinking water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the cause of such complaints and why do they occur daily? Are engineers of transport simply incapable? Or is there something more substantial that is happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
It is not easy to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of drivers.
There is a trend in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to have a consistent logical consistency and can be represented by mathematical approximation.
With the aim of more clearly illustrating the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both planning and design, as well as the operations of traffic devices.
The first birds to fly were insects. This helped them evade their enemies more easily and find food and a mate more effectively.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
It gives them a wider range of possible hiding spots from predators.
Currently, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that are unable to fold their wings.
Miles of years ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed his theory was wrong: that the Solar System orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to have some sense, does it?
The Amazon River is the largest and longest river in the world.
The Amazon River is the widest river in the world.
Del total del agua proveniente de los ríos del mundo que desemboca en los océanos, el 20 por ciento deriva del Amazonas.
The Amazon River is the longest river in the world.
The pyramids of Egypt continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, never surpassing the Great Pyramids of Guiza, nor in size nor in sublime technique of construction.
The ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their forebears, dating back to more than a thousand years ago.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population density.
The Italian language is the official language of the Vatican City State.
The Italian language is spoken daily by the majority of those who work within the state.
The entirety of the citizens who live in the Vatican adhere to the Roman Catholic Church.
Elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since ancient times, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is formed by a combination of one or several of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It guarded greater similarity with the matter of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, but, at the same time, it had the theory that they transformed into new substances that we see.
Alloys are, essentially, a combination of two or more metals. Recall that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are elements such as calcium and potassium.
Alloys may also contain small amounts of carbon, which is not a metal.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of an atom is so minute that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
The pencil was invented, and it won many friends.
Desfortunately, due to the implementation of new writing methods, pencils are less used and have lost their status.
Today, people write messages on computer screens. They don't need to, even, have a sacapuntas.
Only a question remains: what will become of the keyboard when something else emerges?
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to form a nuclear core with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when you roll a heavy cart up a hill. 

Spanish: 
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to decay with a minimal or almost no push.
The Moon’s surface is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is thinner under the moons of the sea and thicker under the mountains of the land.
It is possible that there may be more oceans on the near side due to their thinner crust, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on what attracts or interests people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grow up until reaching maturity.
These theories analyze what causes people to want certain things and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two theories of very well known are Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
On the other side of the spectrum is the attempt to continue to be one of the guys (or guys).
To managers of this category it is difficult to take decisions that fall badly to employees, impose disciplinary measures, assign responsibilities, evaluate performance, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from employees.
In the other end of the spectrum, you mutate into a person who believes he or she needs to change everything that has come before him or her and do it in his or her own way.
At the end of the day, the ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure is on the leader.
This form of behaviour often leads to leaders isolating themselves from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional computers apply to virtual machines, although there are a few differences.
A virtual team operates as a point of contact for its physical closest group.
Because of their greater autonomy, go-go dancers enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) constitutes also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The invisible team is the group responsible for the management and each member reports to them.
What would motivate an organization to undergo the demanding process of establishing an organization of learning?
When all available resources are used effectively in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and inventiveness.
Product of it, it is possible that the process of a team working to overcome a challenge to create a new innovative process to address the needs of the customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, the leadership must first create a culture of innovation, as well as a knowledge sharing and an organizational learning environment.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement approach as a method used to help organizations achieve greater level of performance.
The neurobiological data offer empirical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. Reduce, therefore, the field of inquiry and give it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavioral disorders contributes to the research of scientists.
Many types of brain damage, injuries, and diseases affect behavior and cause changes in mental functioning.
Thanks to the advancement of new technologies, we have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with sufficient information and material to develop models of simulation, which enables us to gain a better understanding of the mental processes.
If AI is associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of computer science.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence is the development of machines to automate tasks that require an intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include, among others, monitoring, planning, programming, capacity to answer customer queries, and recognition of facial, handwriting, and voice recognition.
These issues have become disciplines separate, focused on solving real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economy, medicine, engineering, and military, as well as in video games and personal computers.
Student study trips constitute a major part of all classrooms.
The solution comes from the technology, through virtual tours. The students can observe the exhibits in a museum, visit an aquarium, or view beautiful works of art seated with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion also is an excellent way to reflect on an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions of the website are preserved online.
Blogs can also contribute to improving the writing skills of students.
Because students tend to be the readers that most criticize, the writer of blogs starts to improve his/her writing, in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging demands that students be more understanding of the world that surrounds them.
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages learners to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, as well as establishing their own perspectives on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the current affairs of the country.

The area that now constitutes the eastern part of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani people, who were the most important indigenous group in this region and who lived as semi-nomadic hunters, as well as practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region hosted other indigenous peoples, for example, the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, fished and gathered as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, before known as «The Great Province of the Indies», was born in the sixteenth century, as a result of the encounter between the Spaniards and the indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards gave the first stage of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
From the time of Asunción, in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous identity and culture.

There are some chances that in the periphery islands you will not accept credit cards, but you can use British or American currency.
It is virtually impossible to change money in the Falkland Islands outside of the Falkland Islands, therefore, it is advisable to do so before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, there is summer when in the Northern Hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures exceeding +30° C during the summer.
The winter weather can be deceptive: even though it is very rare for temperatures to fall below freezing, the wind and humidity interact to make you feel colder than the temperature on the meter.
There are no specifically «rainy» or «dry» seasons; the amount of rainfall remains nearly the same throughout the year.
If you want to see wildlife, you don't have to feed it or disturb it.
