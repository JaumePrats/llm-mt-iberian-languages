In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that is already generally accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this bird has a reddish-brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or carotenoid colour on the lower part.
In addition, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Given that the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed axis, called a raxis, but do have other feather-like features (hairs and quills), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raxis is likely to be the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but to regulate body temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed shows the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than the plumage of a chick.

Although it was a highly theoretical work, the program was written with the purpose of simulating the observations made to the galaxy of Sagittarius.
It would be the forces of the dark matter present in the galaxy and the forces of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.

In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a booth and insert a pre-printed ballot into a sealed envelope that indicates the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter enters the ballot into the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French electoral law sets out the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent, which allows voters and observers to verify that there are no extra votes at the start of the voting and that no other votes are added which are not those of those who are voting, properly counted and authorised.
The candidates have the right to send representatives to oversee each stage of the process and, during the night, the volunteers count the votes under a rigorous supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

It was reported that around 9,400 homes in the region are without water supply and around 100 without electricity.
Some roads were damaged, train services were disrupted in the affected areas, and the airport of Noto, in the prefecture of Ishikawa, is still closed.
A bomb was detonated at the door of the Governor General's office.
Other three bombs were detonated in the immediate vicinity of government buildings in a two-hour period.
Although there are reports that the official death toll is eight and the authorities have confirmed that around 30 people were injured, the official death toll is still unknown.
Concentrations of cyanide and melamine were found in the urine samples of animals that died after eating food for pets contaminated.
The researchers indicated that the two compounds react with each other to give rise to crystals that can obstruct the renal function.
The experts detected the formation of crystals in the urine of the cats, due to the incorporation of melamine and cyanuric acid.
When compared through the use of Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), it could be determined that the composition of the crystals coincides with that found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but most of the products coming from Central America to this country are tax-free.
Even so, the countries of Central America imposed tariffs of up to 80% on the products we manufacture. They treat us like this.
It didn't make sense to me; it definitely wasn't fair.
All I'm saying to people is that you treat us the same way we treat you.
A law was proposed by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, which forbids the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill proposes that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
The Director of the Crown Prosecution Service, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be taken to court.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take over the business minister's post that Davey leaves vacant.
The 16th of February is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are due to appear before the Westminster Magistrates Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, both aged 25 and 21 respectively, died. Nicholas was the driver.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required reconstructive surgery to his face.
Uka's gun jammed while he was aiming at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, he can only see with one of his eyes, part of his skull is missing and his face had to be reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via a virtual link from a US Air Force base in his country of origin.
Carpanedo took part in two individual races apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he got a "Did not finish the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she got the 10th place in the women's giant slalom with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the 9th finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four skiers in the category failed to complete their race and a total of 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify for the next round.
The police in Madhya Pradesh were able to recover the laptop and the mobile phone that were stolen.
The deputy chief constable, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five men who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the superintendent of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused presented themselves before the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people in the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident took place was closed temporarily while the emergency services removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
In the beginning, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Court of the County of Edinburgh, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is under arrest awaiting trial, any eyewitness statement can be questioned, as her image has been subject to widespread dissemination.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about the suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for prosecutions, said it would not be making any further comment until a charging decision had been made.
According to the information that has been leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the pre-1967 borders.
Other topics that were also discussed included the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA is only accepting five.
During the complementary control of pests, the gamekeepers had to supervise the shooters closely, given that they were being monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Association of Australian Shooters (NSW) Inc., volunteers were recruited from within the Association of Australian Shooters.
Mick O'Flynn, who is currently in charge, provisionally, of the Office of Conservation and Heritage of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, pointed out that a comprehensive training and safety package was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it's the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the generalised protests that started in October against the regime.
The protests, at times violent, were caused by the fact that no elections are being held, in some cases since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, which have caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "non-serious".
The ministry commented on the delay in Apple's report, saying it was "truly lamentable".
Mariana was shaken by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage on the territory.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of indicators of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer of that country hijacked a bus and held tourists who were coming from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six people have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers occupied the place of an old lady because she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research into premature birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday the investigators for the government were able to recover the black boxes from the black box.
Lunar's fellow fighters also paid their respects.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Powder Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as me; even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
From 2008, of the 1400 people surveyed in advance of the 2010 federal elections, there was a growth of 8% of those who are opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II had ended.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In one end of the survey, 29 % of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, 31 % think that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100 meter freestyle and 200 meter freestyle, and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt following his complaints.
He hasn't been able to take painkillers to relieve the pain, because they're not allowed in the Games.
On the 25th of January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people checked the discovery by using various types of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of the scientists is to understand how planets are formed, in particular our own, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, aged 53, took office at the start of the year and last month signed into law a bill that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He described the rumours as "political gossip and nonsense"
It is speculated that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
Uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old technology of terrestrial radar, with the aim of enabling air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to the pilots.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered that the game would be played behind closed doors, without the fanatics of the team.
On Thursday, the science magazine Science published an article about the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands.
Experts from the University of Princeton, in the US, and from the University of Uppsala, in Sweden, announced that the new species was able to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, due to the reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migratory, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on any shape and be rolled up into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it could be used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator of pH using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of ions of hydrogen (the H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its level of pH.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, an ion of hydrogen is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Shake both powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, rub them together to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in their hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and will form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with drainage in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, were found traces of sewer systems.
They also had public toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilisation, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one is communicating with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and view that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster way of transport.
Thanks to her, today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, such as rabbits, hares and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (which include domestic cats that are independent of humans) that feed on species of small size that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, birds and reptiles.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the big cats that socialise the most and their lives are spent in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, joined with up to thirty females and their calves.
Generally, females are closely related to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behaviour as packs of wolves or dogs, with which they share a surprising similarity (unlike the other great felines) in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
A fully integrated athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, jump and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. Where possible, they will hunt monkeys, rodents, birds and reptiles. Almost all of their prey will be much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) using their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, on top of that, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by mimicking their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they come (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island), they will often find themselves in a different environment to the one they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
As time goes by, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will no longer be possible to classify them as the same species.
This process receives the name of speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an ineludible and fundamental consequence of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from the plans and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except for other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as another group of teeth in the palate, which means that anything that got in his way, had no chance of escaping.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been viperine. Its diet included tortoises, large fish, other mosasaurs and even could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a Tyrannosaurus Rex was a threat to it.
While most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some less conventional items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women sat down to eat, while the wealthy and men ate standing up.
It is not possible that the recipes of the ancient Rome include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered to be their home.
The people carried sacrifices to the gods and the priests were trying to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
In some cases, special towers were built with a pyramidal shape, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the middle of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
The Jewish families spent the majority of their time outdoors.
The women were cooking in the courtyard; the shops were just display windows that faced the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to their discovery, the Eskimos were already living in that place at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the film Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. The back of the document does contain something written, but it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Declaration of Independence original of the 4th of July 1776". The text is written on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that the huge document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation has been added only as a label.
Although the D-Day landings had succeeded in liberating the north of France, there was still the south to be dealt with.
His government was in the hands of the French of "Vichy", who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On the 15th of August 1940, Operation Dragoon was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that forms part of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilisation derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, as well as civitas, which means city or city state and which, in addition, determines the size of the society.
State cities are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization requires a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy, and a homogenous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognised as civilisations in their own right.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to fix taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, this function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to make sure that all their laws were complied with.
He was also not allowed to annul fiscal or customs laws between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed to their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practised are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the north, with athletes taking part in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan there are around 7000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who were sailing in the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, gave rise to a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labour to work in their plantations of rice and sugar.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal regions of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this region as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, who retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu had been restored and work continues to this day.
To illustrate, the most common format for still photography around the world is 35mm, which was the size of film most commonly used towards the end of the era of film photography.
Today it is still being produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship has been transferred to the formats of digital image sensors in cameras.
In truth, the 35mm format is a bit confusing, as its measurements are 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relation of this format (dividing by twelve in order to calculate the simplest rational number) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g. the APS group of formats) are similar or very similar to this relation of appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing for a certain order to be given to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had been able to unite European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church should be used for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many people wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognized international legal principle and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters in whole sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting at risk, even, neutral ships.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought they would be facing a similar reaction to their unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation happening in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out between many noblemen who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was that of the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, because, instead of basing the charges of the army on class, now they are based on merit.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave in itself, which has lasted in time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one was sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen more than the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains in the surrounding area. From the inside of this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that is still standing is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramidal structures built to honour the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honour of his wives and family.
The mark of "upwards arc" is similar to a V and the mark of "downwards arc" is similar to a grapheme or a square without its lower border.
Above means to start at the tip and push the bow, and below means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, whereas a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the bow have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On the 6th of October 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They travelled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd who were shouting and making threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point, a participant in the protest shook the head of a executed guard in Versailles in front of the Queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people paid the costs of war for the imperialism of E.E. U.U. in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of paying the majority of the government's expenses and interest on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
Already, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in Europe during which these events take place is known as the High Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300.
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The determinism of technology is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the impulse or imperative of technology to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and how it is related to the laws of science and how they are expressed in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on its own independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on the societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of cars necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new techniques of manufacture are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of cars also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in the romanticism, according to studies by Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography moulded people and, with the passage of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography which, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was known as such in the feudal era.
His fame as the epicentre of luxury began around 400 BC and lasted until around 1100 AD.
During the 12th century its status declined, especially due to the return of the Crusaders, who brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The cusp of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the form of dress received great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the western styles could take a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of this period was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Agriculture of subsistence is understood as that whose objective is to produce enough food to feed only the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of stored seeds from the region's ecoregion with the rotation of crops or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many countries in the developing world.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality from the mainstream and provides them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to this by using distinctive and symbolic style, such as fashion, gestures and slang.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for graphically representing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a disabled child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the feral children may have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical capabilities) almost equal to those of the specific animal that took care of it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Although learning based on projects should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, an assistance that provides support to those who are going through a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented either in a real or virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also so is the small animated sticky note in Microsoft Office.
The virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been too complex for the student to understand on their own.
They welcome children into their homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care or education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the system of foster care provides a safe environment for these children.
The aim of our foster care system is to offer safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The aim of the family placement is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home from which the child was removed.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different characteristics of the Internet open up new dimensions from the point of view of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of users to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "long-term relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are movements in the face lasting only a few hundredths of a second.
Specifically, it is claimed that, through the correct reading of their microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", explained how those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of the speaker with precision.
It also suggests that the ability to interpret human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes that variation from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination mix up the variation between one and the next generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available to it.
In fact, not doing it can cause serious problems: slowing down of growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except when cooked.
On the other hand, foods derived from animals (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain the full range of essential amino acids.
In the end, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors resolved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
The interruption of sleep consists of waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved quite easily with a soft alarm clock that will wake you up without waking you up completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa application process. In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm consist of drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person experiences is the opposite of the amount of tension that they have in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we can deal. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that gets in the way is our tension and negativity.
Although the bases of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they extended to the path of loving-kindness Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general terms, laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be unblocked, the chakras can be activated and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. When the war ended, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up by distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who had been allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would continue for the next 40 years and would be fought with substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that for the 17th of September 1939 the Polish defence was already broken, their only hope was to retreat and reorganise themselves in the extension of the Romanian front.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, the Soviet-Polish Mutual Assistance Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to ensure that its country can transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The campaign of the North Atlantic in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this traffic.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as they did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were domesticated, for the first time, about 10 000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
With the aim of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes started to take them.
In general, domestic goats were kept in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasture, tended by herdsmen who were often children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, the railways had been installed in the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and to carry heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place was carried out quite early. However, gradually, it was realised that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear and tear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels and, in 1767, iron rails were used for the first time.
The first form of transport that was known was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, didn't have the habit of walking upright.
While traces of bipedalism have been found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, form part of environmentalist movements or, even, we can become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, the suffering of the future.
It is, in many cases, like the asintomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary solution, we should try to find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of the human race, and the problems have intensified due to the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by the Congress on the 4th of July, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, who lived a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
It was John Nixon who read the Declaration of Independence for the first time in the courtyard of the Independence Hall, on July 8th.
On the 6th of July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on the 9th of July. On the 10th of August, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are the birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly skin and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs in the same way as the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work on the manipulation of coded data under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are the 0 and the 1 and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is to find a bottle of medicine or cleaning chemicals open.
Read the label to find out about the specific first aid information for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasite insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with lice, a very developed species to parasitize humans.
Cockroaches and bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are reported in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system is the union of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, which is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women have twice the chances of men to suffer from EM.
A couple could conclude that raising a child would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific research.
However, it is not an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide the scientific investigation.
The focus of naturalists as well as philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts on science, especially those on psychology, were accepted.
As the domain of the Greek language was declining, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in the behaviour depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining way and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA consisted of a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They carried out two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fungus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulphur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks, and study of information on the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take photographs and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are located in the place from which they just came.
In this dynamic transfer system, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Currently, scientists support that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of the society and uses the transport systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear such complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason that transport systems give rise to such complaints and why do they break down so often? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial going on?
The flow of traffic is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behaviour of the drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be represented approximately by mathematical models.
In order to graph more clearly the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both the planning and design as well as the operations of the road network.
The first species to take to the air were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that are unable to fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Millions of years ago, a man called Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we don't perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon river is the most caudalous and the second most extensive river in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazonas is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total amount of water that comes from the world's rivers and ends up in the oceans, 20% comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never managed to surpass the size or the sublime technique of their construction.
The old Egyptian town of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest country in terms of population.
The Italian is used in the Vatican, both to write its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language that is spoken daily by the majority of those who work within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens who live in the Vatican adhere to the Roman Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known since antiquity, since they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but, at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the Periodic Table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. From now on, there are also metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are traces of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of very small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Because of this, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They don't even need to get close to a pencil.
Only time will tell what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's similar to what happens when you roll a heavy car up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, i.e. they tend to disintegrate with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and of about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more volcanoes on the side closer to the sea due to the fact that their crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The content theories focus on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines claim that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up until they reached maturity.
These theories analyse what causes people to want the things they want and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two very well known theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue to be "one of the boys" (or girls).
It is difficult for managers in this category to make decisions that are unpopular with their employees, impose disciplinary measures, carry out performance reviews, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from their staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it is necessary to change everything that the group has been doing until now and do it in their own way.
In the end, the ultimate success or failure of the team is down to the leader.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams also apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Often, the members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
In general, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet at different times, which, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a'real invisible team' (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What motive could there be for an organisation to submit itself to the process of establishing an organisation for learning? One of the purposes of applying the concepts of organisational learning is to promote innovation.
When all of the available resources are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this, it is possible that the process of an organisation that works together to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, the leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organisations to achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and give it greater accuracy.
The correlation existing between brain pathology and behaviour contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours can affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a speciality of great importance within computer science, which is responsible for the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The research in the field of AI implies the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and consultation requests from customers, as well as facial recognition, handwriting and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The system of Artificial Intelligence is now often used in the sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and the military, in the same way as it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual excursions. The students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online in the form of an album of memories.
Blogs can also contribute to improving the writing of students. Even though students usually start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes in front of an audience.
Due to the fact that students tend to be the most critical readers, the blogger starts to make an effort to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging requires students to be more understanding of the world around them. The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics.
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are more to the south and the north hosts the natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some of them are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison of the population that causes great surprise to many: there are more African Americans in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we are talking about wild life.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
The Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and it was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial influence of Europe and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region borders with the Sahel to the north, and with the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their real marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in your rejection of men and don't be afraid to defend your position (even if there are cultural differences or not, that's not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians, who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 they abandoned it after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places to go shopping in all of Morocco.
In the surrounding area of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of knick-knacks, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the province of Kivu in the North.
The city is also the base for scaling the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking excursions are some of the most economical in Africa.
To travel within Goma, you can opt for a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given "Tombuctú" an image of an exotic and distant land.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts a lot with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, in each of which a different wild life is developed.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognised as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all the natural reserves of South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
A comparison has been made between the buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong and a graph of luminous bars that is evident by the presence of the waters of the Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon side, which is located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is most densely concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see evidence of the past colonial history of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast towards the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans to be a World Heritage Site.
Despite this, the forests are not only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wild life and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers in the area and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) all day, but the majority, especially those going east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 am.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster bus service, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The full functioning of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that now constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as hunter-gatherers, as well as practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá aboriginal groups lived in the region, hunting, gathering and fishing as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, previously known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spaniards started the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to conserve a good part of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also watch other tournaments and lower league games throughout the year.
On the site of the Argentine Association of Polo you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The value of the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in relation to the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there. It's in front of the shop FIC West, in Stanley.
Sterling is usually accepted in any place within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There is a good chance that credit cards will not be accepted on the islands of the periphery, but you may be able to use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to be able to define the method of payment accepted.
It's practically impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do it before leaving.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and viceversa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
The winter cold can be deceptive: while it is very rare for temperatures to fall below the point of freezing, the wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild life is still wild, so don't feed it and don't get in the way.
According to the authorities in the parks, you must keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals.
Despite how docile they may appear, the fact is that bison, bighorn sheep, elk, bears and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Dozens of visitors suffer injuries every year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.

The reservation of accommodation in advance gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to stay when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents tend to have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camp sites.
In general, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined packages of flights and accommodation.
They can also keep the reservation in case you need more time to think about the offer, or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the majority of those who attend the music events decide to camp at the venue and the majority of the spectators consider that it is a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you will need to get there early to get a place near the music events.

Any person who intends to drive in high latitudes or in mountain passes must be prepared for the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy or snow-covered roads, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as you do on the bare tarmac.
During snowstorms, it can fall so much snow that it can trap you in a very short time.
In addition, visibility can be reduced by snow or by condensation or ice that forms on the windows of the car.
On the other hand, in many countries the conditions of ice and snow are normal and the traffic flows almost without any interruption throughout the year.
It is likely that safaris are the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable experience for many visitors.
The popular use of the term safari refers to the trips to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, in particular in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles and the standard equipment will make it possible to have a good view.
In some cases, lions, tigers and leopards can be shy, so you'll have a better chance of seeing them using binoculars.
A safari on foot (also known as "walking safari", "safari of walking" or "walk") is a walk through the bush, either for a few hours or for a few days.

Ironing clothes while they are still wet can help to dry them. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board to lend to guests, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a flat iron to hand, or if you don't want to use a flat iron, you can try with a hair dryer, if it's available.
Don't let the fabric get too hot, as it could shrink or, in extreme cases, catch fire.
There are different methods for purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain specific threats.
In some places, all you need to do is boil water for a minute, in others, you need to boil it for several more.
Not all filters have the same effectiveness, and if this worries you, you should consider buying bottled water with a seal of approval from a certified company.
It is possible that travellers may come across plagues of animals of which there is no knowledge in the regions from which they come.
Plagues are capable of ruining food, causing irritation or, in more serious cases, causing allergic reactions, spreading poison or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases, on their own, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals through the use of their force, are not usually included in the category of plagues.
The free trade of excise duties offers an opportunity to acquire, in certain places, products exempt from excise duties and taxes.

On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging stretch of road and often goes through remote and lonely areas.
If you don't usually drive on rural roads, keep your eyes open: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and closed curves.
The speed limits are notoriously lower than in the previous sections and the ones that follow, usually 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph), and their strict compliance is even more important than in any other section.
However, curiously, the cell phone signal is much better here than in many other sections of the road such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German bakery is of good quality and, in Bavaria, the cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those that are made in Austria, its neighbour to the south.
Common are fruit tarts, with apples baked inside all year round and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many German products that are baked in the oven also have almonds, hazelnuts and other dried fruits. In general, the popular cakes make a great combination with a strong cup of coffee.
If you have a craving for small but tasty pastries, try the Berliner, also known as a Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.

The stirrups are the supports for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
Although they provide greater stability for the rider, they can present problems of security, as it is possible that their feet may get caught in them.
If a jockey is thrown from a horse, but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the horse runs away. To reduce the risk, there are a series of safety precautions.
First of all, most of the riders use riding boots with a narrow sole.
In addition, there are saddles, especially English saddles, with security bars that allow the leathers of the saddle to detach from the structure if a rider who is thrown off tugs back.
The Cochamó Valley is the most popular climbing destination in Chile and is known as the "Yosemite of South America" with a variety of extensive walls and granite cliffs.

Skiing and snowboarding are popular winter sports that consist of sliding down a slope on skis or a snowboard.
Skiing is one of the main activities of travel with many enthusiasts, called "skiers", who organize their holidays completely based on skiing in a specific place.
The idea of skiing is very old, as there are cave paintings that represent skiers and which date back to around 5,000 BC.
As a discipline, alpine skiing dates back to the 17th century. In 1861, the Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Skier on cross-country skis: also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or backcountry skiing.
Although they are related, in general they do not involve the practice of cross-country skiing or alpine mountaineering, developed on steep slopes and with skis and boots much more rigid.
Imagine the ski slope as a hiking trail.
In satisfactory conditions, it will be able to cover distances a little longer than if it were on foot, but very rarely will it be able to reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a backpack full of good weight on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling from one country to another would mean having to deal with visa applications and passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen space functions as a single country in this sense.
Generally, if you move within this region, you will be able to cross the border without having to go through a passport control post again.
In the same way, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for permits for each of the member countries of this space separately. This will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects older than 100 years are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the lower age limit might be more restricted in places like North America than in Europe.
It may happen that products made by hand are catalogued as antiques, even though they are newer than goods of similar characteristics manufactured in series.
The breeding of reindeer is a fundamental way of life for the Lapps and the culture associated with this commercial activity is important for many who are not involved in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Laplanders have devoted themselves to reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but have lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer, mainly, as a means of transport.
Today, many Lapons work in modern commercial activities. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.

If your country of destination is subject to a travel alert, this could affect your medical insurance or the cancellation of your trip.
It is possible that you may want to consult the recommendations of other governments, but they are intended for their own citizens.
For example, a visitor from North America in the Middle East might face different situations to those of a European or an Arab.
The travel warnings are only a brief summary of the political situation in another country.
The points of view that are presented tend to be superficial, generic and too simplified in comparison with the more detailed information available on other sites.
The term severe weather refers, in general, to any severe weather event that is capable of causing significant damage, social disruption or death of people.
Severe weather can occur at any point on the planet and there are different types depending on the geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.

A normal course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days, and includes role-playing games, first aid, and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines about survival in the wild are common, but publications about war zones are scarce.

Transgender people who haven't had surgery shouldn't have to go through body scanners with their dignity and privacy intact.
The return currents are the flow that recedes from the waves that break on the shore, frequently in a reef or similar.
Due to the submarine topography, the return flow meets in certain areas of greater depth and there can be a rapid current with a direction to deeper waters.
The majority of drownings are caused by trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as I get out of the current, swimming back will not be more difficult than usual.
Make the attempt to get to some place where he won't be able to reach again or, if he has the skills and someone has seen him, it might be convenient to wait for him to be rescued.
The impact of returning home happens before the cultural (there is no honeymoon period), takes longer to go away and can be harder.
People who are easily able to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt back to their native culture.
When he returns home after living abroad, he will have adapted to the new culture and will have lost some of the habits of his native culture.
When you travelled abroad for the first time, the people were probably patient and understanding, as they knew that travellers need to adapt to a new country.
The people may not foresee that tolerance and understanding are also necessary for the return of travellers to their homes.
The light show and the sound pyramid are one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
In the darkness, you can see the pyramids and look at them in silence before the show starts.
Generally, you'll be able to hear the sound of tourists and vendors at all times. The history of sound and light is like a book of fairy tales.
The Sphinx appears as the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and all of them are lit up.
The discovery of the Shetland Islands South occurred in 1819 and are several nations that claim them. They have the largest number of bases, reaching 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsular territory. The largest island is King George, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Other islands include Livingston and Deception, where there is a spectacular natural harbour formed by the flooded caldera of a volcano that remains active.
The Earth of Ellsworth, whose boundaries are defined by the Bellingshausen Sea, is a region that is located to the south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the Peninsula mix with the plateau and then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern sector, the Sentinel Range contains the highest peaks of the Antarctic, the Vinson Massif, with a summit at 4892 metres on Mount Vinson.

A satellite phone can't be compared to a mobile phone, because, to make a call, you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite.
The service is often used in water transport, including recreational boats, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice.
You can check with your telephone service provider for more information on how to subscribe to this service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option for those who plan to take a sabbatical.
This is very popular among school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before university without putting their education at risk.
In many cases, enrolling in a study abroad program during a sabbatical year can, in fact, increase the chances of gaining access to higher education once one returns to the country of origin.
Normally, there will be a registration fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing: the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the most caudalous lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a recreational activity at a national level in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
The same thing happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but, taking that into account, it is quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the exclusive cruises that take place on the Baltic Sea include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you have the possibility of making a visit to the historic city for a few days during your return journey, sleeping on board the ship at night.
If you only disembark during excursions, you don't need a separate visa (since 2009).
In the brochures of some cruises, Berlin, Germany appears. However, as can be seen from the map above, this city is not near the sea and visiting it is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can generate fear in people of any age and place, particularly if they have never gone through the experience or if they have lived through a traumatic situation.
Don't feel ashamed of it: it's no different from other types of fears and personal misfortunes that afflict so many others.
For some, understanding a little about how planes work and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear that comes from a lack of knowledge or a feeling of not having control.
The courier companies are paid very well for making fast deliveries. Often, time is very important when it comes to commercial documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
The big companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for smaller companies and other routes.
If they sent it by air freight, it may have taken a few days for it to be unloaded and cleared through customs.
The only way to do it more quickly was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations prohibit transporting luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to travel in first class or executive class on a plane is to spend a fortune on that privilege (or, what is better, have your company pay for you).
But this has a price: in general, you can pay up to four times more for a business class ticket and up to eleven times more for a first class ticket.
In general, it's a waste of time trying to get discounts for first class or business class seats on direct flights.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a basic group of travellers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and will charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldavia is Chişinău. Its regional language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldavia is a republic made up of many ethnicities, among which there have been conflicts of that kind.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, to the east of Moldavia, which has its own government and currency, but which no member of the United Nations recognises.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic links between the two parts of Moldavia have been re-established.
Orthodoxy is the largest religion in Moldavia.

The people of Haldarsvík have excursions to the nearby island of Eysturoy and have an atypical octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting sculptures of marble in the shape of a dove on some of the graves.
It's worth dedicating half an hour to take a walk around the fascinating village.
To the north and easy to reach is the romantic and hallucinating city of Sintra, which gained popularity among foreigners due to a vivid account that Byron made of its splendours.

Don't ruin the place by making marks or grafitis on the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. Roughly half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, most people understand it and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, due to the fact that Catalan is, legally, the first official language, the majority of the signs are written only in that language.
Even so, Spanish is also used a lot in public transport and other buildings.
While the usual adverts in the Metro are only in Catalan, the unplanned interruptions are broadcast in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, impolite and arrogant.

A few courtesies on his part will make the apparent brusqueness of the Parisians disappear quickly.
The National Park of the Plitvice Lakes is very wooded, mainly with oaks, pines and spruces, and presents a vegetation between alpine and Mediterranean.

The brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the badger, the lynx and the wild boar, are some of the exotic animals that can be found in the place.
During the visit to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and can't have their shoulders uncovered.
Although most monasteries give coats to women who arrive without being prepared, if you bring yours, especially if it's bright colours, the monk or nun will smile at you as you enter.
Following the same line, it is demanded that men wear trousers that cover their knees.
This can also be borrowed from the clothes available when entering, but this clothing is not washed after each person who uses it, so it may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. "One size fits all for all men!"
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of other similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in all its recipes.

However, those who speak a little Spanish may arrive at the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and that it is not necessary to study it in detail.
Today, generally speaking, premodern observatories have become obsolete and are now functioning as museums or educational destinations.
Given that, in its heyday, light pollution was not a major problem as it is today, it is common to find them in cities or on campuses, being easier to access than those built in modern times.
The majority of modern telescopes consist of huge structures installed in remote areas with favourable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, is a traditional Japanese custom since the 8th century.

They also limit the routes for popular walking and cycling paths.
For the Christian religion, Christmas is one of its most important festivals, which celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ.
There are many traditions associated with this festival that have also been adopted by non-Christians around the world.
It is tradition to spend the night of Easter in vigil in some exposed place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches tend to offer a Vigil Mass on Saturday night during the Easter weekend and, generally, the congregations begin the celebrations for the resurrection of Christ as soon as midnight arrives.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because they are so far away from the continent, the mammals could not reach the Galapagos Islands, so the giant tortoise became the main grazer in the Galapagos.
Many species of mammal have been introduced to Galápagos since man arrived on the archipelago, such as goats, horses, and cattle, or rodents, dogs and cats.
If you travel to the arctic or antarctic regions in winter, you will live the experience of polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Given that the sky will be dark for most of the day, it is a great opportunity to see the aurora borealis.
Thanks to the sparse population that lives in these regions and because of the lack of light pollution, you can also delight in the stars.
In Japan, the working culture has a more vertical structure and is more formal than what westerners might be used to.
The typical clothing of the business world are suits and the colleagues are called by their surnames or by their job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental, where emphasis is placed on the efforts of the group before focusing on individual achievements.
Often, workers need the approval of their superiors to make decisions and it is expected that they will obey without question.
