In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory already widely accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this bird has a chestnut-brown upper part and a pale yellow underpart.
In addition, the discovery allows scientists to better understand the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Because the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed rachis, but they do have other characteristics of feathers (cerdas and barbules), the researchers reached the conclusion that the raquis is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather as a means of regulating body temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers suggest that, although it is the tail of a dinosaur young bird, the feathers show the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' appraisals were that, even though it is the tail of a dinosaur of short age, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult bird than that of a chicken.

A new species of bird has been discovered in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts of Princeton University and Uppsala University, in the U.S., and of Uppsala University, in Sweden, gave to know that the new species evolved in two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, due to breeding between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortsi, and a cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
The gold can adopt all kinds of shapes and roll up in tiny figures.
It is also possible to stretch it out and twist it into a very thin thread.
He can be very thin and adhere to another metal.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator by mixing red chili pepper juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered in accordance with how acidic or basic (alkaline) the substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) present in the analyzed product determines its pH level.
The hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron. Thus, a hydrogen ion is the result of taking a proton from a hydrogen atom and replacing it with an electron.
Agita both dust dry powders together and, after doing so, with cleaned and wet hands, form a ball.

The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had indoor toilets with discharge in almost all houses, which were connected with a sophisticated sewage system.
In some homes in the cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, remnants of sewage systems were found.
The ancient Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese also had public baths. In the ancient Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is miles away from you, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and, then, reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space through a rocket. The scientists use telescopes in space, since the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and view that we see.
We need a giant rocket, of more than 100 feet in height, to be able to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways.
Thanks to her we have many means of transportation, such as the railroad or the automobile, among others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, such as rabbits, foxes, and antelopes.
Finally, there are many small cat species that eat insects, rodents, birds, and other small animals.
The secret of his success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents him from competing with other cats.
Lions are the big cats that most socialize and live in large herds.
The herds are formed by one to three males of the same family group, joined with up to thirty females and their offspring.
For the most part, females tend to be closely related to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Leopard manades have the same behavior as those of wolves or dogs, with whom they share a striking resemblance (in contrast to the other great felines) both in their behavior and in their lethality for their prey.
An integral athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, jump five times as high as a person of average height, and pull five times as much weight as a person of average strength.
The tiger is of the same species (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that are capable of emitting a roar.
The tiger does not roar like a lion, but rather as a prayer uttered in murmuring and whispering.
The ocelotes enjoy feeding on small creatures. In as much as possible, they will hunt small mammals, reptiles, birds, and small birds.
The scientists believe that the ocelotes track animals to eat (prey) through the sense of smell.
They have very good night vision and in dark and dark places, and they can move very quietly. They hunt their prey in the dark, mimicking their surroundings, and then they ambush their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) departs from the main population of which they are descended (for example, if they migrate to a mountain or to a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot return with ease) they will often find themselves in an environment different from that to which they were accustomed.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need to have different characteristics or adaptations from those it had before to be a competitor strong.
No changes have been made to the original population, which still require of the same adaptations that were made in the past.
Over time, as the population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population.
Finally, after millions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will be impossible to classify them as of the same species.
This process receives the name of species, which simply means the development of new species.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
The food of plants is generated by solar energy, through photosynthesis.
We build our houses from the plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of our food is made from plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, so it had no fear of other of its kind.
His teeth were long and sharp like knives, with another set of sharp teeth in the palate, which translates to that any thing that happened to him, there was no escaping it.
We don't have the certainty, but could have had the viperine. His diet included turtles, large fishes, other mosasaurids, and, even, could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex was not a threat to him.
The Romans also ate some unusual foods, such as rats, pheasants, and even a type of rodent, the hare.
Another thing in which they differed was that the poor and women ate lying down, while the wealthy and men ate while standing up.
It is not possible that the ancient Romans' recipes included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, peas, or peanuts, and no Roman of antiquity ever tasted a roasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods their own temple, which they considered their home.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
In some cases, temples were built with pyramid-shaped towers, which formed part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a sanctuary special for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of any great importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time in the open air.
The women cooked in the kitchen; the shops were just showcases that gave to the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no great forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Most inhabitants lived in Greenland. According to the Icelandic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey to the west, he discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, unknown to authorities, although they know he is a member of the Inuit ethnic group.
If each country was a separate kingdom, there were clearly marked differences in relation to the people, the kings, the customs and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Treasure Nation, perhaps you believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the reverse of the map contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse side the phrase «Declaration of Independence original of July 4, 1776».
Although it is unknown who wrote it, it is known that the enormous document of parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the note has been added only as a rótulo.
If the D-Day landings had succeeded, the liberation of the north of France would have been completed.
His government was in the hands of the French of «Vichy», who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders rather than fight against them.
Operation Dragoon was launched on 15 August 1940, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces had achieved the liberation of southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is defined as a culture specific to a specific group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and relates to the word civis, which means citizen, as well as to the word civitas, which means city or city state and determines the size of the society.
Cities-state are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a legacy of enduring cultural heritage, and the propagation of a homogeneous culture.
Cultural minorities often disappear without leaving any historical traces, and are not recognized as civilizations properly speaking.
During the War of the Revolution, the Thirteen Colonies formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, because there was no national executive or judicial power, such duties rested with the state governments, who often did not cooperate to enforce all of their laws.
He was not authorized to annul taxes or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval of all the states to be amended, and the states gave little importance to the central government.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful national team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, skiing, cycling and Formula One racing.
Winter sports count with more popularity in the northern regions, with athletes participating in international and Olympic tournaments and events.
In Japan there are around 7000 islands (the largest island is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the conglomerate/group of islands that surrounds it, it is often referred to as an archipelago, from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, this is, island beautiful.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, gave rise to a transformation in the aboriginal method of production of grains, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in its plantations of rice and sugar.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of northern and western Taiwan in 1683 and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government adheres to the treaty of Shimonoseki, through which China cedes sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, who maintains its control of the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three capital structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
It has been rebuilt the majority of the buildings on both ends of the complex with the aim of enabling tourists to visualise how they looked originally.
By the mid-sixties, most of Machu Picchu had been restored and the work continues today.
For example, the most common fixed-format photographic film size is 35 mm, which was the size of film most commonly used towards the end of the era of the analog film.
Today, it is still being produced, but its relationship dimension is no longer important.
In reality, the 35mm format is a little confusing, as its width is 36mm and its height is 24mm.
By dividing by twelve, the dimensional relationship of this format is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g., the APS file format) are similar or identical to this relationship of aspect.
The rule of thirds, which has been subject to many jokes and many times ridiculed, is a simple guideline that generates dynamism to the same time allowing for some order to the images.
It indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection that is formed between the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into three equal parts (see example).
During this period of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was challenged.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had been able to unite the European states despite their differences in languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the commoner.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth ought to be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be reserved for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after the war began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
If the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated the international law generally recognized and contained in many international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters in complete sections of the oceans to block the entry of ships, putting at risk, even, the safety of neutral ships.
Germany was expecting a reduced response to its submarine warfare tactics.
Over the course of the 1920s, the attitude of the majority of the citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities committed during the First World War, the nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with four cents, a book of poems, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his former manager in his last job) and directed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting time periods. Each dynasty or family in the power constituted a distinct dynasty or family.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years, from the Hàn dynasty to the Jìn dynasty.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many powerful nobles that fought for the throne.
One of the most bloody periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where millions of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
Many of its consequences are political and social, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
After the revolution, the positions were open to all candidates, regardless of gender.
The same applies to the military, since, in place of classes, now the army bases its recruitment on the calibre.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for people of the working-class in other countries to take up their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life.
The cave itself illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
In the peak of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, there is a cave completely isolated from the rest of the planet.
It is very difficult to find, even if one is certain of its existence. In the interior of the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains of the surrounding countryside.
Of the Seven Wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the ancient Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many pyramids and large structures built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Great Pyramid of Guiza, or the Necropolis of Guiza, in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several tombs, temples, and the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and relatives.
The mark of the arrowhead resembles a V and the mark of the arrowhead resembles a square.
Above means that the archer must start at the head of the arrow.
The sound produced by the bow is softer than the sound produced by the bow.
Be free to make your own marks with pencil, but remember that the marks on your bow have been printed for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of women in the market forced the terrified king Louis XVI, his two small children (Marie Therese, eleven, and Louis Charles, four) and the sister of the king, Madame Elizabeth, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob that shouted and threatened against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
In a certain moment, a participant in the revolt smacked the head of a royal executioner in Versailles in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The own people of the Philippines paid for the war expenses of the imperialism of the United States of America.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of raising the majority of the interest and principal of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the government of the Philippines in the banks of Wall Street.
From now on, the super profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the principal gains of the American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the circumstances that gave rise to their establishment.
The European period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, between the 10th, 11th, and 12th centuries (i.e., between the years 1000 and 1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages.
The deterministic technology concept comprises, pragmatically, a great range of ideas, from the impetus or imperative technology to a strict sense that there is a logical underlying that drives the fate of humanity and is related to the laws of science and how they are manifested in technology.
Most of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: that the development of technology in itself is independent of any influence from cultural or political factors and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one could argue that the existence of cars inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, a national highway network is not feasible economically for a small volume of cars, so new techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The use of automobiles also leads to a higher rate of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in Romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geography molded people and, with the passage of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, in harmony with the location of that society, were preferred to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is known as the capital of fashion today, Constantinople was considered to be the capital of fashion in the European Middle Ages.
His fame as a center of luxury began approximately 400 BC and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century his status declined, mainly due to the fact that, on his return, the Crusaders brought gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the goods offered in the markets of the Byzantine Empire.
The title of «capital of fashion» was transferred, from Constantinople, to Paris.
The pinnacle of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and the 13th centuries.
In the beginning, the clothing style was heavily influenced by the culture of the Byzantine Empire in the east.
Because of the slow communication channels, styles of western medicine may be delayed by an average of 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had developed a distinctive style of its own. One of the most significant developments of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to abroach their clothes.
Self-sufficiency agriculture is a form of subsistence farming in which farmers produce enough food for themselves and their families.
Agriculture of subsistence is a simple practice, generally organic, that combines the use of seeds originating from the region ecologically with the rotation of crops or other methods comparatively simple to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many countries in developing countries.
Cultural subcultures gather individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by the standards of society and gives them the chance to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish the subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location, or gender of their members.
Characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, religious, or political, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to this subculture by using distinctive and symbolic styles, gestures, and jargon.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for gratifying the importance of sociabilization is to analyze the few and unfortunate cases of children who, by neglect, abuse, or intentional neglect, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are called «savages». Some children are confined by people, in general their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the child's severe disabilities.
It is possible that aboriginal children may have experienced traumatic or abusive childhood.
It is said that some were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, he exhibits behaviors (within his physical capabilities) almost identical to that of the specific animal that cared for him, as well as his fear or indifference towards people.
Even though the project-based learning approach should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, the andamiage goes a bit further.
The framework is not a learning technique; it is, rather, an assistance that provides support to those who are new to a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The andamiage can be either real or virtual; to say it in another way, a teacher is a kind of andamio, but also is the small paper clip on Microsoft Office.
Virtual andamiages are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate, or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student alone.
Children are welcomed into homes of care by a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and, even, extortion.
No child should have to grow up, never, in an environment in which he does not have love, care and education; but happens.
We can perceive that the family-based foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The aim of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, caring, loving, and supportive tutors, medical care, and educational assistance.
The aim of foster care is to provide all the needs that were not being met in the child's home.
Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different traits that the Internet presents open the door to new dimensions from the perspective of reward and reward systems.
For example, it is pointed out that learning and socialization are significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), user reactions to web sites were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of facial microexpressions, which are movements in the face of only a few milliseconds in duration.
Specifically, it is assumed that by reading microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The Discourse of the President, explained the way in which those unable to comprehend speech due to a brain injury, can, no matter how accurately, evaluate sincerity.
Even suggests that human abilities to interpret human behaviour can be shared with domestic animals, such as dogs.
Through the investigations of the twentieth century it has been shown that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifested.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes that variation.
Segregation and recombination may vary between one generation and the next.
In the savanna, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy his nutritional needs with the resources of the plants of which he disposes.
It is more, not doing it carries serious health risks: delayed growth, malnutrition and, in the worst case, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have constituted the source of easily digestible plant resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and contain a great number of proteins that contain all of the essential amino acids.
In other words, we should not be surprised if our own forebears solved their protein problems in the same way that chimpanzees of the savanna do today.
The interruption of sleep consists of deliberately awakening during the normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
It can be achieved easily by using a louder alarm clock that doesn't wake him up completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options that rely on the biological rhythm consist in drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, known to be a diuretic) before going to bed, which will force him to urinate in the morning.
The level of peace inside a person is directly related to the amount of tension in their body and in their spirit.
As low as the tension is, the more positive is the force of life with which we are blessed. Each of us has the potential of finding peace and happiness absolutas.
All of us can achieve enlightenment. The only barrier to enlightenment is our negativity and tension.
If well the bases of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they were extended by the love Mahayana and numerous techniques of the Indian yoga tradition.
In general terms, the laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that covers everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment) is activated with yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga.
The cooperation between the USSR and the United States was the result of facing a common enemy, Nazi Germany, during World War II. Terminated the war, the clashes of system, process, and culture ended by separating the two countries.
At two years from the end of the war, the allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for 40 years, and would be fought in the following 40 years, and would be fought through militaries substitutes, in battles from Africa to Asia, through many other sites.
Because the Polish defence was already broken, his only hope was to retreat and regroup in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800 000 Red Army soldiers invaded and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, infringing the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, bilateral and multilateral agreements, bilateral and multilateral treaties, international agreements, international treaties, international agreements, international treaties, international agreements, international treaties, international agreements, international treaties, international agreements, international treaties, international agreements, international treaties, international agreements, international treaties
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
From time immemorial, the function of the navy has been to guarantee that his country maintains the right to transport its people and goods, while, at the same time, it interferes with the capacity of the enemy to do the same.
The Atlantic campaign in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of it.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, tried to destroy this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have taken control of Britain, as they did with the rest of Europe.
Allegedly, sheep were domesticated, for the first time, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran, about 10,000 years ago.
With the purpose of obtaining easily their milk, meat, skins, and fur, the ancient tribes and peoples started stealing them.
For the most part, domestic sheep were gathered in flocks that wandered through the hills or other areas of grazing, often cared for by children or teenagers. These methods of grazing are still in use today.
In England, the railways had been installed by the mid-sixteenth century.
Though the rails of the wagons were made of simple planks of wood, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve a greater speed and carry heavier loads than on the rough roads of the day.
The incorporation of railroad ties to keep the rails in their place was quite early. However, gradually, they came to realize that the railroad rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron in their upper part.
It became a common practice, although the iron wagon wheels wore out faster than the wooden wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and, in 1767, iron wheels began to be used.
The first form of transportation known was walking.
His predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
If bipedalism has been found in fossils of australopithecines from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs about 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, join environmentalist movements, or, even, we can become activists and fight to ameliorate, in some way, the suffering of tomorrow.
It is, in many cases, like the asymptomatic treatment. But if it is only a temporary situation, we should try to find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is manifest that the world has suffered great changes, due to the advancements of technology and science of mankind, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, a draft written by hand and signed by the president of the House of Representatives, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to the printing press of John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
They were made, during the night, between 150 and 200 copies, which are now known as the Dunlap Copies.
He was John Nixon who read the document for the first time and read it in the Independence Hall lawn, on July 8th.
The letter was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on 9 July.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which is known to still exist, are the oldest known copies of the document. The original manuscript is believed to have been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live today. They are the birds.
Many people don't realize them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are still many characteristics in birds that still resemble the dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and clawed hands, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate on the manipulation of data in the binary system.
A binary number only has two possible values, they are the 0 and the 1 and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
The internal poisoning may not be apparent immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common for a diagnosis to be immediate.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be found in finding a bottle of poisoned medicine or chemical products open.
Read the label to obtain specific information about the appropriate first aid information for that specific poison.
The entomologists employ the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word is derived from their former relationship with chinches, a species that is very developed to parasitize humans.
Cockroaches and bed bugs are nest-dwelling insects; they are adapted to live in the nest of their host.
More than 400 000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. have been reported, making it the most common neurological disorder among adults aged 20 to 44.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve, is the target of attack by multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicated that women have twice as many chances of developing EM than men.
A couple could conclude that raising a baby would not be the most appropriate for them or for the baby.
These couples could potentially choose to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the use of the scientific method.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of naturalists and philosophers was placed on the works of classical authors; especially, on the Latin translation of the Bible.
The thoughts of Aristotle, in particular the issues of science, even psychology, were accepted.
As the dominance of the Greek language waned, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophical and scientifically.
Frequently, many rhythms present in biological and behavioral processes depend on deeply rooted internal clocks and their production through internal watches.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to regular external stimuli, have been documented in almost all living things, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a period of self-sustaining oscillation free from external stimuli.
One of the key indicators of that DNA consisted in a material of type genetic was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterial cell using fags, or viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fago with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether it involves germline cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only germline mutations can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wildlife and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks, and studying of information about the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, take photographs, and learn about the orangutans in Borneo.
Each morning, people leave small villages in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross paths with other people whose jobs are in the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected with a transportation system based on the use of private automobiles, and they support it.
Currently, scientists hold that global carbon economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
All of them are part of society and use public transportation systems; and most of them complain about them.
In developed countries, it is not uncommon to hear complaints about the quality of drinking water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the cause of such complaints and why are they so frequent and why are they occurring daily? Are engineers of transportation simply incapable? Or is something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individuals and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not easy to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make exact predictions about the driving behavior of drivers.
Thankfully, there is a trend among drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to have a consistent logical consistency and can be represented mathematically approximate.
With the aim of making the flow more graphically clear, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Those relationships facilitate both planning and design, as well as the operations of the traffic control devices.
The first birds to fly were insects. This helped them evade their enemies more effectively and find food and a mate more easily.
The vast majority of insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings backwards, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This provides them with a wider range of possible hiding places from predators.
Currently, the dragonflies and caddisflies are the only insects incapable of folding their wings.
Miles of years ago, a man named Aristoteles said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to have some sense, do you agree?
The Amazon River is the largest and second largest river in the planet.
The Amazon River is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
The total amount of water from the rivers of the world that flows into the oceans, 20% of the world's water, derives from the Amazon River.
The great Amazon River has an extension of 6387 kilometers (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, never surpassing the Great Pyramids of Guiza, nor in size nor in sublime technique of construction.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their forebears, dating back to more than a thousand years ago.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population density in the world.
The Italian language is used in the Vatican, both for drafting its legislation and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by the majority of those who work within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The entirety of the citizens living in the Vatican adhere to the Roman Catholic Church.
Chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known from antiquity, as they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is formed by a combination of one or several of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It guarded greater similarity with the matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only that, at the same time, it had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, essentially, a combination of two or more metals. Recall that the periodic table has many metals.
Minerals are considered metals.
It is also possible that there may be small amounts of other elements, such as carbon, that are not metals.
Everything in the Universe is made up of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Because of this, when the pencil was invented, it won many friends.
Unfortunately, due to the implementation of new writing methods, pencils are less used and have lost their status.
Today, people write messages on computer screens. They do not need to, even, approach a pencil sharpener.
What will become of the keyboard when something new emerges?
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to form a nuclear core with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when you roll a heavy cart up a hill.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to decay with a minimal or no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The cortex has a thickness of about 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It is thinner under the moons of the plains and thicker under the mountains.
It is possible that there may be more oceans on the near side due to their thinner crust, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Theories of content focus on what attracts or appeals to people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that are internalized as they grow up until reaching maturity.
These theories analyze what causes people to want things they do and what factors in their surroundings force them to do certain things.
Two widely known theories are Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and Hertzberg’s two-factor theory.
On the other end of the spectrum is the attempt to continue to be one of the boys (or girls).
To managers of this category it is difficult to take decisions that fall badly with employees, impose discipline, perform performance reviews, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from employees.
In the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes he needs to modify everything the group has done so far and do it to his own way.
At the end of the day, the leader is the one responsible for the team's success and failure.
This form of behaviour often ends up alienating the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional computers also apply to virtual machines, although there are a few small differences.
Members of a virtual team often operate as a point of contact for their nearest physical group.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones that, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) constitutes also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The invisible team is the group in charge of the management and each member reports to them.
Why would an organization submit to the demand of establishing an organization of learning? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to stimulate innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and inventiveness.
Product of it, it is possible that the process of an organization working in a team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process to address the needs of the customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, the leadership must first create a culture of innovation, as well as a knowledge sharing and an organizational learning environment.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement approach as a method used by organizations to achieve greater level of performance.
The neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. Reduce, therefore, the field of inquiry and give it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavioral disorders contributes to the research of scientists.
Since a long time it has been known that several types of brain damage, injuries, and diseases affect brain function and cause behavioral changes.
Thanks to the advancement of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and investigate brain processes that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which enables us to gain a better understanding of the mental processes.
If AI is associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of computer science, which deals with the intelligence, learning, and adaptation of machines.
The investigation in the field of Artificial Intelligence is the development of machines with intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, capacity to respond to diagnoses and consultations of clients, as well as recognition of facial, writing, and voice.
These questions have become disciplines separated, focused on solving real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economy, medicine, engineering, and military, as well as in video games and personal computers.
School trips are a major part of every classroom.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours. The students can observe the exhibits in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while seated with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion also is an excellent way to reflect on an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of Bennet High School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the State and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions of the website are preserved in the form of an album of memories.
Blogs can also contribute to improving the writing of students.
Because students tend to be the readers who most criticize, the writer of blogs starts working to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging demands that students be more understanding of the world that surrounds them.
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages learners to deepen their learning beyond the typical day in school.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and they can establish their perspectives on specific topics.
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the current affairs of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located further south and north of the Great Lakes.
All these aspects, among other things, are the things that make Ontario unique to the eyes of the foreigners.

Below the bridge, there is a free space of 15 meters and, unlike the rest of the bridge, it was not completed until August 2011.
The full functionality of the bridge is expected to be restored in September 2017, when customs clearance procedures in Brazil are expected to be completed.
The area that now constitutes the eastern part of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guaraní people, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as hunter-gatherers, as well as practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chacoan region housed other indigenous peoples, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered, and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, before known as «The Great Province of the Indies», was born in the sixteenth century, as a result of the encounter between the Spaniards and the indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards gave the start to the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since that Asunción was established, in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous identity and culture.

It is virtually impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside of the archipelago, therefore, procure to do so before you depart.
Because Montevideo is located in the south of Ecuador, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures exceeding +30° C during the summer.
The winter weather can be deceptive: although it is very rare for temperatures to fall below freezing, wind and humidity interact to make it appear colder than the temperature actually marks.
There are no specifically «rainy» or «dry» seasons.
If many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wildlife is not domesticated, so it is not necessary to feed it or disturb it.
According to the park authorities, you must maintain at least 100 yards/meters from the bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals.
Without prejudice to how man-so they may appear, the bison, the uapatíes, the alces, the osos and virtually all the large animals can be aggressive.
Thousands of visitors suffer injuries each year from not keeping a safe distance from the animals. These animals are large, wild, and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
In addition, remember that smells attract wild animals and other wild animals, so it is important to avoid having or cooking food that releases a lot of odor and keep the cleanliness in the camp.
