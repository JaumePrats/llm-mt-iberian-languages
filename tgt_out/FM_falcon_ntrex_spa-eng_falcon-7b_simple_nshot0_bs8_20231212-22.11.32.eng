To the Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM, for its acronym in English) we are concerned about “appearing muppets”
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament for Wales (MPW, for its acronym in English).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly of Wales to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Member of the Labour Party declared that his group was concerned “that it would remain with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Assembly of the Party of Wales commented that all his group was “dissatisfied” and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was “open” to changing its name, but noted that the jump from pronunciation of MWP to muppet was “small”.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the change of name, declares: “Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves”.
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that revealed a broad support for calling the Welsh Assembly to the Parliament.
On the question of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the option MWP got the most support in a public consultation.
Apparently, the Members of the Assembly are suggesting alternatives, but the fight to reach a consensus could bring down the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the draft law on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will have the last word in the question of how they should be called when the Assembly deliberates on the legislation.
The Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether the name of their country is going to change to “Republic of Macedonia of the North”.
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed his candidacy for accession to the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent due to the difficulties of churches in Harlem
“Historically, the people I’ve talked to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner.”
“Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.”
He said that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way”, affirms.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbors go regularly.”
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that “at some point, they will return to the starting point”.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the type of people who won't help the churches that are left in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and, therefore, they will accelerate the closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these apartments will be members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in 1880.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that offered worship acquired the building.
A black congregation took control of St. Martin's, under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building gravely damaged and, while the parishioners of Father Johnson were making plans for its reconstruction, they also ordered the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of the Father Johnson in San Martín, was proud to call his campaigns “the campaigns of the poor”.
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church carillon, the largest one, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that San Martín did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in the last months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the rector of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on their concern that the diocese “try to pass the costs” to the parish council, although it had not participated in the contracting of the architects and the contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was bitten by a shark while diving for abalone in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on Saturday, the first day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, so he swam over with a group to pull him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was “screaming that he had been bitten
he had his clavicle broken
“I told everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark”, added Hammel.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented in a press conference that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks before, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper part of the chest.
The authorities closed the access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's Beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's beauty plans drive UK beauty market
Sainsbury's buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the aisles of their style and beauty stores.
In order to give a significant boost to the beauty market in the United Kingdom, valued at 2800 billion pounds and with a growth that is increasing in comparison with the fall in sales of fashion and household goods, the largest beauty halls in the country will be put to the test in 11 shops and, if they succeed, the same will be done in more shops the following year.
The investment in beauty arrives at the same time that this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be dedicated to televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's declared that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup line with a majority of products respectful of animals, something that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, in the perfumery The Fragrance Shop will try out its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, in the south of London, last week. The second will open in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later this year.
The online shops and the change towards the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local shops oblige the supermarkets to try to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores will become more like shopping centres while the supermarket chain tries to combat the discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount stores in hundreds of stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is considered that this has boosted food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt of the chain of supermarkets to renew its departments of beauty and pharmacy was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement about how to divide the profits from the drugstore products in their supermarkets.
The new strategy is being considered after the sale of the 281 pharmacy stores of Sainsbury to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It is pointed out that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding a wider range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to create an environment that enhances the shopping experience for our customers."
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to offer advice.
Our offer of brands is designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is “furious” after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, went “furious” after Holly Willoughby broke a 11 million pound contract with his lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and accessories Truly.
This business had compared with the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Peter Jones, the star of Dragon’s Den, by pulling out of her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was “furious” when the girl of gold of the television admitted that its new agreements, valued at up to 1.5 million pounds, did not leave time to dedicate itself to Truly, its fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday in the headquarters of its business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared with the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow and it was profiled as favorite to double the fortune of Willoughby, of some 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, aged 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As commented by a consulted source: “Truly was, by far, the main priority of Holly.
It would have been her long-term future, which would have kept her in the next two decades.
His decision to abandon left everyone involved totally stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at the Marlow headquarters, ready to be put on the market.
Experts believe that the exit of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment in products such as cushions and candles to clothing, and, possibly, delay even more his launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, who is 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40 % stake in the television production company of Baldwin.
Willoughby is going to become an ambassador for Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that last night “we didn’t talk about business issues”.
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
About the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some consider “unpresidential” and for being so positive about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Why has President Trump renounced so many things?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of “news presenter”.
“I haven’t renounced anything.”
He signaled that Kim is interested in meeting with him after Trump encomiased the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the principal diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, explained to the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate” response from the United States to its first steps toward the disarmament of North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out, the United States continue to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
The perspective of Trump was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
“We get along great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.”
They would have died millions of people.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: the end of missile tests, help for the release of hostages and bringing back the remains of U.S. soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach to speaking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but this way, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium full, we’d have about 200 people right here,”
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was reported to foreign NGOs that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 % of the population of Lombok had to be displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for international aid to be mobilized.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” explains Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will be sent to Palu, they still do not know if the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, explained that the authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Taking into account that the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami refuges have been built in Aceh, there are not many in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami sirens in Palu, even though there was a warning in advance, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, traveling from one island of Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the new disaster area.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the dilapidated infrastructure of Indonesia the central axis of his electoral campaign, and has allocated quite a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is facing a reelection next year.
In addition, he must face the persistent pressures of sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equalizes the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal when the score was 1-0.
He put the ball on his left foot and kicked it to the second post.
The action was sent over the area and went towards the upper right corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell into the net.
“I was trying to get into that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible”, said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kante was approaching and I gave him a tap. I didn’t think about it too much, I just threw the ball.”
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The mediapunta of the Blues made a tacón pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning and making a regate near the middle of the field and entering the field of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran quickly in the middle of the field.
After that, he made a nice pass to Hazard, who took it to the area.
Hazard was in front of the defense and he shot the ball to the second post with a left-footed shot that Alisson Becker, from Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, the Liverpool plays against the Napoli in the phase of groups of the Champions League. The match will be celebrated in the San Paolo Stadium, in Naples (Italy).
On the other hand, Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunami that occurred in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the emergency agency of the country at first hour of Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of the buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and that triggered waves of up to six meters, according to the spokesman of the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
The police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder of a woman after she was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, in John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who may have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us."
In addition, I would recommend to any person, especially to taxi drivers, that they have been able to capture something in dashcam that contact with us, since they can have vital information for our investigation”.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is in progress and the police have informed that they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police say no one can get in or out of the building.
He was left speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Now, it is informed to the residents that they will be allowed to enter again in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in the place in tears.
Doesn’t stop repeating “it’s terrible”.
At two o'clock, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon, controlling the block of flats.
We are looking for any person who has information to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on the number 0800 555 111, registration number 247 from the 30th of September.
The statue of Oliver Cromwell of the Parliament becomes the last commemorative success by “rewriting history”
Her prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this destruction of so many cultural and religious objects and artifacts in England carried out by her fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described the suggestions of Mr. Crick as a “madness” and an “attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster would become a target.”
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice the wrong Cromwell to the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and of part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than at present, a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If it is a completely accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has given shape to the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated.
A killer pig attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in the southwest of China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his last name “Yuan”, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui, in the province of Guizhou, as the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It seems that he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that in the pigsty there was a great pig with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig weighing almost 250 kilos had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“The legs of my cousin were bloody and broken”, declared the cousin, whose name is Wu, to The Guiyang Evening News.
The images from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately an hour after.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan nor to his cousin.
A manager of the market informed The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It seems that the family of Yuan and the authorities of the market are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man gravely injured.
Ten years before, a pig of almost 295 kilos cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After pigs ate a rancher in Oregon in 2012, a rancher in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs aren't usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "disparator".
“They are only playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to do harm.
What you have to do is to have them the appropriate respect.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave strong rains in the southwest of the U.S.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern Mexico coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa caused gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, since Sunday at five in the morning (Eastern time) and it was located almost 620 kilometers to the southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low-pressure systems are starting to form, which are moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will start to push the intense tropical rains northward, towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimetres of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical downpour collides with the low pressure system that is approaching, there will be widespread heavy precipitation in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause precipitation of almost between 5 and 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Expect between 5 and 10 inches of rain in parts of the southwest, especially in the greater part of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, it is possible that there may be sudden floods with conditions that worsen quickly.
Due to the threat of torrential tropical rains, it is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot.
The strong rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and the storms will cause strong winds and local dust storms.
The low pressures that are approaching will leave strong rains in specific parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible that the torrential rains leave almost two inches of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make the roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains of the region during the wet season.
Some tropical storm remnants will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rain becomes widespread by late Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rains will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, it will be possible to observe some intense temperature changes in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this implies drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen in the center of the U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and, Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of the summer will try to recover and expand again.
In a large part of the center and east of the United States, it is expected that the beginning of October will be warm, with general temperatures that will range from 26 degrees in the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, in New York, temperatures could reach up to 26 degrees, 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern half of the U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly happening in the 1980s, gave their testimonies on Thursday in six television networks.
At the same time, the political situation was at a standstill, and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest news from Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake, for the FBI to carry out an investigation for a week.
Ford informed the Judicial Committee of the Senate that she has the absolute certainty that Kavanaugh groped her in a state of drunkenness and that he tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely sure that that hadn't happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen's Friday report have seen it.
The company counted the audience for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not available immediately for other channels that retransmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems to calculate how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it's a crowd similar to that of an American football playoff game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, fueled the channel leader, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a hearing that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC occupied the second place, with 3,26 millions of viewers.
The CBS had 3,1 millions, the NBC had 2,94 millions, MSNBC had 2,89 millions and the CNN had 2,52 millions, commented Nielsen.
After the hearing, there was still a great interest.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning the CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
While receiving these reproaches, retransmitted in real time by the CNN, he was abashed.
“Looking at my face”, said a woman.
“Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?”
And he continued: “you have power when there are so many women who don’t have it”.
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would tell more things in his appearance before the Commission.
The cable and broadcast television networks aired everything in real time hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to propose the candidacy of Kavanaugh to the Senate to vote on it.
However, Flake said that he would only do it if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, the Democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake took his decision.
The decision of Flake was fundamental, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “making politics” with Brexit
Theresa May, the British prime minister, accused her critics of “playing politics” with the future of Britain and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
The first British prime minister, Theresa May, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference that will be held in Birmingham (United Kingdom) on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, affirming that a proposal for the UK and the EU to collect the other’s tariffs was “totally absurd”.
Assassination of Wayde: the police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and jailed for a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made public a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found DNA of Simpson on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say that he admitted having shot Wayde.
A bail bond of $350,000 has been set, according to the defense.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court released a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the crime laboratory of the Louisiana State Police, the Southern University Police and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director deportivo de LSU, thanked the police forces of the area for their “diligence and search for justice”.
Sims had 20 years.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had obtained an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team is “devastated” and “shocked” by the death of Wayde Sims.
“These are the things that people always worry about”, said Wade.
A volcano throws ash in Mexico City
Smoke coming from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center registered several tremors and shakes.
In social networks, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
The geophysicists have observed a greater activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers to the southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
The police face separatists in Catalonia before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after protesters clashed with anti-riot police while tens of thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's divisive independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the riot police, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally filled with tourists.
There were also confrontations in the following hours and the police used truncheons to contain the fight.
During several hours, the independentist groups, with messages like “no forget, no forgive”, faced the unionist demonstrators, shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1, 2017, referendum, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters elected by a crushing majority the independence, although the participation was low, since the people who were against the secession boycotted the referendum in great measure.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote at polling stations throughout the region, where there were violent confrontations.
The groups in favor of the independence camped on Friday night to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we lived one of our best moments.”
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to vote, but now we're stuck.
Despite achieving a vital victory in the December regional elections, the procatalanista parties have fought to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense”, declared.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“To be a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in the democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government”, he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a house in Londonderry with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday evening at around 19:30 in Ballynagard Crescent.
The inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there were damages in the accesses and in the building itself.
At some point, it is possible that the car has been shot with a crossbow.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for the Livingston assured the victory
A Livingston promotion impressed Rangers as Steven Gerrard suffered his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack marked the difference. Gary Holt's team went up a place, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard's team have yet to win a game away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points' advantage.
Before the Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends its winning streak in the division to six games. Holt, the head coach, still hasn't tasted defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lets pass opportunities in front of a tough opponent
The Holt team had to have gone a step ahead much earlier, causing all kinds of problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the goal. After that, Alan Lithgow's shot was deflected after entering the field to score the header of Craig Halkett in front of the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with the ball at their feet.
This is how the decisive goal arrived.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston looked for an entry, with a combined play of Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
In that moment, Rangers dominated the possession, but could not pass the defense of the host and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
The game continues until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save by Kelly.
Allan McGregor, goalkeeper of Rangers, rejected a shot from Scott Pittman with a kick, and Lithgow was far from another play of Livingston.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly coming in, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one after a Halkett header on the substitute Glenn Middleton and the other after a handball.
“Fenomenal” of Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A fantastic performance and a fantastic result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an upward trajectory.
His style of play and his formation have hardly changed since his promotion, but this is largely down to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was huge and directed a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to enter the opponent's field once, which is a call to attention to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Colonia
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of the Turkish President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have been discussing issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Colonia to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Also, hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, much of them Kurds, condemned both the policies of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Accident on Deptford High Street: cyclist dies after colliding with a car
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare to the east of the city, at 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended by the paramedics, but he died there.
The accident happened after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene in Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and it has been advised to drivers to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six agents injured after disturbances
Six prison officers have been injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the director of the prison.
The disturbances started in the prison of Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and still continue.
Specialists of an elite team (called “Tornado”) are in charge of controlling the fights, in which eight internees are involved, which affect a ward.
The agents received assistance for light facial injuries in the place.
A spokesman for the prison service says: “Specialist staff have been deployed to deal with the incident at Long Lartin prison.”
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons we do not tolerate violence and make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.
The prison of Long Lartin accommodates more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison had received medical assistance in hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, agents of the anti-disturbance squad were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which the prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the arid areas could be benefited)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for parts of Arizona, Nevada, Utah and California, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will drive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix commented in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had maintained their status as a tropical storm or depression within a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950."
In 1967, the hurricane Katrina approached almost 65 kilometers from the border of Arizona.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of torrential rains, which can reach up to 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollón Escarpment, in Arizona.
It is likely that they will fall between 2 and 5 inches of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 inches in isolated areas, in other areas of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that do not run the risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rains are considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that part of these torrential rains will be beneficial due to the drought conditions that are currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering, at least, extreme drought, the second most severe category, as reported by weather.com.
In the first place, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which by Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving towards the north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
So, it is expected that it will rain in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon of Monday.
There is a risk of torrential rains in some parts of Mexico, which run a considerable risk of flooding.
“Se are expected torrential rains of between 7 and 15 centimeters from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 25 centimeters.”
After that, Rosa will head north towards Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the border of Arizona in the early morning of Tuesday as a tropical depression. Later, it will move south towards Utah by the end of the night of Tuesday.
“The main danger of Rosa or its remains is the strong torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert.”, according to the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00pm on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the area of Radstock, in Avon, according to the Police of Somerset.
The agents have made an appeal to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the despicable tactics and unfair treatment of the Democrat Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has “suffered the meanness and the anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
In addition, Ford testified in the session about this accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, the “American people saw the shrewdness, the quality, and the courage” of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our day, a jurist with an admirable record of service to the public.”
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.”
I didn’t show up, but I did run the race.
“That’s why I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump alleged that the Democrats are embarked on a mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
It is expected that the first procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court will take place no later than Friday, according to a high-ranking Republican official at the CNN.
Hundreds of dead in a quake and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number is increasing
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the enormous waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and a tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday night when waves of up to six meters arrived at the coast at night, dragging many to their death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When it was announced yesterday that there could be a tsunami, people were still on the beach and didn’t leave immediately, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, for its Indonesian acronym) in a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it destroyed everything that was on the ground”, said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken bridges and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in a zone with 2,4 millions of people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT, for its Indonesian acronym) informed in a press release that the energy released by the great earthquake of Friday was 200 times greater than the energy released by the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
He added that the geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damages as “serious” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to what he said, they found bodies of some victims trapped under the debris of the destroyed buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho pointed out that the number of victims and the damage could be greater along the 300 km of coast to the north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications “were totally paralyzed and there was no information” from Donggala, commented Nugroho.
“More than 300,000 people live there”, said the Red Cross in a press release, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not informing about the tsunami that had hit Palu, although the authorities claim that the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social networks, you can hear a man who was on the last floor of a building warning people in the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a great blackout that cut off communications in the surrounding areas of Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, declare the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic products.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for rescue and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centers of Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
It's very bad.
Although the staff of World Vision in Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees are sheltering under tarpaulins installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating scene on their way, affirmed the Mr. Doseba.
“They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as the aid groups put their gears in motion, some people were lamenting that it was not being allowed the movement of experienced cooperators to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign aid, supplies and deployment of foreign personnel can be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a catastrophe at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government says that it considers it a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but that hasn’t happened yet.”
After the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing still had the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the stories that write the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small child was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the national paragliding team of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“For my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional load”, commented.
Mr. Gendon remembered how, in the hours that followed the dissemination of the news that the hotel Roa Roa had collapsed in the community of parapente, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival that was taking place on the beach.
However, his messages only showed a verification mark in grey, not two in blue.
“I think that means that the messages weren’t delivered”, said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, some thieves robbed an employee of Brink who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a cash machine located in the center of entertainment and was preparing to recharge it with more money, wrote the detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While I was busy, another man “came running from behind the Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money destined for reloading.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspicious people leaving the place, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at the number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will start to call himself Ye.
Kanye West announced the change in Twitter on Saturday: “The person previously known as Kanye West”.
It's been a long time since West, 41 years old, was called Ye, the name he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Replacing the singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance due to “emotional reasons”, as commented by the creator of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious importance for him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, which means ‘you’”, commented West in the beginning of this year while talking about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it means us.
He went from being Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
One of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
An old collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital or small letters, with or without a guion.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, president-elect of Mexico, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that he is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that “he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico”.
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when student movements were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving them monthly stipends to study and opening more free public universities.
He affirmed that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U. S. should double its funding for I. A.
Now that China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, investor and professional of I. A. who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after the announcements of several parts of the U.S. Government, even when, in general, the U.S. does not have an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
“Duplicating the budget for research on I. A. would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the U.S. We have our eyes on the next step in the field of I. A.”, says Lee.
The doubling of funding means the doubling of the chances that the next great achievement in I. A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishing house, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most important I. A. companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on a system that defeated the best American player of Othello. Later, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized the previous technological competitions of the U.S. government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers have to work very hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that’s taking the leaders of academia; it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
In the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired top graduates from the universities to work in I. A.
Lee commented that some changes in U.S. immigration policy could also help to intensify U.S. initiatives in I. A.
“I think that doctors in I. A. should have automatic permanent residency cards,” he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) funds people from academic institutions equally as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the Department of Defense of the United States established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract industrial and academic partners. On the other hand, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a new initiative called AI Next.
As far as the National Foundation for Science is concerned, it currently invests more than 100 million USD per year in research on I. A.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not carried out any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum if they are going to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday on whether their name will be changed to “Republic of Macedonia of the North”, a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its candidacy for EU membership and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbor to the north is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the new name proposed, but the nationalists argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, the majority in the country.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the participation will reach the 50 % minimum required for the referendum to be considered valid.
On the ballot for the referendum was the following question: “Are you in favor of the accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all”, said Olivera Georgijevska, aged 79, in Skopie.
Although it will not be legally binding, many members of the Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote so that it will be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in the Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared that, at one o'clock, no irregularities had been notified.
However, the participation was only 16 %, compared with the 34 % of the last elections to the European Parliament held in 2016, when a 66 % of registered voters cast their vote.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe”, declared Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopie.
Zoran Zaev, prime minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote in the referendum of Macedonia on a change of name of the country that would open the way to NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament, in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from in front of the tents of the campaigners who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not by the back door,”
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If Macedonia does not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
The Prime Minister Zaev says that the accession to NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so much needs, whose unemployment rate is over 20 %.
“I believe that the majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO”, said Zaev after depositing his vote.
He said that a positive result would be a “confirmation of our future”.
In a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Public Policies, it was assured that between the 30 and the 43 % of the voters was going to participate in the referendum, which means a lower participation than the required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, of Macedonia, revealed that 57 % of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the 70 % said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, the participation must be of at least 50 % plus one vote.
In case of failure, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, evades the whole defense of Brighton to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart the defence of Brighton in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian midfielder received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three defenders of Brighton before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He evaded a defender before beating several more in the area of Brighton.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit it with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan with a shot that went to the right side of the goal.
“Agüero has some problems in his foot”, said Pep Guardiola, City’s coach, to the press.
“We are talking about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.”
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball inside the Brighton territory.
He made a beautiful pass to the left wing for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave some touches before directing Sterling towards the second post.
The forward of the Sky blues launched the ball to the net just before leaving the limits.
The City faces the Hoffenheim in a group stage match of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil the party for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer expects to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, still have chances in the playoffs.
The Rockies clinched at least a wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek their first division title.
“Even though we’re not playing for anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the fans of Denver will be excited and that the other team probably played at the highest level that I’ve faced this year.”
Why wouldn’t he want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it looks like they're leaning toward leaving Scherzer on the mound in that situation.
Scherzer, who will make his opening number 34, made a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The history of Washington's right-hander is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump gives a speech in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“In November everything is at stake.”
There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I do not present myself, but it is a race, so I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates,” he said.
And he continued: “We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.”
They are determined to recover the power by all means necessary, you can see the meanness, the wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control. And we’re not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are embarked on a mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
“We’ve seen it these last four days,” he said, saying that the Democrats “were furious, were bad, were horrible and false.”
He made reference to the Judicial Committee of the Senate nominating Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, What?
No, no mmm, I'm waiting for a response. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of opinions.
He is intolerant with people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Members of Parliament of the Labour Party who are told that they are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a treatment that is categorically against antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I was in disagreement with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe. It is ironic that Jeremy was in disagreement with leaders on issues on which he was in disagreement with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
During the greater part of the eight years that I have been a member of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been like.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a “more friendly and compassionate” policy has already been forgotten, if it was ever really applied in any way.
It is becoming more and more clear that differing opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged in terms of whether the leaders of the party consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to change his views radically and to adopt positions with which he had never been in agreement, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but they never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each motion “of censure” or each change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more narrow.
In the last two years, I have received many advices that recommended me to keep my head down and not to make myself heard too much and that way “I would be fine”.
But I haven't got into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my secondary school in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, not even in the last elections.
It is impossible that someone in Nottingham East did not know my political positions nor the areas in which I did not agree with the current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday is that I don't understand this urge to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunistic politics will prevent me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: un Ayr invicto sube a la cima
Two late tries at the end of the game may have decided the final result, but, without doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining game of the Tennent’s Premiership.
Now they lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten that participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of its defense, as well as its ability to take advantage of better opportunities, which gave the victory to the local team, so that the coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
“We’ve been put to the test in all the games and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy.”
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: “The Ayr deserve the recognition, they took their chances better than us”.
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card shown to Ayr captain Rory Hughes, on loan from the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Climo increased the advantage of the Ayr with a penalty. Before, just in the middle of the half, he scored and converted a solo try, which left the score at 17-5 in favor of the Ayr in the break.
However, the Melrose started well in the second part and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
After there was a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, and, when the game resumed, Ayr took the lead with an attempt at goal by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
The yellow card given to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of the fact that they had one more man with a converted try by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for placating Climo without the ball, from the line of scrimmage, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul that was advancing.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry into the corner for his fifth shot at goal.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the sector of the restauration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the restaurant business after revealing that he has been named director of a chain of restaurants.
The actor of 56 years is Jack Jarvis in the famous program of the BBC, which writes and coprotagonizes with his partner of many years, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to make any comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “flourishing market of Glasgow’s restaurants”.
“The sea belongs to us”: a Bolivia without a coastline has the hope that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors guard a naval general headquarters in La Paz.
In the public buildings wave blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: “The sea belongs to us by right,
Recovering it is a duty.
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, they still remember vividly the lost coast before Chile in a bloody conflict over the resources that took place in the 19th century, as well as the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
It may be that these hopes are the greatest in decades, since Bolivia expects a resolution of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision”, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens spread throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has the obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is fighting a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about the resolution adopted on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The UN agency based in the Netherlands does not have the power to adjudicate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the resolution of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have actually hindered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration”, said Zárate.
In addition, he suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales has undermined any residual good will from Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talking, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain conversations after this.
The two countries do not exchange ambassadors since 1962.
The former Bolivian president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision would be unusually quick.
On Monday, Chile will offer Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “putting an end to 139 years of disputes with mutual benefits”, said.
In addition, Calzadilla denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political weapon.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean”, he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see what we have to leave behind.”
North Korea says it will not give up nuclear weapons unless it can trust the U.S.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, says that his nation will never be the first to denuclearize if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The United States was urged to fulfill the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the rival leaders.
Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be on the verge of resuming nuclear diplomacy talks with Kim Jong U, leader of North Korea.
Ri says that the continuation of the sanctions and the opposition of the U.S. to a declaration that ends the Korean War, is a “quimera”.
Washington is wary of accepting North Korea's declaration without Pyongyang making a significant disarmament move first.
Both Kim and the president of the U.S., Donald Trump, want to celebrate another summit.
However, there is a widespread skepticism about the seriousness of North Korea's renunciation of its nuclear arsenal, which the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo has planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The fashion parades of Paris reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land in a shop near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, don't look any further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that enveloped the heads of the models.
Other large accessories were pineapples with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation reminded me of a complete diving team, snorkel and goggles included, while another seemed like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're in luck.
The hunters of style predict that the enormous hats could start to be seen in the streets of shops.
The big hats are coming strong from the hand of “La Bomba”, with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimetres used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this impractical hat that flooded the social networks presented another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini that carried it.
The raffia bag in dark orange, decorated with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the La Riviera collection by Jacquemus for the spring-summer 2019 season in Paris Fashion Week.
As fashion stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories”.
John Edward: the linguistic competences are fundamental for the citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes achieved in the fields of sport, the arts, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for its acronym in English) strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools have for their object the preparation of their pupils for the continuation of their education, for the career they may choose and for the place they may occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted study plan, it is observed that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject in the centers.
As Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart.”
If you speak to him in his language, it reaches his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries, you can't depend only on English.
If we take into account the recent results of the exams of this year, we can observe that the languages are in the highest places of the classification tables, being the rates of approved more high in the independent schools.
In total, 68 % of the students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that make up the SCIS, showed that 72 % of the students obtained an A in mandarin, while 72 % of those who studied German, 69 % of those who studied French and 63 % of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support the teaching of foreign languages as a fundamental skill that children and young people will need in the future without a doubt.
In the current situation, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as the subjects CTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent schools and in all places.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the Commission for Employment and Skills in the United Kingdom revealed that, of the reasons given by employers on the difficulties they faced in filling vacancies, 17 % were attributed to a shortage of linguistic skills.
Therefore, the linguistic competences are becoming more and more indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
The possible employment opportunities that require languages are on the rise, which is why these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last their whole life.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to get ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 % of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. Moreover, it was established that the only foreign language spoken by a two-digit percentage, the 15 %, was French.
For this reason, investing in the teaching of languages now is important for today's children.
If you know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be better equipped to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the classical modern languages, while others will focus on the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools always be able to choose between several languages taught by specialist teachers in this matter.
Scotland’s independent schools dedicate all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children for life and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
In these times, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have an important role to play in the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered “competencies for international communication”.
The independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.

LeBron James debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for the fans who are waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
However, we still need to determine how many minutes he's going to play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48”, said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The reporter of the Lakers, Mike Trudell, published in a tweet that it was likely that James would play some limited minutes.
After a session of training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game preseason schedule of the Lakers.
“In this stage of my career, I don’t need preseason games to prepare myself,” he said.
Hora del mitin de Trump en West Virginia, canal de YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation of his candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court in waiting, Trump intends to obtain support for the next mid-term elections, since the Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see it online through a live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on this week's hearings of this week's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, which were tense due to sexual misconduct allegations and have left in limbo an expected vote on confirmation during, at most, a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of rallies is to help Republicans who are facing elections in November to gain momentum.
As such, the Trump campaign signaled that the five rallies next week are meant to “energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House,” according to Reuters.
“The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the campaign”, said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight’s meeting could attract sympathizers of “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as having coverage in the media of Pittsburgh,” as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come to give him a push in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the U.S. team shows that it is willing to fight to keep alive the hope of facing the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday may be what this Ryder Cup needs.
The oscillating pendulum of impulse is a completely invented concept, but the players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
Then, where would they say that the impulse is now?
“We had a six-point lead and now we have a four-point lead, so I guess you could say that’s a little bit of a boost,” said Jordan Spieth after the round.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points ahead with 12 more in play.
According to Spieth, Americans feel they have something going for them and plenty of reasons to be optimistic, among other reasons because of the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got four points out of four.
Jordan Spieth has been lethal off the tee and preaches with his example.
The guttural cries of celebration rose in volume as their round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth round when he and Thomas were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave the game to the US team in the 15th was received with a similar cry, those that transmit that the US team is not yet out of the game.
“What we need to do is redouble our efforts and concentrate on the game”, commented Spieth.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe has won four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple that didn’t make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and in the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That's the way they play and the way their energy flows with the noisy crowd makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there won't be any other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferiblemente, los dos al mismo tiempo en hoyos diferentes.
Even so, it is premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball in the morning, after forming a partnership with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not get out.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch up close because you can see the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big advantage going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the U.S. team is willing to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leads with a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the competition with two victories over a Tiger Woods who was in trouble, advancing four points in the classification of Le Golf National.
The European Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that committed many errors during the morning foursomes, which ended 3-1.
The U. S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but was unable to close the gap.
The American Jim Furyk needs to obtain eight points out of the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. In addition, he and Molinari, who received the nickname “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After losing to Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to beat a despondent Woods and a rookie American Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who in the two matches on Saturday did not stand out too much, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the fourballs in the morning, returned to be the partner of Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a result 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and tranquil in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They achieved an exciting victory 2-1 against Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4-3 in the foursomes after having lost the two initial holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has recovered from a four-point deficit in the individual matches only twice, but Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is “no possibility” of disarming first unilaterally if it does not have confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country renouncing its nuclear weapons unilaterally under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared before the General Assembly of the international organization that North Korea had adopted “important measures of goodwill” during the past year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile launches, dismantling the facilities for nuclear tests and committing itself to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we have not received any similar response from the United States.”
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of us disarming unilaterally.”
Although Ri repeated the well-known complaints of North Korea about the resistance of Washington to a formula of nuclear disarmament “by phases” that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, since he did not reject a unilateral nuclear disarmament, as North Korea has done in the past.
He made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between a U.S. president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the U.S. has said that Pyongyang must renounce its nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington has resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament in the first place and has increased the pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a declaration of termination of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of the people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our distrust.
Ri did not make any mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced with great fanfare by the U.S. president at the United Nations a few days ago.
Instead of that, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, the leader of South Korea, in the last five months, and added: “If South Korea had been the interested party in the denuclearization of the peninsula instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the peninsula would not be in such a stalemate”.
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from that of last year, when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct the missiles of North Korea towards US soil after Trump, in a suicidal mission, called Kim Jong-un “rocket man”.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, lauded Kim for his courage in moving toward disarmament, but said there was still much to do and that sanctions would have to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump affirmed that there was no established deadline for this: “We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its advances.
However, as the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, informed the Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue energetically and without non-compliance until we make reality the nuclear disarmament definitively and fully verified.”
The United Nations Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not well.
He went to Pyongyang in July saying that there had been advances, but a few hours later, North Korea denounced that its “demands were those of a mafioso”.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantling a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. took “corresponding measures.”
He said that Kim had communicated to him that the “measures” that he was looking for were the guarantees of security that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to sleep enough
Thanks to a new course that is being taught this year at Harvard University, all university students are trying to sleep more in an attempt to fight against the growing culture of studying all night drinking coffee.
A professor discovered that the students of the number one university in the world do not have any idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her last year.”
He said that no one had ever spoken to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is being taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts about how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students hardly slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, there is an image of a bedroom, where the students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
After, an icon of the campus with interactive icons animates the participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that it’s not going to change the students’ behavior immediately.”
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as any has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco.
He affirmed that the culture of pride for “staying up all night” still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good quality sleep should be “the secret weapon” of students to fight stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain generate a feeling of hunger, that’s why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after having attended one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
Wait until the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students think about putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so that they would end up having problems to go to sleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: the goal of Menga tumbles down the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when the attack of Dolly Menga drove the disarticulated team of Steven Gerrard to a defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
Rangers wanted to get their first win away from home since the 4-1 win at St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team beat them for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the Hearts, who are leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack took place just minutes before half-time and Rangers' lacklustre line-up was not up to the task at any point.
Now, the Rangers go down to the sixth position, the Livingston goes up to the third, behind the Hibernian by the goal difference.
The Rangers may have more problems, as the linesman Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance after apparently being hit by an object from the visitor's stand.
Gerrard changed eight of the eleven players who won the game against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup.
On the other hand, Holt took 11 players from Livingston who drew 1-1 with Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-organised team stifled their opponents throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored two minutes into the game, when Menga made a pass into the space for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the central midfielder sent it out.
Keaghan Jacobs made a foul in the deep for the captain Craig Halket, but his partner in the defense, Alan Lithgow, only managed to send it out by the long stick.
The Rangers recovered the control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson turned a deaf ear to the Colombian's request.
The Rangers got two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly barely had to break a sweat to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame effort.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston was against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a deep ball to Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed the ball to Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an immediate impact, as the volante passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block it.
Even so, Livingston continued to carry the visitors exactly towards the type of game that he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing the way with long passes.
Holt could have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow rounded off a corner that didn't go in.
The substitute for Rangers, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the “Sunday Morning” section: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and COUNTING... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which since then has become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film “Las campanas de Coronado”, with the actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of scientists cowboys:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, it’s used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: “It’s like a radio!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” the malignant cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” the malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
So, they can “see” a common protein in many cancers and re-inject it.
An essay on the vaccine is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a common protein found in many cancers, called HER2, and, subsequently, reinject the cells.
The professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, ´commented: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine”.
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer”, such as breast, ovary, lung or colorectal cancer, explained the professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancerous cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe in favor of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed off the set of Saturday Night Live after an erratic performance in which he praised President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he used the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Many times I speak with someone white and they ask me how I can like Trump if he’s racist.”
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
Saturday Night Live started the program with a sketch of Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in relation to the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of the West's tantrum to the social networks.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West said to the audience that he had a bad time on stage because he was wearing that hat.
They met me.
They told me not to go out with the hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me that I’m sleeping”, declared, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see me asleep?” and added that he “was going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant that no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to advance?”
Try with love.
His comments received boos from the audience at least twice, and the members of SNL seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: “The studio was completely silent.”
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he came out on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MASSES”.
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was “just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful”.
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying their music or their clothes, or supporting their art) who I consider is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.”
He is free.
We also,
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now he was “the person previously known as Kanye West”.
It's not the first artist who changes his name, following the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the disappeared legend of music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Cargo of attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
It is expected that the accused will appear in the Belfast District Court on Monday.
Fiscal review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31 years old, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those roles on screen often transmitted to young men that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes “something went wrong” and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit Harington, who recently got married to his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, also admitted that he thinks it’s “fairly important” to address this issue.
“Personally, I think it’s quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?”, he said.
“What have we been teaching men while they were growing up, thinking about the problems they see now?”
Kit thinks that television can have a part of the responsibility for the increasing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: “What is innate and what is taught?”
What is taught on television, and in the street, that makes young people feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is “tired of battlefields and horses”.
From November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
A few days ago, the actor revealed that he thinks knowing his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, it has given me to my future family and my life from now on”, he said.
Rose Leslie, who plays Ygritte, Jon Snow's love interest in the fantasy series Game of Thrones, won the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.
The couple got married in June 2018 in a farm of the family of Leslie, in Scotland.
VIH/sida: China informs of a 14 % more of new cases
China has announced an increase of 14 % in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country, there are more than 820,000 people affected, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were notified.
The majority of these were infected by sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread quickly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced in its entirety, declared the Chinese health authorities at a congress held in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGTB community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB community still suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have calculated that between 70 % and 90 % of the men who maintain sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases are by not using an adequate protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to antiretroviral drugs as part of an effort to confront the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data on Republican senators and says it’s “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Representative Maxine Waters criticized Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said that those accusations were driven by right-wing commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies”, commented Waters in a Twitter post.
Apparently, the information published included the addresses and phone numbers of the U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol published the information on the Internet during a session of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee.
The filtration was done at some point after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the posts was associated with Waters' office, and made public the data of a member of Waters' staff, according to the Capitol.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie”, continued Waters.
“The member of my personal staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.”
This allegation without foundation is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters's declaration sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including from the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Denies this information with anger”, wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that the necessary temperance for being a Member of Congress is lacking.”
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
Do not rebel.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must maintain calm and serenity.
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticisms of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of seeming too angry during his testimony on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who hopes to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very grave”, he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted “the appropriate authorities and the entities charged with the enforcement of the law” to these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the authors are discovered,” he continued, “and that they are considered legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all members of my staff.”
Critique of Johnny English: Again in action. The parody of the spy of Rowan Atkinson is short
Now it has become a tradition to look for guiños at the Brexit in any new movie with a British focus. It seems that this is what we should do with this new installment of the parodic action and comedy Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satire about how clearly ridiculous we are the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his license for the second time. Just his name already gives away that, more than anything else, it is a comedy created for non-English speaking territories.
Of course, it's the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange pretensions of squandering glamur, has a little of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that type that touched a single note in the theme of Carros de fuego that touched in the inauguration ceremony of the Olympic Games of London 2012.
In addition, in its origin it was based on the mysterious man traveler and international represented years ago by Atkinson in the forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last episode, there are one or two good moments.
I loved to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor while the rotors hit the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humor is a bit short, and is oddly superfluous, especially now that franchises like James Bond and Mission: Impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
The humor seems more directed to children than to adults, and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not so ingenious and accurate as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of actuality is that Great Britain is in serious problems.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the secret network of spies of Great Britain, revealing the identities of all its agents in active service before the consternation of the agent in service, a lamentably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the drop that fills the glass for the first minister, a pompous and cornered character who is seeing how his popularity is sinking: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to resort to one who is retired.
That has to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, although he gives extra-curricular lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy similar to School of Rock.
Bough is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets up with his former partner, Bough, reprised by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a captain of a submarine, a nice role for which he does not take advantage enough with Vicki Pepperdine.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, with the beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a charismatic billionaire from the world of technology who claims to be able to solve the problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a fancy French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Undoubtedly, they were used to the fullest in that last sequence, but, however funny and noisy it may be, the whole thing still transmits a somewhat childish sensation.
A fairly regular product.
Just like with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is working on a plan to have Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan with which the Britons would work four days a week, but they would earn five.
Apparently, the party wants the owners of the companies to allocate the savings obtained thanks to the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
So, the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea “would fit” in the plans and the economic agenda of the party to incline the country in favor of the workers.
This change to a four-day week has received the support of the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a high-ranking member of the Labour Party commented to The Sunday Times: We expect the announcement of a review of the directive before the end of the year.
“You can’t achieve it in one day, but the four-day work week is definitely a question that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the general industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this type of ideas, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, for the moment, not all of the Labour Party supports this decision.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day week is not part of the party's policy and will not be discussed at this time."
The shadow chancellor of the Exchequer, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to expound his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was willing to recover powers of "anonymous directors" and "abused" directors of companies that provide public services.
Among the plans of the minister in the shadow also includes the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover all their participation, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond with the irregularities perceived.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and create inclusive investment funds in which 10 % of the shares of the private sector companies would have to be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak on "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and if it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed at least a week the final vote on his confirmation to the Supreme Court and, in addition, raises the question of whether the results of the investigation could influence any Republican senator who decides to finally withdraw his support.
In an interview that will air Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Sen. John Kennedy and Sen. Lindsey Graham if the FBI could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
Of course, said Kennedy.
I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out and I asked him: 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, determined.
The vote of Graham, however, seems inamovible.
I've already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it tajantely”, said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
Not a single one of the people she names has been able to confirm it.
It has been 36 years.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it been able to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive lineup of stars in support of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will travel to Central Park to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be informed about the real objective of the event: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international awareness that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
If you would like to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), attendees at the concerts have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending emails to a global leader, making a phone call or any other thing that serves to raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in the last 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just another form of "clicktivism", which refers to the position we adopt when we think we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "actions" in favor of a large number of diverse objectives.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have achieved commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2,250 million people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which, at least 10 000 million $ have been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", an association of investors and implementers with its headquarters in the United Kingdom united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential". With this in mind, they have proposed to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens collaborators.
Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, the donors, the national governments and collaborators of Global Citizens like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition.
The group also affirmed that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition in the United Kingdom for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we think can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
a collaborator of Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard road and, in many cases, we will stumble and fall.
But, as they have already achieved previously the movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will achieve our objectives, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances that we will have in the New York event of this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade of Russian energy exports - Department of the Interior
In case necessary, Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the Interior Secretary of the United States, Ryan Zinke, according to what is published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that the alliance of Russia with Syria, in particular where it operates on behalf of the legitimate government, is no more than a pretext for the expansion in new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the main supplier of Europe.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to guarantee that the maritime routes remain open and, in the event, could even block them to guarantee that energy does not end up in the market.
Zinke spoke to the people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In him, compared the approaches that Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia consists, basically, in taking advantage of and replacing fuels.
These statements are made when the Trump administration has been trying to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to relieve the function of the sea from Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this purpose, the members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin defends that the fervent opposition of Washington to the project responds only to economic motives and is another example of unfair competition.
I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be converted into a tool of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," said the Russian Energy Minister, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the Secretary of Energy of the United States, in Moscow in September 2014.
The U.S. position has found itself, however, with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organization that leads the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the U.S. not to intervene in the energy policy of the EU nor in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a meeting that took place recently between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibility of running for president in 2020, says the Massachusetts senator
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she will study the possibility of joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a court appearance in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering this challenge.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and to finally have women among our leaders,” she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.
Warren gave her opinion on President Donald Trump during a speech at the City Hall and said that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction".
I really worry about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren spoke openly about Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from Friday, Warren asserted that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe that she should run for president in 2020.
A 58 % of the "possible" voters of Massachusetts affirmed that the senator should not run, according to the survey of the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
A 32% of the respondents supported, however, his candidacy.
In the survey, support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, increased to 38 % with a possible candidacy and 48 % against.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for 2020 of the former vice president Joe Biden and the senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
The situation that my son is going through, everything that has happened to him since he came back, they know very well the other families that suffer the effects of the TEPT and other wounds with which our soldiers return, "said to the public that gathered in a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that nobody wants to talk about, and commented on her son and other veterans of war that "they come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
The Monday was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of firearms under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge for a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker who is facing the current directive, according to NBC News.
No one has revealed the full name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" that was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, American Civil Liberties Union) in opposition to the federal government's policy.
He said that his companion "and his children, who are members of a violent gang", abused her, but the U.S. officials denied his request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers who represent these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum requests to the U.S., as countries that face generalized problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States revoked a decision of 2014 that took the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA, for its English acronym) by which undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made some statements on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal legislation, all asylum requests must be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the individual case and, in contrast, this exception infringes that principle.
In addition, the lawyers pointed out in the letter that the policy that denies entry to immigrants hurts the economy of the United States by asserting that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs with greater frequency and "represent a necessary workforce."
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to deny asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
People can apply for asylum if they leave their home countries because of persecution or fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion.
The asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate efforts of rescue in Palu while the number of dead increases in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
The situation is very tense", we were told by Risa Kusuma, a mother of 35 years of age, while trying to console her baby with fever in a center for evacuees in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And the clean water is scarce
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search through the few belongings that are left to them in an effort to recover what they can.
There are hundreds of injured people and the hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and a shoulder, rested in the outskirts of the Army Hospital in Palu, where the patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous aftershocks, also very strong.
I couldn't help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he lived through while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to get to safety.
I was trapped in the ruins of the collapsed wall, I think", Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife ask for help and then a terrible silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well.
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses China of doing "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
One week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper touting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump made reference to the supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections of November 6, something that China denies categorically.
The accusation that Trump launched against Beijing over its alleged attempt to influence the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase the tariff levels on imports from both sides.
The compensatory tariffs China applied at the beginning of the trade war were designed to fall on the exporters of states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and business people.
According to what Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is intensifying even more that pressure with advertisements in our free press".
In order to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the precious American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by attempting to publish an advertisement in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, in the newsstand on the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few voices that disagree and no reflection of the diverse opinions that people in China can have on the worrying trajectory that China's economy is taking, since the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Communist Party of China.
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
The analysts point out that the Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the mid-term elections with the debacle of Kavanaugh
There are many Republicans of renown who are closing ranks in favor of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various accusations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that it may produce a setback, especially among women, in the upcoming elections that are being held in the middle of the legislature.
The emotions that surround this fact have been very intense, and many Republicans have expressed that they want to continue with the vote.
“In this type of issues, it is not possible to go back”, said Grant Reeher, a professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm the disgruntled voters on this issue.
The women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators who gathered in front of the Senate were chanting "November is coming!" (November will come soon!) in the moment when the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
The enthusiasm and the motivation of the democrats go beyond all expectations", said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, at the site of news.
The people say that the repercussion is already very relevant and, in fact, that is so.
But it could be even greater, especially among the indecisive women of the outskirts and the younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who do not usually vote even though they do not like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony in which she recounted in detail her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts indicated that a backslide could occur if the Republicans pressed ahead with the confirmation.
This issue has turned into a big mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, as reported by NBC News.
It's not just a question of the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor even if they sit on the bench, Kavanaugh; it's also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helps in the election of Democrats).
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who are on Kavanaugh's side.
In a new YouGov poll, it is indicated that 41 % of the respondents believe definitively or probably the testimony of Ford, while 35 % believe definitively or probably the testimony of Kavanaugh.
In addition, the 38 % said that they thought that, with all probability or definitively, Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while the 30 % said the same of Ford.
After the push of Flake, the FBI is investigating this moment the declarations of Ford, as well as, at least, the ones of another denunciant, Deborah Ramirez, informed The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when she was 17 years old.
On his part, Ramirez alleged that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is putting together a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the technology legend. A company that is based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention that hides behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world".
He has to be now, he said about the startup.
It's a historical moment.
The application uses the technology of Solid to allow users to create their own "personal data storage online" or a POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a browser and at the same time.
Something that is exclusive to online personal data storage is that the user decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the general director of the company, John Bruce, is to incorporate resources, processes and the necessary skills so that Solid can reach everyone.
For the moment, the company is formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers included in the staff that were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools that are available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking with "Facebook and Google about whether they are going to introduce or not a radical change where all their business models are completely modified from one day to the other.
We are not going to ask for permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate about the neutrality of the Internet.
Even though Berners-Lee is launching Inrupt, he will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web, Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
The lieutenant colonel reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a French sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made it worthy of his grandfather's decoration.
According to the London Gazette, the 29th of September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage", he advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
The lieutenant colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions taken by his grandfather were "so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a wreath after the parade, which included the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the true value of a genuine hero becomes apparent when he is shown such support".
The MMA fans were awake all night for the Bellator 206, but they only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine that he stays up all night to see the whole Bellator 206 so that at the end they don't let him see the main event.
The San José cartel included 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live on Channel 5 at night.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when the program changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people weren't surprised after having to stay up late to watch the fight alone.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a heavy joke".
There is a government regulation that regulates the content that is broadcast from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming.
""Peppa the pig", yes".
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they will modify the program to include British viewers in the next editions.
When I think about the option of retransmission, I think it can work.
But it's at 6 in the morning on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when they changed the programming, they received a large number of messages and not all were friendly, in fact.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I promise that the next time it won't happen.
We'll reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally do. We tried to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we passed.
It's a very unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a champion.
At 24 years old, he told us that he didn't realize it until he got to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the first programme of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that her intention in talking about gay rights was to transmit "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to put less importance on winning in the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this mythical programme, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for some months due to illness.
In the first program of Laverne, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not accepted socially that you liked children and girls".
He said: "Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to show that he was "something", he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexual orientation.
The winner of two bronze medals in the Olympics has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games held in Australia this year to claim that more countries should decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to transmit that "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion boxer declared that for him too it was a surprise to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley got married last year to the winner of an Oscar, who is 20 years her senior, though she specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
When you live so much from such a young age (she was at her first Olympics at 14 years old and her father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows that you have.
The couple had a son in June whom they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "global perspective" had changed.
If they had asked me a year ago, all the answers would have revolved around 'I have to win a gold medal'
But you know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie".
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the first row.
I wasn't able to tell him that I couldn't be in the first row.
I had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he wasn't invincible.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
In that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: to compete in the pool in front of my family in the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This fact was also the one that inspired him to choose his first song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the phase of preparation for the Olympic Games. He still got goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in bad form, stayed on the bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will establish a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad milestone.
Phil Mickelson, who was playing in the event that takes place every two years to try to get a record for the 12th time, was beaten by the captain Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
In place of being in the center of the action, as so many times he has done for the United States, the five times champion of majors had to cheer on in some moments and, in others, try to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to rectify what ails him.
Never the most direct of the drivers, not even in the height of his career, the player of 48 years is not in his best shape for the field Le Golf National, where the long rough punishes continuously with errant shots.
Yes, if the field is not sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth game of Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games that they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, got off to an impressive start, Mickelson's match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, he could not say much more.
He understood perfectly the role he had today, he gave me a pat on the back and, wrapping his arm around me, said he'd be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest.
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a career of Ryder Cups that had never equaled in such a clear way the levels of his individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, although Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
It's fun, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to make fun of others; it's great to have him on the team.
I think that the younger players have enjoyed having him as support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings much more than just a game".
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, you can easily turn into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 Ryder Cup at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end only managed to finish with the other team on their heels by a minimum margin, winning 14½-13½.
“Don’t you ever forget that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did a great tournament in Brookline and we lost, we did a great tournament in Valderrama and we won, but by very little”, said Bjorn, pictured, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and leading it with a 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
The history will teach me and the whole world that that team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Come here and do what you have to do.
This doesn't end until the points are in the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, neither more nor less, that the best players in the world".
Proud of what his players have done on a very difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to get ahead of myself."
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual performances and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, you really put your golfing skills to the test.
That's the message we have to transmit to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it's time to leave your partner, go and get the best out of yourself.
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as a pair, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added four points.
The same Furyk has been on both ends in the last few days of those great tournaments and has been part of the team that won in Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he said when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players on the last day.
We have 12 superimportantes matches tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all advance in the same direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and got them out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow".
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole route.
The new German battleship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old frigates of the Cold War era, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to defective systems and the progressive increase in costs, according to local media.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that leads the new frigates of the class Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed now until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit some declarations of a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery delayed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-missiles, as well as some technologies of invisibility, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signals, very reduced.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuous delays have caused that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power in the oceans) will be already outdated when they start to serve, as Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate frigate F125 occupied the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially rejected putting the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It has been the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "critical software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if it was sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates will be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen: half the crew that had been on the old frigates of the class Bremen.
In addition, it was observed that the ship has an excessive weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tons is twice as heavy as other ships of the same class that the Germans used in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached the 3100 million € (3600 million $), instead of the initial 2200 million €.
The problems that are attributed to the new frigates are of special relevance to the light of recent warnings about the reduction of the naval power of Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German Bundestag, admitted that the German Navy is "losing ships capable of deploying".
The officer said that the problem has been getting worse with time, because the old ships were decommissioned, but they haven't been replaced with new ones.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in the Highlands of Scotland, aims to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is expected that everything that is discovered will throw more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide the next conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton's bats and brown long-eared bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to record the activities of the bats during the season.
The template and the volunteers of NHS will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
The experts will analyze the sounds recorded in the recordings to discover the frequency of the calls of the bats and what species make them.
Then a report and a map of the habitat will be produced to create a detailed image of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for nature for NTS, is hoping that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
With this information, it will be possible to determine the benefits of the management of the habitat, such as the creation of meadows and how to maintain the forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and in the United Kingdom have decreased considerably in the last century.
They are under threat due to the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
The wind turbines and the electrical cabling can also be a risk for them, as well as the insecticides and other chemical treatments of the construction materials or the attacks of the domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind,
sino that, due to its nocturnal hunting habits, its ears are more useful than its eyes in achieving its goal.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocation that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the whole country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the matter, who carry out regular surveys, inspections of nests and, in some cases, rescues.
The organization has inaugurated even the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in Scotland in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The director of the property, David Thompson, says that it is the ideal territory for them.
Here, in Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and the right habitat.
However, there are still many things unknown about bats, so the work that we do here and at other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop".
It is important to check if there are bats before carrying out maintenance work within the properties, as it is possible to destroy a bat colony unintentionally. This could result in the death of up to 400 female bats and their young, which would mean the extinction of an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and many other species about which we do not know how they evolve their populations".
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape at the same time that his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has cataloged the allegations of rape as "fake news", and says that people "want to be known" at his expense.
The lawyers have received instructions to file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping a woman from the United States, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of having paid 375 000 $ to hide the incident, according to Der Spiegel.
With a video of Instagram Live that has already accumulated 142 million followers hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, tarnished the report as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
What they have said today is false", says the five times winner of the Golden Ball looking at the camera.
They only want publicity at my expense.
It's the same story as always.
They want to make themselves famous just by mentioning me, but it's like that, I can't avoid it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", added the player, smiling.
The lawyers of Cristiano Ronaldo are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations that appear in what they have called "an inadmissible report on suspicions in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will try to obtain compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in the last years".
As it seems, the supposed incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After getting to know each other in a night club, supposedly, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the room of the player and there he, supposedly, raped her anally, according to the documents registered in the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga declared that Ronaldo knelt down after the supposed incident and told him that it was in a "99 percent" a "good boy" and that he had disappointed that "one percent" remaining.
In the documents it is declared that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also says that she went to the police and that they took pictures of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she had "fear of reprisals" and was worried about "being humiliated in public".
The woman, 34 years old, says she is trying to annul the agreement, since she is still traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has changed to Juventus, a great club of Italian football, for a contract of 100 million €.
Brexit: the United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret it for the rest of its life" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
We need an agreement, said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer affirmed that the repercussions that the delays in the customs in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cause the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Auris and Avensis models for Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My opinion is that, if Britain breaks away from the EU at the end of March, there will be problems with production in our factory.
Other car manufacturers from the United Kingdom have shown their fears in relation to the exit of the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers are related to the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on the "just-in-time" method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars by order.
If the 29th of March the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement, it could produce a disruption in the border that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and the shortage of parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than a day of inventory in its Derbyshire plant, said the company and, in such a case, production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Mr. May said that the Chequers plan of Theresa May, where the future relations with the EU are established, is "calibrated precisely to avoid those controls at the border".
We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that not only allows us to come out well from this moment but we have to take advantage of the opportunity.
“The evidence of Toyota, among others, is that we have to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a very successful supply chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say for how long it will stop production, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, in the end, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union representative at the plant, said his members are increasingly worried: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never come back".
A spokesman for the government said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan in which our future relations with the EU are defined."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be postponed another week, as the dispute over the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, connections between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation before Trump decides to fire the deputy attorney general or not and, in this way, compromise the independence of Mueller has fed the gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone that he himself carried to try to get rid of the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied that it was true.
However, last Monday was at the White House, between news where it is said that he was about to resign.
In his place, it was announced a meeting with Trump (who at that moment was in the United Nations in New York) for Thursday.
Trump said he "preferred not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the vote in the Senate.
The press secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "We haven't defined any date, it could be this week or it could be another, considering everything that's happening with the Supreme Court.
We'll decide as we go along and I'll be informing the press, as I usually do.
Some journalists would refute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what were the reasons.
Sanders said that the shortage of press credentials was not due to a dislike of grandiloquent TV reporters, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they fanfaronade."
Next, she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The president holds more sessions of questions and answers than any other president before him, said, at the same time, citing without proof: "We have compared those numbers."
The press briefings will continue, said Sanders, but "if the press has the option to ask directly to the president of the United States, I think it's much better than asking me.
We've tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
The press conferences with him alone occur very rarely.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why, where he made a casual and, at times, bizarre appearance in front of the assembled press corps.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to NHS staff in Scotland about their fears over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU team working in the HHS of Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and its desire to continue working with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens who work in public services that are not under the control of the central government.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit were expected to take place this autumn.
However, the government of the United Kingdom has also intensified its preparations in relation to a possible scenario in which there would be no agreement.
I know that all this must be very confusing for you.
Yes, that is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each and every one of the members of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue counting on you.
A Christian Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, player of the Tennessee State Tigers was surgically intervened after suffering a head injury the past Saturday, when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of The Tennessean.
The coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, informed the press that the injury occurred before the break.
Wine to the band and collapsed there
Both the coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A member of the Tennessee State team told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the transmission of land tax will be applied to those people who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year which will be used to help the homeless
The additional money that will be raised with the increase in the stamp duty for foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the homeless, announced Theresa May today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in the transmission tax will be levied on people and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivize the government's policy to combat begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transfer tax, also includes the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the "buy-to-let" system, which could reach up to 3 %.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of new-build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which is causing prices to rise and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get on the property ladder.
Many of the more affluent areas of the country (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend the majority of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of maintaining very high prices for properties by buying land without any intention of using it and urged the Sra. May to eliminate the fees that are applied to affordable homes to solve the "shameful problem of housing" in Great Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive reforms for housing, among which there are controls on rent and the end of evictions without cause.
He also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of the next generation."
And that implies solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Great Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes with greater ease than the British working class.
The dream of having a house has become too difficult to achieve for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real".
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland manager says his "primary objective" is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the club of the north-east, which at the moment occupies the third place in the League One (the third division of leagues in England), three points from the first.
Passed the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only managed to get a hat B", said Ross in Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child and it's something that has always made me want to go back.
That opportunity will only become reality, however, if I am able to lead a club to success.
Among the predecessors of Ross as the manager of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any fear when he turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
In this moment, the success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League,
because the structure and the installations of this club correspond, without a doubt, to the Premier League", he said.
It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I have achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it should be.
Ross is the only one who has three years of experience as a coach, after being an assistant in Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the technical body of the Hearts.
After that, he helped the Alloa to recover from the relegation to the third division and made the St. Mirren to win the championship in the following season.
In fact, Ross claims that he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a genuine crossroads,” he recalled in reference to when he took over at Alloa.
I always thought that direction was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It can sound weird, because it was good, I could make a living with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel well.
I have always wanted to train and now I have managed to do it, it is the time of my adult life in which I have felt better, without a doubt.

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday
The heatwave of the summer has pushed up the profits of British pubs that are struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on the restaurant chains.
The groups of pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7 % in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 %, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, from the consultancy firm CGA, who compiled the figures, commented: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have made that in July we keep the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased 2.8 % their profits, while restaurants have fallen even more.
The fall of 1.8 % in the commercial activity of restaurants in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly serve drinks had their best month, compared to the majority of restaurants, where they reduced their profits.
The pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered with the heat, although not to the same extent as restaurant operators.
It seems that people only want to go out to drink.
In bars and pubs managed, sales of drinks rose 6.6 % during the month, while sales of meals fell 3 %.
Paul Newman, the analyst of hospitality and leisure of RSM said: "These results follow the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The time and the repercussion of important social or sports events are still the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8 % drop in sales in comparison with last year is going to be especially painful in view of the continuing pressures on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the gastronomic operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures that we have had in August will provide the relief that they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new ones that have opened, was 2.7 % in July, which reflects the slow decline in the number of brand openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the restaurant, bar and pub sector in the UK, data is collected and analyzed for 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than £ 9,000 million and is the reference value of the market.
One out of every five children have secret accounts in social networks, away from their parents
One out of every five children (some even as young as 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that their parents and teachers don't know about, according to a survey
The survey, conducted on 20,000 high school students, revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages
The news have sharpened the fears that the content will be published
20% of the students said they have a "main" account that shows their parents
One out of every five children (some even as young as 11 years old) create secret accounts on social media that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake accounts on Instagram, a site for sharing photos.
The news have sharpened the fears that the content will be published.
20% of the students said that they had a "main" account that showed their parents, at the same time that they had other private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw how a teenager encouraged others to "violate" her.
The research, carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" in the board of directors of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to form part of the board of directors of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on track and field and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want to see sport benefit from her great international experience in the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the United Kingdom and around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from her involvement in the sport's governance.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help to develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters in the Olympic Games of 1996 in Atlanta between the four ors that he won and now is a regular expert in the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him without the ability to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I suffered a cerebrovascular accident."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell if I would recover or how much I would recover.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and now I'm doing agility exercises.
Thanks for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The ad for the breast pump where they compare mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A company of breast pumps has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares mothers who breastfeed with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the "world's first silent breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music where mothers talk about the freedom that the new breast pump gives them.
Four real women dance in a barn full of hay in the style of a dance floor, along with some cows, with letters like: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts".
The choir continues to say: "Feed them, feed them, I'm feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I'm feeding my women".
However, the announcement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has created a great controversy.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions of all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say that it puts the focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
A very unfortunate decision to put cows to announce this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to be able to produce milk, with the exception of the fact that they take their babies away from them days after giving birth.
El extractor de leche Elvie se adapta discretamente en un sujetador de lactancia (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce an extractor of milk for mothers who stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: “What a crazy ad”.
However, other people defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted that the song was “destructive”.
I think it’s a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'm sure I'd have one.
Using the pump, I felt like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I don't give it any more thought.
It’s a great product”, we were told by a woman.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad directed at mothers who use a breastpump (sometimes at work or in public restrooms), which makes them feel like cows.”
In the advertisement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who express their milk with a pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, it has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the nursing bra, which makes it possible for users to move, hold their babies and even go out with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, social and ECD of Mother, tells us: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative launch.
By showing the parallelism between expressive women and milking cows, we wanted to call attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, at the same time that we demonstrated in an entertaining and close way the incredible sensation of freedom that the new breast pump offers.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minors secretly sent to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied minors detained has experienced a considerable increase, despite the fact that the monthly inflow at the border has remained at the usual levels. In part, this is due to the harsh rhetoric and the policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take in a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal records.
“Around 80% of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.”
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people”, said Albence.
In his effort to process minors more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that will require that some of them must appear before the court within a maximum of one month from the arrest, instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to the workers of the reception centers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, instead of in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration-related matters.
Those who do not consider themselves eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to the workers of the reception centers and the reports of the system that have emerged in the last months, the longer they stay in custody, the greater the probability of suffering anxiety or depression, which could cause violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, the signs of distress in these children go unnoticed.
In addition, the transfer to the camp without having given them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could provoke them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria asks the “occupation forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the vice prime minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and that the issue “will be dealt with accordingly”.
“They must withdraw immediately and without conditions,” he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war against terrorism practically has ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “fighting in this sacred battle until we purify all the Syrian territories of terrorists and any foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advisory support to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this devastated country by war.
On the topic of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return, and blamed “some Western countries” for “seeding irrational fears” that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
“We have requested the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
The diplomats of the UN say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault on the Syrian forces and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had some “clear deadlines” and has expressed the hope that the military action will focus on the jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), which will be “eradicated”.
Staffan de Mistura, a special envoy of the United Nations, is waiting to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to draft a new constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguing that the work of the panel should be restricted “to review the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win reelection in 2020, unless, of course, as many liberal viewers surely expect, an impeachment or a scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This would be without a doubt “The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!”
At the moment there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the ratings for CNN and MSNBC have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million, respectively.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has exceeded the ratings of the cable news channels with 3.5 million viewers for the main news programs at night.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t understand”, Neal Baer, the executive producer of “Designated Survivor”, a dramatic series on the ABC about a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club”, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him that he would vote for Trump.
Why?
“Because it makes me laugh”, was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else we see on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the privileged can afford.
However, the information surpasses the limits when you take into account that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of “deep background” sources that used Bob Woodward to write his book “Fear”, the $15,000 ostrich leather jacket of Paul Manafort (“a prideful extravagance”, in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of the scabrous descriptions of Stormy Daniels of the anatomy of Trump.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s in part what makes everything seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of “Pawn Stars” and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when we talk about the rotating cast of Trump and his daily plot twists (whether it’s fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to get left behind.
When I went to talk this week with the Sr. Fleiss, it was a sunny day of 27 degrees in the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not detach himself from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when in those days we were doing all those crazy programs and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of western civilization”, Fleiss tells me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.”

The foreign money flows into the midterm elections of the most adjusted House of Representatives
It is not a surprise the influx of money that is coming to the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the reorganization of a district of the Congress with two candidates who seek re-election to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburg, whose structure was recently redesigned, has the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election in the spring.
Lamb faces off against another candidate for reelection, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps in large part with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a battle of financing for the campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
The name of Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, but later backed down
The diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with the President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June of 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Trump Organization evicted the administration of the Organization Trump.
U.S. State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, said Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
But only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received around $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, the development and economic support.
The sanctions proposed, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As the internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But at the end of September, high-ranking officials in the administration made it clear that their intention was that the conference go ahead, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a signal of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new threats or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of the special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice of Trump, of which there are already considerable proofs in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also investigating the possibility that the Trump campaign was working in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will have to answer to that chamber, just when he is preparing to run again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional sentences, and with this I do not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor the fall of his equivalent in Europe.
All of us will have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflexion, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several of these points of inflexion.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good position since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to do the job.
Rosenstein says that the explanation of The Times is not exact.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?”
In addition to all this, will we vote in midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these exams, we will find ourselves in a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we won't fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that had once occupied my ambassador's house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how could I not be an optimist about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic about the match against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against the Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against the Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
An injury to Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans prevented him from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We managed to get a good point, because Villarreal is a good team”, said the 31-year-old player.
“We started the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.”
Maybe we could have achieved the victory at the end, but, in general, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out all guns blazing and were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the previous game. But, with all the support from the fans, I'm sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now you can see a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying themselves a lot and we are having a good training.
I have the hope that we can move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success.
The fear of retirement savings is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that the participants of the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their family members.
Around half of the people who took part in Nationwide's study said they talked to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this.
“The people want me to be taken care of by a family member, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to talk about where and how to receive care, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Include in the conversion to your financial advisor, since it can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help you cover your expenses or to insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Take responsibility for obtaining a power of attorney for medical care to designate a person of your choice to supervise your medical care and to ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
He can also prepare a power of attorney for his finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake: who do you treat?” asks Martin.
“What medications are you taking?”
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned.
Several shots are fired at a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They shot a man several times with a rifle while he was walking home after leaving the house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was found in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (British time), as a “random act”.
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and the police have made an appeal to possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said. It is expected that the number of deaths will increase.
With the communications blocked, the officials of assistance have not been able to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, a northern area of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, which is a lower administrative region hierarchically inferior to the province, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but they are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west coast of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a zone of great seismic activity, and it often suffers earthquakes.
Following, we summarize some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of the last years:
2004: A great earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, in the north of Sumatra, caused the 26th of December a tsunami that affected 14 countries and took the life of 226.000 people in the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims took place in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
There were hundreds of dead victims on the island of Nias, facing the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed more than 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the mortal earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of earthquakes of great magnitude that caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29 years old and a citizen of Wasilla (Alaska), was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to said police report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held without bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared on Saturday before the court, where he declared “definitely innocent” when he was asked for his declaration, reported the channel.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a Class B misdemeanor, with a sentence of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
Sarah Palin's mother called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the court of veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the reporting of a domestic violence crime, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had said that she hit him in the face.
A number of veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking the violent behavior of her son to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead victims
At least 384 people died after a quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communication networks have fallen and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just to the side of the center of Sulawesi, which is located in the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that circulate on social networks and that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived at the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October 31st attack on a bike path in the West Side of Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists as he went.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed “intentionally” the eight victims and caused “intentionally” serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible penalty of death, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury presented Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder in aid of a criminal enterprise, which federal prosecutors typically use in these cases, and one count of destruction of a motor vehicle.
The attack required “extensive planning and premeditation”, according to the prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved”.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, says the warning.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death penalty was carried out in a New York case was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiring to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse during the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he said to the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov said to the authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the flag of ISIS be raised in his hospital room, said the police.
He has been declared not guilty of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are “obviously disappointed” with the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved.
The defense team for Saipov had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilise the people’s army” today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UKIP said that politicians had to “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have left the EU by now if Nigel Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing the Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more when a group of Tories in favour of remaining in the EU have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers plan on its feet in the face of attacks from Brexiteers, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted on continuing to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force the euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the chaos.
The MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers”.
In his declaration of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.”
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
He dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false”.
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she said to reporters: "Just one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people."
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular among our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.
In a message directed to May, he added: First ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Farage said to the concentrated that they would have to feel the heat if they were going to betray the decision taken in the referendum of 2016.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class”, he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit, feel the heat.”
“We will mobilise the people’s army of this country that gave us victory with the Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, the supporters of the permanence marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists were waving Tories Against Brexit placards after the launch of the group this weekend.
The laborist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with an application of the party during the inauguration of the conference.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the IT systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for the free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It’s a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit.
Warren considers all the possibilities of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider all the possibilities” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat of Massachusetts spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There has been a lot of speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The afternoon event on Saturday in Holyoke was his 30th meeting with the voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.
An arrested for the murder of the LSU player with a gun
The police of Baton Rouge (Louisiana) announced this Saturday that they have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, the basketball player of LSU, the past Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20 years of age, was shot to death near the campus of Southern University at first light on Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death”, said the police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted having been at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98m tall player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team handed him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a key role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton out of the race by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to enter the boxes and let Hamilton run in the back of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out of the pits a lap later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after an action with the wheels almost touching that made the Ferrari driver have to give up the inside line at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old that day, started from the last row of the grid and finished in the seventh place at the end of the first race.
After leading a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered the boxes in the 44th round, but he could not increase his rhythm in the eight remaining rounds after recovering Raikkonen the fourth position.
It has been a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple
That was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia Occidental, the president did not mention directly the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, repulsive and false”.
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these last few days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false.”
“When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say “But if I didn’t do it.”
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? - “Oh, oh, ¿qué?
Oh, no.
I didn't filter it.
Good, wait a minute.
Have we filtered...? No, we haven't filtered”, added while imitating the senator.
A Feinstein received the letter in which the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford were detailed in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not leak her story,” said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and, therefore, I did.”
But his refusal didn’t seem to sit well with the president, who during his Saturday night rally commented as follows: “I’m going to tell you something: that was a really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn't do it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing with his defense of the nominee to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get power and control”, said the president according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Belfast Giants 5-3 Dundee Stars
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against the Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match on Saturday by 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants took an early two-goal lead thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local tie before Dwyer restored the lead of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee United before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had just beaten Dundee by 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the three previous games.
The first goal of Dwyer came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered an initial very animated period, Sullivan returned to put the local team with the desire to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to equalize the game in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the second half and secured the victory with the fifth goal of his team as he approached the final whistle.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane after the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and there are many missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi, triggering a tsunami.
The strong aftershocks continue to batter the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21 years old, refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu. The tower was being affected by a strong tremor.
He stayed firm to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
After jumping from the traffic control tower, he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this”, added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there are still many bodies under the rubble and we have not been able to contact many people,”
Some waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
The aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute comes an ambulance with more bodies.”
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted in all places.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is trying to help as much as possible to the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the army of the country: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.”
Are you ready?
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in the first half of this year, which killed more than 550 people..
Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that a man has disappeared, after having said that the 47 passengers and the crew had evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening it could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had overshot the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane arrived very low.
“That’s something extremely good”, said Jaynes.
Jaynes commented that he and other travelers were able to advance through water that reached their waists to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said that the passengers on the plane panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who were working on repairs to a pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the aviation security network in Papua New Guinea indicate that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution finished presenting its arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the Department of Justice of the U.S. Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
Told the jury how he used cell phone records to tie the movements of Quinton Tellis, the accused in the death of 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, to the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received the location data of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford rose to the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying, because my truck was in Nashville”.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records indicated that they met only a week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the messages, calls and contact information of Chambers from his phone.
“He erased her from his life”, said Hale.
The defense has scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be decided by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: ¿Qué es el hip hop consciente?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that hip hop has moved away from its original political messages and is now dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Interpreters like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A nanny from New York sues a couple for firing her after a “racist” text
A nanny from New York is going to sue a couple for discrimination after receiving an incorrect text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person”.
The couple denies that it is racist and compares the demand with a case of “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her consternation at discovering that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO OTRA PERSONA NEGRA”, wrote the Sra. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, a “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead she was expecting a Filipino nanny, according to what is said in the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for a day's work and sent it home in Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for a compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving a compensation of 350 dollars a day for the position of six months of internal work for which he had been hired, although without a contract.
“I want to show them that things don’t happen like that”, he said to The Post on Friday and added that “I know this is a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racists by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, since they feared that they could not trust her after having offended her.
“My wife had sent her something that she didn’t want to say.”
She's not racist.
We are not racists”, said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was a mistake?”
To your newborn?
Come on!”
Comparing the demand as an “extortion”, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a baby two months ago and that she was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Are you going to go like that?”
That’s not a very decent thing”, added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public opinion court has been quick to denounce the couple in the social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and their logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who was reading the book for the first time before its publication.”
It is very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC chambermaid before inspiring him to write the book for children, trusted that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something “agridulce” after his father’s death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family”, she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a very quiet man and he didn’t like to boast”, he said.
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieved something important: you were proud of him, though it wasn’t really your achievement.”
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to his own Paddington”.
My daughter was dying and I had to leave by phone
When the plane landed, her daughter was rushed to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“She was calling regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that she didn’t expect to succeed”, said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“After I received the call from Nad to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.”
And so I did.
I told him: “Tashi, I love you very much, darling.”
I will be ready for you.
I will be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to maintain the pumping of his heart were running out slowly and were leaving his system.
She had died before her time and everything was dying.
Only I could sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not howl, nor scream, nor cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay firm.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was going through.
“Nobody knew”, he said.
“I bent my head and the tears were falling all the time.”
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
What I needed was all my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning put cards to avoid suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicides are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call if they need help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, had 13 years when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day”, he said.
Davis, 45 years old and who lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up any place.
However, he left his job before he died, because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after having taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I worry constantly that it could have repercussions.”
Davis created the cards “so that people know that there are people to whom you can turn and with whom you can talk, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk about it.
The Mrs. Humphreys, who is a friend of Davies from years ago, lost her partner Mark, who she had been with for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“He didn’t say that he was depressed or anything like that”, we are told.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.”
The day of Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn't even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to get over it: “He left a void in the whole family.
He has left us destroyed.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs by a thread as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited investigation, with a limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity,”
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican partisans not want the FBI investigation to take place?
His refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
There are only five weeks left until the mid-term elections, November 6. If, as is expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to elect the man they want for the highest court in the country will be gravely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear if Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of deserters from North Korea “fall” with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said that last year there were 1,127 deserters, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs charged by traffickers of people, have been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of deserters from the north are finally offered citizenship in the south.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers that the deserters are illegal immigrants instead of refugees and, often, they are repatriated.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved considerably in the last months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to have talks that focused on the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work for a peninsula of Korea free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the foreign minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the lack of progress on U.S. sanctions.
“Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “histrionic” and says he’s not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said that the nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was a “histrionic” and that he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin (Texas).
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she’s a hysteric,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny the accusations that he had sexually assaulted the doctor Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his initial declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also condemned explicitly the Democrats, calling their accusations against him “grotesque and clearly coordinated defamations” organized by some liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, the testimony of Kavanaugh proved that this one could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed his partiality against the Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualified himself with those statements and the way he’s pursued the Clintons and the Democrats,”
Pelosi objected when she was asked if she would impeach Kavanaugh if he were confirmed in the case and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say one thing: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he’s not fit to be on the court that he’s on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible sentences of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, which is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a histrionic and impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is all right,” said Pelosi.
And women have to hold it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's been months and years of fury overflowing, and she can't let it go without crying.
“We cry when we are angry”, the Sra. Steinem told me 45 years ago.
“I don’t think that’s so strange, do you?”
She continued talking: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in some company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she was angry and began to cry, she said to the person with whom she was talking: “Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.”
No, I’m not angry.
And then I continued with what I was doing.
I thought it was great.
The tears are allowed as a way out for the rage in part because basically they do not understand well.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once when I found myself crying with a rage I could not express. An older woman, a serious manager with whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
“Don’t let them ever see you cry”, he said.
“They don’t even know you’re angry.”
They think you are sad and they will be happy because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who then was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-considered decision”, he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.”
Someone referred to us as "Blancanieves y los siete enanitos".
As the campaign was already very advanced, he stayed behind in the fundraising, so he promised that he wouldn't run for president again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?”
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on capturing voters instead of delegates, and anger at the sexism), that she choked.
“The logical thing would have been to think that he had had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.”
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
“Did he cry?”
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still a long way to go for the battle to end, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by putting tariffs on the main Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant climb took place this week with new tariffs that affect 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds sterling) in products, which charges taxes on half of the products that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has taken retaliatory measures, applying tariffs of five to ten percent to U.S. products with a value of $60 billion.
China has promised to equal the attacks of the U.S., and it is unlikely that the second most powerful economy in the world is going to relax soon.
Getting Washington to retreat would mean ceding to its demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, the experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war between the United States and China could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could make the conditions for a sudden collapse of the economy in one of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than what the spectators have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, associate fellow at the Center for a New American Security.
Syria is ready to welcome back refugees, says the foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions of the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground is today more stable and safer thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism.”
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to try to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their means of subsistence.
The UN estimates that, since the beginning of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are still six million people who live in the country and who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem recognized that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help to rebuild the country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or the aid of the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup of 2018 by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup on European soil in 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team won 14.5 points to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his ball into the water on the 16th hole par 3, admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Francesco Molinari highlighted in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 against the player with the lowest classification of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most victories in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help it today.”
It's been a very hard year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have recovered the cup.
It is a success of the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help”, said an emotional García after the victory of the European team.
Now he passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in an individual match.
“I feel an incredible pride to have beaten Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching this man”, said the golfer of 23 years John Rahm.
Woods lost the four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his career of the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, leaving only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting."
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we ruined it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
It's a great captain.
His 12 players have made a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now it's our turn to bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.
