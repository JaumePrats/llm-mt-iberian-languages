Welsh Assembly Members (AMs) are concerned about appearing 'Muppets'
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Member of the Labour Party in the House of Assembly stated that his group was concerned that it would be "Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that his whole group was 'disappointed' and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the leap from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name change, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the title of Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed broad support for calling a Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission had preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the WMP option had won the most support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly were apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could cause the Assembly President, Elin Jones, to lose her head, and she would have to send the bill on the changes through in a few weeks.
Legislation on the reforms will include other changes related to the operation of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word in the question of how they should be called when legislation is debated.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote in a referendum on the country &apos; s name change
Voters will be asked on Sunday whether their country &apos; s name will change to &quot; North Macedonia &quot;.
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighbouring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, has stated that he will disregard the vote.
However, the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin &apos; s bells fall silent for the difficulties of Harlem churches
"Historically, the older people I have spoken to say that there was a pub and a church on every corner," comments Mr Adams.
There is no 'either/or' today.
He noted that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People now socialise in a different way,” he says.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighbourhoods, where people go regularly.
With regard to churches, he was concerned that the money raised from the sale of assets would not last as long as leaders hoped and that "they will come back to square one."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore they will accelerate the closing of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin &apos; s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation went in the 1930s of the 20th century.
A black congregation that was worshipping there bought the building.
A black congregation took over St Martin's, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building and, while the congregation of Father Johnson was planning for its reconstruction, they also ordered the bell.
Rev. David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called them "the poor man's campaigns."
In July, the bell-ringer called it &quot; a cultural treasure &quot; and &quot; an irreplaceable historical instrument &quot;.
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first bass drum ever used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who played the larger Riverside Church drum 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Maarten did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Maarten in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese was &quot; trying to pass the costs &quot; to the parish board, even though it had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old boy shot by shark while diving for lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the first day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, so he and a group of divers went to his rescue.
Hammel commented that he initially thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then realized that he was &quot; screaming that he had been bitten &quot;.
Hammel noted when he arrived at the boy &apos; s side.
Hammel added, "I shouted at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark."
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children &apos; s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescuers, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there were over 135 shark species in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury &apos; s plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff on the shop floor in their style and beauty departments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at £2.8 trillion and with growth outpacing the fall in sales of fashion and homewares, the largest beauty halls will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, rolled out to more stores next year.
Investment in beauty comes at the same time as this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use shelf space that was once devoted to televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other retailers, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be trialling concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second of which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift towards daily small-volume shopping in local stores force supermarkets to work harder to get people to visit them.
Sainsbury's executive director Mike Coupe has said that stores will increasingly resemble shopping centres as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount stores into hundreds of outlets and introduced a number of Habitat stores since its purchase of these chains two years ago. It is believed that this has boosted food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute over how to split the income from the pharmaceutical product sales in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of Sainsbury's 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the scheme, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, commented: 'We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specialist staff who will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offer is designed to suit all needs, while an attractive environment and a convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is 'furious' after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, was 'furious' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the fashion and accessory brand Truly.
This business had compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den, by leaving his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the TV gold-digger admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for her Truly fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the head office of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's fortune, which was worth around £11 million.
While Willoughby, aged 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: &quot; Truly, Holly &apos; s top priority.
It was to be their long-term future, which would keep them going for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved completely stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters, ready to go on sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions of pounds due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly delay its launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples went on holiday together and Jones has a 40 % share in the television production company of Baldwin.
Willoughby is to become the face of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that "no business was discussed" last night.
A difficult conversation - &quot; and then we fell in love &quot;
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider &quot; unpresidential &quot; and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump commented in his mock-newsman voice.
"I have not given up anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting with him again after Trump praised the first meeting in June in Singapore as a great step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's chief diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an "appropriate response" from the US to North Korea's first steps towards disarmament.
On the contrary, he said, the United States was continuing to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump &apos; s speech was much more optimistic in the speech he gave at his rally.
He said, "We get along great with North Korea."
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, assistance in freeing hostages and bringing the remains of American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to the Kim relationship.
It is very easy to be presidential, but then, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we would have about 200 people right here, he commented, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs had been told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, a national emergency had not been declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a little,” explains Mrs Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations would be allowed to provide assistance.
Given that the ground is constantly shifting in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly ill-prepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even with prior warning, may have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travelling from one island to another in Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the new disaster enclave.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia &apos; s dilapidated infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has allocated quite a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who is facing re-election next year.
It must also cope with the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, scores against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea's goal, when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot and kicked it off with his left foot.
The action was directed over the area and towards the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
“I was trying to get into that position to get on the ball and the players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I gave him a little tap. I didn &apos; t think about it too much, I just let fly.
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues &apos; top scorer Eden Hazard made a step-over pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning and dribbling into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle.
He then made a nice run into the area, which led to Hazard &apos; s goal.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished by kicking the ball into the net from the second post with a left-footed shot that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
On Wednesday, 15:00, Liverpool plays against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Meanwhile, Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Indonesian emergency agency early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday, unleashing waves as high as six metres, according to the spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380 000, was covered in debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a suspect in a murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, leading to the arrest of a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, Birkenhead, and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
In addition, I would recommend that anyone who may have seen anything on dashcam contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some people who claim to know the woman came to the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim &apos; s family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that nobody can enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to discover what had happened.
Residents are now being told that they will be allowed back in a few hours.
Someone heard an officer telling a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He keeps repeating "it is terrible."
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several officers remained on duty inside the cordon, controlling the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Merseyside Police on DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, incident number 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell statue in Parliament becomes the latest'rewriting of history' memorial
Its banning would be a poetic act of justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England by its puritanical fanatical followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestions as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, commented: 'In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell from Westminster Hall would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Cromwell the wronged may be sacrificed on the altar of his ancestor Thomas's actions in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft Cromwell is a testament to the opinion of the nineteenth century and to part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: 'Many people consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than now, a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
If it is a completely accurate description, then it is a matter for the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
Chinese pig farmer attacked by killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a livestock farmer at a market in south-west China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his family name "Yuan," was found dead with an artery severed and covered in blood near a pigsty at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pigsty in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The following morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that there was a big pig with blood on its mouth in the pigsty.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig weighing almost 250 kg had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin &apos; s legs were bloody and broken,” the cousin, who is known by his family name Wu, told the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan &apos; s family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, this is not the first time that a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilos had cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it off.
After pigs ate a rancher in Oregon in 2012, a rancher in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a 'trigger'.
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to do harm.
What is needed is the appropriate respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the south-west of the United States.
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters off the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rain to northern Mexico and the south-west of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa produced winds of more than 136 km/h, a hurricane of category 1, since Sunday 5 a.m. (Eastern time) and was located about 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressure is beginning to develop in the Pacific, moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the heavy tropical rains northward, towards the south-west United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical rain meets the approaching low-pressure system, widespread heavy rain will occur in the south-west over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible desert slides.
Intense tropical rainfall will cause precipitation rates of 5 to 8 centimetres per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 10 cm is expected in parts of the south-west, especially in most of Arizona.
Because of the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall, flash floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions may occur.
Because of the threat of tropical downpours, it is not recommended to go on foot into the desert.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms will cause localized winds and dust clouds.
The approaching low pressure systems will bring strong rains to specific parts of the southern California coast.
Heavy rainfall may result in up to 2 centimetres of rain, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
These would be the first heavy rains of the wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before becoming widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will continue through Wednesday.
Intense temperature changes in the United States can be observed in October due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes this means drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the whole of the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the long-lasting heat of summer will try to recover and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to see a warm start to October, with widespread temperatures in the mid-20s from the Southern Plains to parts of the north-east.
On Tuesday, New York could see temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probabilities of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing
More than 20 million people watched the tearful testimonies of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the policy remained stalled and the media interrupted their regular programming to report the latest developments from Friday: an agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while she was drunk and that he tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely certain that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, saw it on Friday.
The company accounted for the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other channels that carried the speech, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has some problems in calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a hearing akin to a football playoff game or an Oscar award ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led the pack, with an average of 5.69 million viewers for an all-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 billion, NBC had $2.94 billion, MSNBC had $2.89 billion and CNN had $2.52 billion, Nielsen commented.
After the hearing, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the cameras of CNN and CBS caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday morning.
As he was being scolded, live on CNN, he looked crestfallen.
One woman said, "Looking me in the face."
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?"
She continued: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at his appearance before the Committee.
Cable and broadcast television carried it live hours later, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to nominate Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision was critical, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan for Britain to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, is due to address the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his, Boris Johnson, his former Foreign Secretary, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "completely absurd."
Wayde murder: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player &apos; s death
A suspect has been arrested by the police in the death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder by the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police state that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The glasses were recovered by the police at the crime scene and reportedly contained Simpson &apos; s DNA, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say that he admitted shooting Wayde.
A bail of USD 350,000 has been set, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner &apos; s Office released a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
The department acknowledges the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the criminalistics laboratory of the State Police, the Southern University police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "diligence and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who is over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
It had scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one game of the last season.
On Friday morning, Will Wade, the men &apos; s basketball coach at LSU, said his team was &quot; devastated &quot; and &quot; in shock &quot; over the death of Wayde.
These are the things that people always worry about, he commented.
Volcanic ash falls on Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached neighbourhoods south of Mexico City.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre was shaken and rocked by several tremors.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of vehicles in neighbourhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as &quot; Don Goyo &quot;, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence demonstrators clashed with riot police as thousands of people took part in counter-demonstrations on the first anniversary of the polarized Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been blocked by the riot police hurled eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Fights also broke out later and the police used batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups, with slogans such as "no forgiveness, no forgetting," clashed with unionist demonstrators, shouting "Viva España."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the 1 October vote, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrated.
The voters had chosen independence by an overwhelming majority, although turnout had been low, as those who were against secession had boycotted the referendum to a large extent.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent voting at polling stations throughout the region, where violent clashes took place.
The independence groups camped out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he commented.
Despite a narrow but vital victory in the December regional elections, pro-Catalan parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, await trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
“It is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be standing in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for driving a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly driving a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that the entrances and the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, the car may have been shot at with a crossbow.
Menga strike gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga &apos; s first goal for Livingston secured the victory
A Livingston-promoted Rangers impressed the Rangers by securing Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference, Gary Holt's goal taking the score to 2-1, with Hibs in second place.
This season, Gerrard has yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face leaders Hearts, eight points ahead.
Before that, Rapid Vienna will be playing against Rangers on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their winning run in the division to six games, while manager Holt, who has not tasted defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month, is still waiting for his first loss.
Livingston misses chances against a resolute visitor
The Holt team should have gone a step further much earlier than they did, causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence but shot wide from close range, and Alan Lithgow had a shot deflected in after a cross from Craig Halkett had been headed on by Scott Robinson.
The home team &apos; s team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the visitors with their long-ball tactics.
That was how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston looked for an opening, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that point Rangers were in the ascendancy but failing to break down the home defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was fairly untroubled.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Moreno forced a save from Kelly.
Rangers &apos; keeper Allan McGregor parried a Scott Pittman shot with his foot and Lithgow was well wide with a Livingston effort.
There were long-range shots in the Livingston area, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one after Halkett &apos; s run-in on substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a hand.
Livingston &apos; s &quot; Phenomenal &quot; (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous view is that they played a great game and continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His style of play and his squad have hardly changed since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain of the team, was immense and led a superbly organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some very good moments with Gerrard, they were short of goals.
They failed to make the most of their chances, managing to get into the opposition half only once, which is a warning to Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters turned up in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also spoke out against both his policies and the German government &apos; s decision to welcome him to the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, who is received as a hero by some German Turks and as an autocrat by others.
Road traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at about 10.15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended to by paramedics, but he died on the spot.
The accident occurred after another cyclist was killed after being hit by a car that fled the scene on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the site of Saturday &apos; s accident.
The Metropolitan Police stated that officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been blocked and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured during disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in a brawl in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison directorate.
The disturbances started at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 9.30 on Sunday and are still continuing.
A team of elite specialists (known as &quot; Tornado &quot;) are in charge of controlling the disturbances, which involve eight inmates and are taking place in one of the wings.
The officers received minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman commented: 'Specialist prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have received medical assistance for injuries.
Violence is not tolerated in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may serve more time in prison."
Long Lartin prison holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical care after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which prison staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the south-west of the desert, with the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern Nevada and eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make a direct hit on Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain beginning late Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix commented in a tweet that only "10 hurricanes have maintained their tropical storm or depression status within 321 miles of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of rainfall, with isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona receiving up to 15 inches.
Rainfall is likely to be 2 to 5 cm, with the potential for 10 cm in isolated areas, in other parts of the SW Desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In areas not at risk of flash floods, Rosa rains are a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial because of the current drought conditions in the south-west.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have hurricane-force winds with maximum sustained winds of 136 kilometres per hour, is located 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving northward at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is running into cooler waters in the Pacific, and is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm over Mexico during the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rainfall, with the potential for flash flooding, is forecast for parts of Mexico, where there is a significant risk of flooding.
“Heavy rains of 7 to 15 centimetres are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimetres, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward as a tropical storm, approaching the border of Arizona by early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then move across Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
The main danger of Rosa or its remains is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, north-west Sonora and south-west of the US desert, according to the National Hurricane Centre.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, at about 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital, where he is &quot; stable &quot;.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Somerset, according to the Avon and Somerset Constabulary.
The officers have appealed to anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh &quot; suffered the meanness and anger &quot; of the Democratic Party
Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democrat &apos; s ruthless and disgusting tactics, said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford &apos; s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, "Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our day, a jurist with an admirable record of public service,” he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh &apos; s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not running, but I am in the race,
That is why I go from one place to another fighting for great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
A senior Republican Party official told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the toll is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that have been ravaging the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six metres came ashore in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When yesterday &apos; s tsunami warning was issued, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, logs, houses, everything on the land, said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 kilometres per hour before hitting the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Repeated shelling continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT, in Indonesian) reported in a statement that the energy released by the great earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
He added that the geography of the city, which is built on the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, and 540 persons were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications &quot; were completely paralysed and there was no information &quot; from Donggala, commented Nugroho.
The Red Cross said that more than 300 000 people were living there, and that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
That was a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse, he said.
On Saturday, the agency came under fire for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the agency &apos; s officials say that the waves had already reached the coast by the time the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard warning people in the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in the surrounding areas of Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities say, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city &apos; s airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to the evacuation centres in Paul on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
That is very bad.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala had arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees were sheltering under tarpaulins set up in the garden of their offices, they had seen a devastating scene on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
He said he had been told that many houses had been destroyed.
That is very bad.
Even as the aid machinery was being put in place, some people were complaining that experienced aid workers were not being allowed to go to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can be used only if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
That has not yet happened.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” commented Aulia Arriani, the Indonesian Red Cross spokesperson.
"As soon as the Government says that it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international aid, but it has not happened yet."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and family of those still missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolate stories that natural disasters write.
A small child was pulled from a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother &apos; s body.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other students of his, including Mr Mandagi, were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel.
"For me, as a paraglider, I carry my own emotional baggage," he commented.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a grey verification mark, not two blue ones.
He said that he believed that meant that the messages had not been delivered.
Thieves steal $26,750 during an ATM cash-in at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a Brink employee was robbed of $26,750 while refilling an ATM machine at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM machine at the leisure centre and was preparing to top up the machine with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money intended for recharging.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will start to be called Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
It has been a while since West, aged 41, was dubbed Ye, the name he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album, Yandhi.
She replaced Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously stated that the word had religious significance for him.
“I think it &apos; s the most used word in the Bible, where it means &apos; you &apos;, &apos; she commented earlier this year while talking about the album &apos; s title with radio host Big Boy.
"I am you, we are you, means we.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only one', to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the elected President of Mexico, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were gaining ground throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly stipends to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in AI, the US should double its investment in AI research, argues Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow announcements by various parts of the US administration that the US has an I.A. policy, even though the US in general does not have an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in A I by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging far behind the US. We are looking to the next step in the I.A. field," comments Lee.
Double the funding means double the chances of the next great achievement in I. A. being achieved in the US, as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Read, whose book 'AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order' was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player of Othello, and later worked as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google China.
He acknowledged the previous technological competitions of the United States Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often had to work hard to obtain government grants, commented Lee.
“It is not China that is taking the academic leaders; it is the corporations,” Lee noted.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent academics to work in I.A.
He commented that changes in migration policy could also help the United States to intensify its efforts in I.A.
"I think that doctors in I.A. should automatically be given permanent residence cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals from academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, commented Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Research Centre, which is intended to attract partners from industry and academia, while the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research into AI.
Meanwhile, the United States legislation to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has been dormant for months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change their country's name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name will change to “Republic of Northern Macedonia,” a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two Governments had reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claimed that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether participation will reach the minimum required 50% to make the referendum valid.
The question on the ballot paper was: 'Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said Olivera Georgijevska, aged 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, quite a number of Members have said that they will respect the result of the vote for it to be decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, said: 'I have come to vote for my children, we belong in Europe'.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on the name change of Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018, which would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents set up by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door, said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
I believe that the great majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Mr Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be a "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Policy Research Institute put the turnout at between 30% and 43%, which is lower than the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, in Macedonia, revealed that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50 % plus one.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, evades the whole Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling scored as Manchester City beat Brighton 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian centre-half received a yellow card at the start of the match.
It ran between three Brighton defences before entering open ground.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded one defender before outpacing several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who struck it with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan with a shot that hit the right post.
City manager Pep Guardiola commented: 'Agüero has a few problems with his foot.'
We said it would take 55 to 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave City the early lead in the Premier League title race.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In this play, Agüero received the ball very close to the Brighton goal.
He played a nice ball to the left wing for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave the aircraft a few touches before directing Sterling to the second mast.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net just before he went off the field.
The City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies &apos; party
With Nationals out of the contest by the play-offs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still chasing their first division title.
“Even though we are not playing for anything, at least we can kick the ball with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be up and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I have faced this year.
Why would you not want to participate?”
The Nationals are still looking for an opener for Sunday, but it looks like they are leaning towards starting Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who would be making his opening statement at the 34th meeting, held a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The record of the Washington pitcher is 18 wins and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 appearances.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation, his nomination to the Supreme Court, when speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is one of the most important. I am not running, but I am campaigning, and I am going from place to place to get great candidates, so I am not running.
He continued: 'We have this terrible radical group of democrats, they are passing now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, and we see the meanness, the evil.
They do not care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control, and we are not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, were embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
"We have seen it over the last four days," he said, saying that the Democrats were "angry, bad, horrible and fake."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I am waiting for an answer. Your body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen."
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, it hardly surprised me.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour Members of Parliament to be told that we are not welcome, just for saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way, being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of no confidence criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, for Europe. It is ironic that it was on issues where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders that he was most in agreement.
As stated in the notice for the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years that I have been a Member of the local Labour Party Parliament, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a'more compassionate and kinder' policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever was implemented at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every view is judged on whether or not party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I had previously thought shared a similar political vision started expecting me to change my mind radically and take positions with which I would never have agreed, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, there is a barrage of abuse on social media calling for my resignation, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one to have experienced this.
I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is the normalisation of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that broad range of views and, with every 'no-confidence' motion or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to keep my head down and not make too much noise and that would be fine.
But I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a schoolboy, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my comprehensive school's classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, as a councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and I did not do so in the last election either.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions and areas where I disagreed with the current leadership.
I would just say to those who promoted the motion on Friday that I do not understand this desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters, whether they are Labour voters or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal and no political opportunism will stop me from acting in what I believe to be best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an unbeaten Ayr tops the table
Two late tries may have decided the final outcome, but Ayr certainly deserved the victory in this long-drawn-out game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the 10 participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make the most of opportunities, that gave the local team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We have been tested in all parties and we are still standing, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, commented: 'Ayr deserves the recognition, they took the opportunities better than us'.
Grant Anderson's penalty at 14 minutes, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, on loan from the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opposition and Jason Baggot scored a penalty that was not converted.
Ayr extended their lead with a penalty, just before half-time, and then scored and converted a penalty to take the score to 17-5 in their favour at the interval.
However, Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson &apos; s try, converted by Baggot, reduced this lead to five points.
There was a long delay after Ruaridh Knott was carried off on a stretcher with a serious injury, and when the game restarted Ayr took the lead with a Stafford McDowall penalty converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, skipper of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having an extra man in a non-converting Bruce Colvine trial at the end of a period of great pressure.
However, the premises were recovered and when yellow carded for playing to the whistle without the ball, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul, which was moving forward.
The wind blew it in, as it had been doing almost since the game restarted, after Kyle Rowe had received the ball from David Armstrong on a kick and sent Gregor Henry flying into the goalmouth to win the fifth penalty for the home side.
Still Game star wants to steer his career towards the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be determined to move into the catering industry after it was revealed that he had been appointed manager of a restaurant chain.
The actor is Jack Jarvis, aged 56, who is famous for his role in the BBC's famous programme, which he writes and co-produces with his comedy partner of many years, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the ninth series will be the last, and Kiernan seems to be making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source in the Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming restaurant trade" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: a landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors are on duty at a naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases bear the motto: &quot; The sea is ours by right,
It is a duty to recover it."
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, the lost coast to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the nineteenth century is still vividly remembered, as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and calm, and is, of course, waiting for the outcome with a positive vision, commented Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia &apos; s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is engaged in a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution adopted on Monday.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia &apos; s favour and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based United Nations agency had no power to award Chilean territory and had stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of any possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling came only six months after the final pleadings indicated that the case &quot; was not complicated &quot;, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from advancing the cause of Bolivia, the past four years may have hampered it.
The problem of access to the sea had been seized upon by the current Bolivian administration, he said.
He also suggested that the bellicose rhetoric of Morales had undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will talk again at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court &apos; s decision-making was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia would be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
He also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind."
North Korea says that there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never be the first to give up nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
It urged the United States to honour the pledges made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
Your comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues that have been stalled for more than three months since this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
He said that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War and subjecting the North to the South was a "pipe dream."
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without some meaningful disarmament movement by Pyongyang.
Kim and the US President, Donald Trump, both want another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang &apos; s willingness to give up an arsenal that the country probably regards as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of enormous hats about to land in a street of shops near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a set of eccentric large-size hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was a beige hat with a wide brim decorated with feathers that enveloped the heads of the models.
Other large-scale supplements included a watermelon with jewels, a witch's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-up lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a full diving team, complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like large-size fashion, you are in luck.
The haters predict that the huge hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
Big hats are in, thanks to "La Bomba", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimetres being worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand of worship behind this impractical hat that flooded social media presented another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini that carried it.
The raffia-woven orange bag, decorated with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As fashion designer Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories."
John Edward: linguistic skills are vital for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in examinations, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community projects.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they will occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, modern languages are still popular and in demand in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said: 'If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his head.
If you talk to them in their language, you reach their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we look at the results of the recent examinations this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables, with the pass rates highest in independent schools.
Overall, 68 per cent of pupils studying foreign languages achieved an A grade, the highest grade.
Data from the 74 centres in the SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A in Chinese, 72 per cent in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental skill that will certainly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Currently, languages are considered to be on the same level as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and everywhere else.
A survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that, of the reasons given by employers for difficulties in filling jobs, 17% were attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential for language skills in the workplace is increasing, making these skills essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future, thanks to this skill, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will enable that person to automatically get ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
That is why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, they will be better equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, different languages will be taught in different schools.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child &apos; s interests, independent schools always offer a choice of languages taught by specialist staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered "competences for international communication."
The independent sector will continue to offer these choices, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Well, we must do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans waiting to see LeBron James make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the season &apos; s opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is still not clear how many minutes he will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton commented on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers &apos; six-game pre-season schedule.
At this stage of my career I do not need pre-season parties to prepare myself, he said.
Time of Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled by Trump for next week, including stops at partisan rallies in Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy on hold, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are counted in November.
What time is Trump &apos; s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be viewed online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. this evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
It can be viewed online through a live YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to comment on this week &apos; s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hearings, which were overshadowed by allegations of sexual misconduct and have left a Senate confirmation vote on the horizon for at most a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main aim of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans facing the November elections to get a boost.
Thus, the President &apos; s campaign noted that the five rallies next week are intended to &quot; rally volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives &quot;, according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign,” said a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling is scheduled to draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage from Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is trailing in the polls.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and push him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the US team shows that it is daring to fight to keep the hope alive for the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing of momentum is a completely made-up concept, but the players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
So where do you say the impetus is now?
“They had six shots on us and now they have four, so I guess that &apos; s a little momentum, &apos; said Jordan Spieth after the round.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, the Americans feel they have a bit of wind behind them and plenty of reasons to be cheerful, not least the partnership of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and managed three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and preaches by example.
The guttural roars of celebration grew louder as the round progressed, introducing a vital putt for a half when he and Thomas were two down after two holes.
The putt that they got on the 15 was greeted with a similar cry, one that said, 'I think the Americans are still in it.'
What is needed is redoubled efforts and concentration on the party, he commented.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable couple of Europe are four from four and nothing can go wrong.
Moliwood was the only pair to score a bogey-free round on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That run and the way he is playing with the crowd in full voice makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a potential European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Nevertheless, it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning, after partnering Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede and they never got out.
But there will be no help to get out of the holes on Sunday.
Four-ball and foursomes are fascinating to watch up close because you see the interplay between the couples, the advice that is given and not given, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team is not afraid to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after the fourballs and foursomes were won 10-6 against the United States.
The two-man team of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods, who fell four places in the Le Golf National rankings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a United States team that made many errors in the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs to pick up eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball, their magnificent partnership saw them defeat a dejected Woods and the American rookie Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who had not really shone in the two matches on Saturday, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome matches, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning four-ball, was back with Henrik Stenson in the afternoon four-ball, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world Nos. 1 and 3 respectively, 2 and 1.
Although the day was pleasant and calm in the south-west of Paris, Europe was not entirely on its side.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas served as a blueprint for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They won a thrilling 2 and 1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish player Jon Rahm in the four-ball and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has come back from a four-point deficit in the singles only twice, but Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they were the second best for two days, it seems that mounting a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that there is &quot; no possibility &quot; of unilateral disarmament if there is no trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his country &apos; s distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country &apos; s unilateral abandonment of nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the international agency that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States, he noted.
"If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances there is no possibility of our unilateral disarmament."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea &apos; s well-known complaints about Washington &apos; s resistance to a &quot; phased &quot; denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an American president in office and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim committed to working towards &quot; denuclearization of the Korean peninsula &quot; and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the formal end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States has insisted on denuclearization first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose by force, even objecting to a declaration of the end of the war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of the sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced in blaring headlines by the US leader at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding, "If South Korea had been the party concerned in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri &apos; s tone was radically different from last year &apos; s speech to the UN General Assembly, when he said that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be directed towards US soil after &quot; malignant president &quot; Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim &quot; rocket man &quot;.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to &quot; totally destroy &quot; North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said that much more needed to be done and that sanctions must continue to be applied until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: 'We can take two years, three years, five months, it doesn't matter.'
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the UN Security Council on Thursday: 'The Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the full and verified denuclearization'.
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but, a few hours later, North Korea denounced its "demands as those of a gangster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantling a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States implemented “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to sleep enough
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students are sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of all-night studying fuelled by caffeine.
A professor discovered that students at the world &apos; s number one university often had no idea about basic self-care.
The course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States, was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was only hearing about this now, in her final year.
He said that no one had ever spoken to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me.
The course, which was introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos; s health services, noted that the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were hardly sleeping during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section features a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are informed that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, an icon of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students overnight.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He stated that the culture of &quot; all-nighters &quot; still exists and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and good quality sleep should be the'secret weapon' of students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain generate a feeling of hunger, hence the constant desire to eat.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler &apos; s recommendation is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of &quot; blue light &quot; emitted by screens of electrical appliances and LED, which can alter circadian rhythms, and so end up having problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga goal sends Gerrard's men packing
Rangers suffered another away-day depression when the Dolly Menga onslaught saw the disjointed Steven Gerrard team go down 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to record their first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, the runaway leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
The Menga attack came just minutes before half-time and the Rangers &apos; lacklustre performance was never in the game.
Now the Rangers drop to sixth, Livingston rise to third, behind Hibs by goal difference.
The Rangers may have more problems, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was allegedly thrown from the visiting supporters &apos; section.
Gerrard changed eight of the winning team from the Ayr game, and they went on to the semi-final of the Scottish League Cup.
For their part, Livingston, who took a point off Hearts last week, would have been delighted with the way their organised team stifled the opposition throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made the ball count when they had it.
They should have been at two minutes, when Menga made a pass into space for Scott Pittman, who got through the defence, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the central midfielder cleared it.
Keaghan Jacobs was penalised for a high tackle on captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defence, Alan Lithgow, could only kick it out on the full.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction in their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the game when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson ignored his Colombian appeals.
Rangers had two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly barely had a save to make as Lassana Coulibaly &apos; s header and Ovie Ejaria &apos; s long-range effort were both comfortably held.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute was against the odds, nobody can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with a deep ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to score.
At half-time, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact as the ball was played to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block it.
Still, Livingston kept the visitors exactly where he wanted them, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing the way with long passes.
Holt &apos; s could have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow scored a header that went over the bar.
The Rangers substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty in the dying minutes after a clash with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and counting... the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, was also a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film 'The Bells of Coronado' with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the earphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals. &quot;
Evans: 'It's like a radio!'
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to reach the age of 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine may teach immune system to'see' cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a common protein in many cancers and re-direct it.
A trial of the vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can &quot; see &quot; a common protein called HER2 that is found in many cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: 'Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.'
HER2 “promotes growth of different types of cancer,” such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancerous cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West went on a pro-Trump tirade with a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It did not work out.
Kanye West was booed off the Saturday Night Live studio after a chaotic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the slogan Make America Great Again, he began to rail against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Mr. Trump.
I talk to white people all the time and they ask me how I can like Trump when he is racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago, &quot; he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon making fun of Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording was not aired, comedian Chris Rock posted the audio of West &apos; s tantrum on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the audience that he had had a hard time backstage because of the hat.
They were rude to me.
I was told not to go out with my hat on.
They were at me!
And then they tell me I am sleeping, &quot; he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: 'Do you want to see me sleep?' and added that he was 'going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The studio went completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confounded many when he came on stage to sing I Love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: thank you for resisting the crowd."
Karen Hunter, a talk show host, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful."
But I decide to say NO to someone (by buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) whom I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We also, he added.
Before the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now 'the person formerly known as Kanye West'.
It is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Your colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been known as Snoop Lion, and the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, aged 31, attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such screen roles often conveyed to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that &quot; something went wrong &quot; and questioned how to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he thinks it "quite important" to address this issue.
"Personally, I think it is quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?"
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking of the problems they are now facing?"
Kit believes that television can have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: 'What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and in the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
In November, Kit will star in True West, the Sam Shepard play about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, she gave me my future family and my life from now on, he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, Kit Harington &apos; s love interest in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm belonging to Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820 000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40 000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were infected through sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
HIV traditionally spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way has been reduced to a very small extent, Chinese health authorities stated at a congress in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but the LGBT community suffers from much discrimination.
Because of the country &apos; s conservative values, studies have calculated that between 70 and 90 per cent of men who have sex with men will end up marrying women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to the lack of proper protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked information about Republican senators and claims that it is 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
Representative Maxine Waters criticized the allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators on Saturday.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that those allegations were being pushed by "right-wing" commentators and websites.
Waters commented in a tweet, &quot; Lies, damn lies and more lies &quot;.
The information published allegedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person in the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with Waters &apos; office and released the data of a Waters staffer, according to the Capitol.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a complete lie, continued Waters.
The staff member, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and a complete lie. &quot;
Waters &apos; statement was immediately criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote, "This information is denied in anger."
This suggests a lack of the necessary temperance to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
It must not rebel.
It should not question the motives of the accuser.
It must remain calm and serene.
It seems Fleischer wanted to compare Waters &apos; reaction to the Democrats &apos; criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom detractors accused of seeming too angry during his Thursday testimony.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If true, that was very serious, he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had alerted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations."
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally accountable for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all my staff members.
Johnny English: Reborn. Rowan Atkinson's spoof spy is a bit of a let-down
It has now become a tradition to look for Brexit guff in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what to do with this new Johnny English franchise of action and comedy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-deprecation about how clearly ridiculous we are be the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his licence to cock things up for the second time. His name alone gives clues that this is a comic creation aimed at non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to be a spendthrift, has a little bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a dash of that sort of thing who touched a single note on the subject of Cars 2 which was touched on at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Furthermore, it was originally based on the mysterious international man of mystery, represented years ago by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in his wake.
There are one or two good moments in the last delivery.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter in full medieval armour while the rotors were hitting the hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humour is rather thin and strangely superfluous, especially now that franchises like James Bond and Mission: Impossible are adding comic ingredients without any trouble.
The humour seems to be aimed more at children than at adults, and for me the absurd mishaps of Johnny English are not as ingenious and well-timed as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr Bean.
Now, the oft-repeated argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the super-secret network of British spies, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent on duty, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and cornered figure who is seeing her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That is Johnny English, who is now teaching at a posh school, although he is giving unofficial lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy school like in School of Rock.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old pal Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man with a submariner captain, a role that is not exploited enough by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of Her Majesty return, with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic multi-millionaire from the world of technology who claims to be able to solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
y Bough embark on their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; and English becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta &apos; s house.
The last sequence was definitely exploited to the full, but, however charming and noisy it may be, the whole thing still gives a slightly childish impression.
A fairly regular product.
Like the other Johnny English films, I could not help wondering whether the British film industry might not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is planning to have Britons work four days a week and be paid for five.
The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week, but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the owners of companies to use the savings from the AI revolution to give their workers an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "fits" the party's economic plans and agenda and would tilt the country in favour of workers.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As one senior Labour Party figure commented to The Sunday Times: we are expecting an announcement of a review of the directive before the end of the year.
It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day working week is definitely a question that the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this kind of idea, as the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the general election in 2017.
However, at the moment, not all of the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: 'The four-day week is not party policy and is not going to be discussed at the moment.'
The shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was prepared to take back powers from 'anonymous directors' and 'interested' directors of companies that provide public services.
The shadow minister's plans also include the idea that existing shareholders in water companies will not get back all their money, as a Labour government could apply deductions to match the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds, with 10% of shares in private sector companies to be allocated to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court judge by at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the results of the investigation could influence any Republican Senator who is still wavering.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could produce information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, resolute, determined."
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would just dismiss the accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it emphatically," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the persons she names has been able to confirm this.
Thirty-six years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the 'Global Citizen Festival'? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive roster of stars will come together for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park &apos; s Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they can afford a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions," such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, making a phone call or any other action that raises awareness about their goal to end poverty.
What, however, has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of trying to reach its goal?
Is the idea of a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of 'clicktivism', the name given to the position we adopt when we think we are doing something really useful by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered over 19 million "actions" by its supporters in support of a wide range of goals.
Through these actions, they claim to have secured commitments and policies worth over $37 billion from global leaders that will impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements that had arisen from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition," a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom with a shared commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential." To that end, it has proposed to provide $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
Thanks to the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a small but significant step in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for "The Power of Nutrition," to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on our website about what we think can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen partner responded, "It will be a long and hard road and we will stumble and fall many times.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already shown, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are just some of the performances we have lined up for this year &apos; s New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA could use the Navy to enforce the energy export embargo on Russia - Interior Secretariat
In "some cases," Washington could call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up markets, including the Middle East, the United States Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, revealed in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia &apos; s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is merely a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe," he said.
Moreover, according to official information, there are ways and methods of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia, he warned, was basically to exploit and replace fuels, while indicating that Russia could only do one thing, which was to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These statements are made at a time when the Trump administration has been trying to push liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to take Russia's role away, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the 'unacceptable' Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has consistently insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is worth 11 billion US dollars and is intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington &apos; s fierce opposition to the project is motivated only by economic considerations and is yet another example of unfair competition.
I believe we all share the idea that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow last September.
The United States position has, however, met with rejection from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The organisation that leads the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a major problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will'seriously consider' running for president in 2020, she says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a visit to the Holyoke City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge is being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women in leadership, she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider standing for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a speech at City Hall and said that "he was taking the country down the wrong path."
I am really concerned about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from last Friday, Warren stated that 'it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote'.
A poll was published on Thursday, but a majority of Warren voters themselves do not believe that she should run for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of "potential" voters in Massachusetts said that Senator Kerry should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Some 32 per cent of those polled did, however, support his candidacy.
The poll showed increased support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent support for a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other well-known members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy in 2020 of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin &apos; s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"The situation my son is going through, everything that has happened since he came back, you know it well, the other families that suffer from the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers come back with," she said to the crowd gathered at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo nobody wants to talk about, and commented on her son and other veterans of war that "they come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering if there is really that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the army, have given to their country."
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a domestic violence complaint and possession of a firearm while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new United States policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a "friendly" brief in Washington on Friday to show their support for an asylum-seeker who is challenging the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" filed in August by the United States Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner and his children, who are members of a violent gang, abused her, but the United States officials denied her asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
Counsel representing these states who are defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum claims to the United States, as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum in the United States.
DC Attorney General Karl Racine made statements on Friday, saying that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal law, all asylum claims must be decided on the facts and circumstances of the claim and this exception violates that principle," the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also indicated in their brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by claiming that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide a necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
People who leave their countries of origin because of persecution or threats based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion may apply for asylum, Sessions said when he announced this directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all problems, let alone all serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us, &quot; The situation is very tense &quot;, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
"Ambulances are arriving every minute with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for whatever few belongings they have left in an effort to salvage what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, which were also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside the building because of the continued aftershocks, which were also very strong.
He could not help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he had experienced while on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the ruins of the fallen wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I do not know what has happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well."
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after a four-page advertisement in a United States newspaper by a Chinese government-run newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the United States ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the United States press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, the US President, Donald Trump, referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely circulated newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congress elections on 6 November, something that China denies vehemently.
The accusation launched by Trump on Beijing &apos; s attempt to influence the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are now locked in a growing trade war that has led them to raise tariff levels on imports from each other.
China &apos; s countervailing duties that were in place at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China "is intensifying this pressure with advertisements in our free press."
"In an attempt to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of free speech and press to try to place a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
Instead, in the newsstand in Beijing where we are now, there are only a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the diverse views that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that the economy of their country is taking, because the media are controlled by the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party."
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts note that the Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the mid-term vote with the Kavanaugh debacle
With many prominent Republicans rallying behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash could occur, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and many Republicans have said that they want to proceed with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday that "this is not a subject that can be reversed."
Reeher said he doubted that the latest attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself in favour of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters who were upset about the matter.
Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters gathered at the Senate doors were chanting "November is coming!" -- as the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is beyond all prediction," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, at the news site.
People say that the impact is already very significant and, indeed, it is.
But it could even be higher, especially among indecisive women in the outskirts and among the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote, even if they do not like the president."
Even before Ford &apos; s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had indicated that a backlash could occur if the Republicans pressed ahead with the confirmation.
This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as early as last week, according to NBC News.
It is not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or even whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench; it is also about how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be divided; they do not know whom to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are siding with Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe Ford &apos; s testimony definitively or probably, while 35 per cent say they believe Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony definitively or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied under oath, and 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake &apos; s push, the FBI is now investigating Ford &apos; s statements, as well as at least those of another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at age 17.
Ramirez, for his part, alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed his genitals to him at a party when he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project from the technology legend. A company based on the open source Berners-Lee Solid code platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "to dominate the world."
It has to be now," he said about the startup.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create their own 'personal data locker' or POD.
It can contain lists, lists of pending tasks, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique to online data storage is that the user is the one who decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls this 'personal data training'.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company &apos; s CEO, John Bruce, is to embed the resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
For the time being, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers on staff who were hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to 'Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change is going to be introduced where all their business models are going to be completely changed overnight.
We are not going to ask for permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on network neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about this coming era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lt-Col. Rev. Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
On Saturday, her two grandchildren found a memorial stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "particularly symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the decoration.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire."
He then ran to the front line and, with "great courage," advanced the line before reaching a single-handed gun and knocking out three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were "so great that I will never be able to reach his level, but they were very inspiring."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was attended by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for me to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is made clear when he is shown such a large support."
MMA fans stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but all they got was Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 only to be denied the main event.
The San Jose billboard featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was to be broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the United Kingdom were left stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
One Twitter follower described the change to cartoons as "a big joke."
There is government regulation of the content that is broadcast after 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when we asked him about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig" - yes.
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they will modify the programme to include British viewers in the next editions.
When I think about the option of retransmission, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it is at 6 a.m. on a Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are seeing how to do that.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a great many messages were received, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, because we thought it was a technical problem at first.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise that this will not happen again.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is what we normally do, and we tried to give more than usual to the fans, and we went over.
That is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, but that was what drove him to become a winner.
At 24, he told us that he did not realise until he went to secondary school that 'not everyone was like me'.
On the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that her intention in talking about gay rights was to 'give hope' to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to take less importance in winning at the Olympics.
The presenter of this legendary programme, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for a few months because of illness.
In the first Laverne, Daley, who had himself been a misfit, commented that he had felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood because "society did not accept that you liked boys and girls."
He said: "Until today, that sense of inferiority and difference has been what has really given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent face of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year &apos; s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he told this story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisal, and wanted to share that "hope" with others.
The three-time world champion said that it was a real surprise for her to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married last year to an Oscar winner, 20 years his junior, although he specified that the age difference had never been an issue.
When you live so much from such a young age (was at her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June, whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "overall perspective" had changed.
If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have been about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without doubt, Robbie's."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and indeed one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I was not able to tell him that I could not be in the front row," he recounted.
He had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it was only then that I realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
At that moment I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: to compete in the pool in front of my family at the Olympic Games, there was nothing better," he said.
This was also the inspiration behind his first choice of song, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him during the preparation for the Olympic Games and still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, sat out the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid it becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, was replaced by Captain Furyk for the Saturday four-ball and foursomes.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the five-time major champion had to settle for cheering at times and, at others, trying to improve his game on the field and thus rectify what ails him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not at his best on the long rough of Le Golf National, where errant shots are constantly punished.
And if the course is not sufficiently daunting, Mickelson, in the ninth round on Sunday, faces the brilliant Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, had started with such a flourish, Mickelson's match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, and he could not say much more.
He understood the role I had today, he gave me a pat on the back and, putting his arm around me, said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a great deal to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably did not imagine that playing two games.
We thought it would be more, but that is how it came out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of us."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo &apos; s record of most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a Ryder Cup career that never equalled his individual brand of excellence so clearly.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, although Furyk said that his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
He is "fun, sarcastic, clever, likes to wind people up; he is great to have in the team."
I think the younger players have really enjoyed having him as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It is much more than just a game."
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although he has a substantial advantage in the last few days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily turn into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Danes made their debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end only managed to tie the match, winning 14½-13½.
Bjorn, who was pictured after the 2018 generation won 5-3 on Friday and led by 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National, said: &quot; You keep reminding me that we had a great tournament at Valderrama; we also had a great tournament at Brookline and we lost, we had a great tournament at Valderrama and we won, but by the skin of our teeth. &quot;
History will teach me and everyone else that that team is not finished.
You have to give it your all tomorrow.
That is it, do what you have to do.
This does not stop until the points are on the board.
We have a target to meet, and that is to win this trophy, and that is all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, not one or two, but the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players had done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: 'I wouldn't want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is important tomorrow is individual action, and that is different.
It is great to share what is happening with a partner when things are going well, but when you are out there on your own, you are really testing your golfing ability.
That is the message that has to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner and go and find the best in yourself."
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be hoping that his players can do better individually than they did as a team, with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas the exceptions, who combined for three points out of four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the spectrum in the last few days of these great tournaments, being part of the winning team in Brookline and then losing when Europe pulled off the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
He remembered every word when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-majorities tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in the same direction, all the pressure is on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and they left with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow."
We gave Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and take on Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole trip," Bjorn said about his individual choices.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new frigate for the German Navy was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era vessels, but it will not be until at least next year because of faulty systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class of frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman as saying.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after the handover spoiled the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We know that it will include a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-missile missiles, and some technologies of invisibility, such as radar, infrared and very low acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, allowing for deployment for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continuing delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) will already be out of date when they start to serve, Die Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was the subject of a major controversy last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "crucial software and hardware defects" that would render the vessel virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half the number of personnel on the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy &apos; s ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is twice as heavy as other similar ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is estimated that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion), instead of the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy is 'losing ships that can deploy'.
The officer said that the problem has been getting worse over time, because old ships have been decommissioned, but not replaced.
It regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
National Trust spies on bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a Highland Scottish landscape, seeks to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
All findings are expected to shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton's bat and the long-eared brown bat in the gardens at Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
The experts will analyse the sounds recorded to discover the frequency of bat calls and which species make them.
A habitat report and map will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Conservation Adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be managed for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind,
Instead, owing to its nocturnal hunting habits, its hearing is more useful than its eyesight in achieving its prey.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescue operations.
The Trust has even opened the first and only reserve dedicated to bats in Scotland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
Here at Threave we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still much that is unknown about bats, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before maintenance work is carried out within the property, as a breeding colony could be unintentionally destroyed and up to 400 females and young could be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, or to destroy their colonies.
The Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elisabeth Ferrell, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: 'We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we do not know how their populations are evolving.'
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers sue German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has dismissed the rape allegations as 'fake news', saying that people are 'out for fame' at his expense.
His lawyers had been instructed to lodge a complaint against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which had published the statements.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward is accused of raping a woman from the United States, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying $375 000 to conceal the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already garnered 142 million followers just hours after the news broke, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," he says, looking straight into the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but I cannot help it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," he added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations that appeared in what they have called "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player &apos; s room, where he, allegedly, raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good guy" and that he had let him down by the "one per cent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of reprisals" and was concerned about being "humiliated in public."
The woman, who is 34 years old, claims that she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a big club in Italian football, on a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: the UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if we lost our global lead in car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'concerning' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily halted.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced around 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that, if Britain breaks away from the EU at the end of March, there will be production bottlenecks in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement, particularly in relation to cross-border trade; these include Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers relate to the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is based on the just-in-time (JIT) method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than one day &apos; s inventory in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted in that case.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, which sets out the future relationship with the EU, is 'tuned precisely to avoid these checks at the border'.
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only allows us to get out of this in the best possible way at this time, but we have to take the opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
Toyota's evidence, among many others, is that we have to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful supply chain."
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union rep at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: 'From my experience, once those jobs go, they never come back.'
A government spokesman said: 'We have put in place a clear and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week" as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump might fire the deputy attorney general or not and thus compromise the independence of Mueller has fuelled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein secretly recorded his conversations with President Trump with a microphone he wore himself in an attempt to remove the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, amidst reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he &quot; would prefer not &quot; to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would mean delaying the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump &apos; s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: 'No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the spot and I will inform the press, as I usually do."
Some journalists would dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since 10 September.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said that the shortage of press was not due to a dislike of TV journalists who were grandiloquent, although he said: 'I would not quarrel with the fact that they are grandiloquent.'
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The President has more Question Time than any previous President, he said, adding, without evidence, 'We have checked those numbers'.
Press briefings will continue, said Sanders, but "if the press has the option of asking the President of the United States directly, I think that is much better than asking me.
We have tried to do this many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when leaving the White House or when participating in public sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
Indeed, this week in New York, the President demonstrated why this is so, with a casual and sometimes bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
EU Health Secretary writes to NHS Scotland workers about their fears over Brexit
The UK Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU team working in the Scottish HSE to express the gratitude of the country and its wish to continue working with them post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the cost of applications for citizenship for EU nationals working in non-devolved public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: 'Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit continued, with the expectation that decisions would be taken this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom Government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know that all this must be very confusing for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each individual staff member, regardless of nationality.
EU and other professionals bring valuable experience and many skills to reinforce and enhance the work of the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to have you with us."
Christion Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a player for the Tennessee State Tigers, was taken to hospital for emergency surgery after suffering a head injury last Saturday when the Tigers lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
He "came over to the side and fell over," said Reed.
Both the trainers and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touchline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him off for a thorough examination.
A staff member at the Tennessee State Hospital told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there was no detail as to the type of injury or damage" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before being subbed off, adding a total of 18 tackles for the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher transfer tax when purchasing property in the UK
Foreigners will be hit with a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised by this measure will be used to house the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The change will neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the transfer of land tax will be applied to those who are not paying tax in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year for the homeless.
The additional money raised from the increase in the stamp duty on foreign buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the homeless, announced Theresa May today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralise the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in the land transfer tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivise the government's policy to tackle begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is an addition to the current stamp duty, also includes the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the 'buy-to-let' system, which could reach up to 3%.
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year from this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not reside in the United Kingdom, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's most affluent areas (especially the capital) have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people get on the housing ladder.
He accused the big builders of keeping property prices high by buying land in bulk without any intention of building on it, and urged Mrs May to remove the affordable housing quotas to solve the'shameful problem of housing' in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a very attractive series of reforms for housing, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: 'Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
That means sorting out the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people to achieve and the humiliation of sleeping on the streets is still too real."
Jack Ross: 'My primary objective is to lead Scotland'
The Sunderland coach says that his "primary objective" is to become a Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited by the prospect of reviving the club in the north-east, which currently occupies third place in League One (the third tier of English leagues), three points behind the leader.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B hat," he recounted on Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a boy and that has always made me want to come back.
This opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I can successfully run a club."
Amongst the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he moved to such established names in such a big club, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, success for me is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and the facilities of this club are certainly at Premier League level," he said.
It is not easy to achieve, but I would only consider that I have achieved my aim here when I can return the club to where it should be."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, having spent time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell in the Hearts technical department.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and took St. Mirren from being on the brink of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims that he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled that it was probably a 'crossroads' moment when he took over at Alloa.
I always believed that management was what I was best at, far more than playing.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I could make a living out of it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer from stress and pressure from that work, but I feel good in the direction.
I always wanted to train and now I have managed to do so, it is the time of my adult life when I have felt best, without a doubt."
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound on Monday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Radio Scotland.
According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday
The summer heatwave has boosted takings in British pubs struggling to survive, but it has concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA Business Consulting, which compiled the figures, commented: 'The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have still meant that July has kept the pattern of the previous month of June, when pubs increased their turnover by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants have even fallen a little further.
The 1.8% fall in retail trade in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, against the majority of restaurants, where profits fell.
Pubs that serve mainly meals also suffered from the heat, although not as drastically as restaurant operators.
People seem to want to go out just to drink.
In managed bars and pubs, sales of beverages rose by as much as 6.6 per cent during the month, while meals fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the home-based activities market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8% fall in sales compared with last year is going to be particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering industry and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents &apos; backs
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts behind their parents &apos; and teachers &apos; backs, according to a survey
The survey, conducted among 20,000 secondary school students, revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages
News reports have heightened fears of the publication of sexually explicit material
20% of pupils have a "main" account that they show to their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) create social media accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears of the publication of sexual content.
Some 20 per cent of pupils said they had a "main" account that they showed to their parents, while having other private accounts.
A mother who happened to come across her 13-year-old daughter &apos; s secret site saw an adolescent encouraging others to "violate" her.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged between 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel the need to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the 'voice of the athletes' in the Scottish Athletics Federation's new directive
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland &apos; s most decorated athlete on track and field and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want sport to benefit from its great international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish, UK and world athletics community, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from her being in charge," said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can bring things and help develop sport in Scotland.'
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between the four golds he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischaemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: 'One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or to what extent I would recover.
It was exhausting, but I managed to recover completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am now doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the breast pump, which compares mothers to cows, divides opinion on the Internet
A breast-pump company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing mothers who breastfeed to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is in theory the 'world &apos; s first silent breast pump', consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a video with a bit of irony showing mothers counting the freedom their new breast pump gives them.
Four real women dance in a hayloft, as a dancefloor, together with cows, with letters such as 'Yes, I do it myself, but I do not have a tail' and 'Just in case you have not noticed, they are not udders, they are my breasts'.
The chorus continues: 'Order her, order her, I am feeding her babies, order her, order her, I am milking my women.'
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company &apos; s Facebook page, has created a great deal of controversy.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it succeeds in putting the spotlight on the 'horrors' of the dairy sector.
It is a very unfortunate decision to have cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before they can give birth to produce milk, with the exception that they take their babies away from them days after they are born," wrote one person.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly attached to a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who stay at home with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a ridiculous announcement."
However, others defended the advertisement, including a woman who admitted that the song was &quot; annoying &quot;.
I think it is a great idea.
If it were still suckling, it would certainly have one.
When I used the pump, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but I am not going to dwell on it.
It is a wonderful product," said one woman.
Another person commented: 'It is a funny announcement for mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector."
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside their brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the nursing bra, allowing users to move, hold their babies and even go out into the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, a Mother partner and ECD, comments: &quot; The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time that the Elvie bomb has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant minors quietly relocated to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased significantly, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has remained at near-normal levels. This is partly due to the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be fingerprinted and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Around 80 per cent of the sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
We are still pursuing these people,” said Albence.
In their drive to process juveniles more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from the time of arrest, instead of 60 days, as the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will testify by video conference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for amparo will be deported as soon as possible.
According to workers at the reception centres and reports from the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they are held in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the advocates, these concerns are even more heightened in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of distress in these children will be overlooked.
Moreover, the move to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause trauma to many of them who are already suffering.
Syria calls on the &quot; occupying forces &quot; of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country &apos; s war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the matter would be dealt with accordingly.
He told the assembly that they must "immediately and unconditionally" withdraw.
Moualem insisted that the &quot; war on terrorism is practically over &quot; in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of all terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns, &quot; he said.
They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats assert that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel bastion of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had “clear time limits” and expressed the hope that military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front (al-Qaeda-linked), who would be “eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy, is expected to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the terms for the Syrian government &apos; s participation in the committee, arguing that the panel &apos; s work should be restricted to &quot; reviewing the articles of the current constitution &quot; and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will doubtless hope, a dismissal or a scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would certainly be 'the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!'
There are no signs of fatigue among the spectators at the moment.
Since 2014, the ratings for the prime-time hours have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and have nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the peak audience hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has surpassed cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for the top evening news programs.
It is a strange attraction that we have yet to understand, says Neal Baer, the executive producer of &quot; Designated Survivor &quot;, a dramatic series on ABC about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Another theory comes from Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of &quot; Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys &apos; Club &quot;.
He recalls a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him that he would vote for Trump.
Why?
Scovell was told, "Because it makes me laugh."
Chaos is always in the ascendant in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
But the information overloads you when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear," the $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket of Paul Manafort ("a piece of over-the-top vanity," in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels &apos; scabrous descriptions of Trump &apos; s anatomy.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
Offering something new every night is what makes everything seem like a reality show, says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of &quot; Pawn Stars &quot;, when he talks about the alternating Trump show and its daily plot twists (whether it &apos; s going into a fight with the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You cannot afford to miss an episode if you do not want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
I remember when we were doing all those crazy programmes back then and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilisation.
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows into the mid-term election of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that money is flowing into Pennsylvania's 17th District, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election to the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, recently redesigned, is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another Republican challenger, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former Pennsylvania 12th District, a district that overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding contest between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight Washingtonian hiccup.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Trump Organization were evicted by the management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of the United States diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of &quot; recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan &quot;, said Heather Nauert, the department &apos; s spokeswoman, in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received some US$ 140 million in aid in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, United States and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials in the Administration made it clear that their intention was for the conference to proceed, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, and which diplomats see as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three United States envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House in Bolton rejected commenting on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be the report of the special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also thought to be investigating the possibility that the Trump campaign worked in tandem with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable by that body, just as he is preparing to run for re-election and perhaps, finally, for a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and I am not suggesting that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable, or that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to take decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History turns on these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy quickens or slows down.
The Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good place since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the President and speculating about his unfitness for office.
Rosenstein says that The Times &apos; explanation is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
On top of all this, will we vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will have a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador &apos; s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles at the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play on Thursday at home against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"We got a good result, Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing that we could get something and we ended up with a point.
We might have won in the end, but on the whole the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and we were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get all three points, but it will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game. But with all the fans behind us, I am sure we can get a good result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be all right.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying themselves tremendously and we are having a good training.
I hope that we can move forward, put last season behind us and achieve success."
The fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their families.
About half of the people who participated in Nationwide &apos; s study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the steps to have that conversation, says Holly Snyder, Nationwide &apos; s vice president of life insurance.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options may be a determining factor in the cost.
Include your financial adviser in the conversion, as he may also be able to help you find a way to pay for it.
Their options for long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help them cover costs or insure themselves with their own savings, if they have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Ensure that a medical power of attorney is obtained to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
It may also draw up a notarial power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don &apos; t forget the small details: imagine your elderly father is having a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions on medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
It is not just money that is at stake: 'Which doctors do we have to treat?' asks Martin.
What medicines are you taking?
Who will look after the dog?
Everything has to be planned.
Man shot several times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
They shot at a man with a rifle several times as he was walking home after dark.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (BST), as "random."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police had appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications blocked, aid workers have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the north-west of Sulawesi island.
The Regency, which is an administrative region that is hierarchically subordinate to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is often struck by earthquakes.
We now summarize some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on 26 December triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of the victims in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of deaths were reported on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coastline, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, it did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, was hit by a series of large earthquakes, killing more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake had devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists had been temporarily evacuated.
Sarah Palin &apos; s eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged offences, he took the phone away from her.
Palin was taken into custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, KTUU reported.
He was presented before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked to give his statement, the channel reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could mean up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, she was charged with assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the reporting of a domestic violence offence and being in possession of a firearm while intoxicated in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had punched him in the face.
Several veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son &apos; s violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after a quake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7.5 triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communications networks have been down and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just to the side of the Sulawesi centre, which is located in the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspect in New York terrorist attack
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot pickup truck to carry out a bike lane attack in October last year on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed &quot; intentionally &quot; the eight victims and caused &quot; intentionally &quot; serious bodily injury, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death sentence, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which federal prosecutors often use in such cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to the prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, the notice of claim states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be flown in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they are &quot; obviously disappointed &quot; with the decision by the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea with a life sentence without parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved, &quot; said Patton.
Saipov &apos; s defence team had previously requested the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to'mobilise the people's army' today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to 'feel the heat' of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should handle the EU negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Nigel Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May in trying to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even further by a group of Tories in favour of remaining joining a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers compromise on track in the face of attacks from the Brexiters, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Leave Means Leave MP, Damian Bone, said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now, he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: 'I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers'.
In his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: 'I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public at large does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: &quot; Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises &quot;.
Farage told the crowd that the politicians would have to be "shaken up" if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
We are going to mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the pro-Europeans marched through the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved Tories Against Brexit placards after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with an application of the party during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be called a good Brexit, he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for the presidency
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all options" for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth town hall meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
A staff member asked him if he was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes having a woman at the top.
One arrested for the shooting death of LSU football player Sims
The Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims the previous Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University early on Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the crime scene, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98m player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the orders from the Mercedes team would play a major role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of the picture by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was first into the pits and left Hamilton to run in the slipstream, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strongly a lap later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton got past after a wheel-to-wheel battle that left the Ferrari driver having to give up the inside line at risk of being passed again after a double move to defend at Turn 3.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first race.
He then led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
Finally, he made a pit stop on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen regained fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman in letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job in finding a perfect match, &quot; said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ms. Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were people who were "bad, repugnant and false."
"The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening these days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false," he said.
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say 'But I didn't do it.
I did not do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? - 'Oh, oh, what?
Oh no.
I did not leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
Have we leaked? No, we have not leaked,....
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that it came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford &apos; s allegations, I did not leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I did.
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the president, who during the Saturday night rally commented as follows: "I will tell you something: that was really bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen."
Continuing his defence of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don &apos; t care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get the power and the control, &quot; said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made amends for their defeat on Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return game on Saturday by 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants took an early lead of two goals thanks to strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local score before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen &apos; s two goals secured the victory.
This was the third defeat in a row for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer &apos; s first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) with an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what could be considered a very lively opening period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt tied the game at 15:16 with a Cownie assist.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized with a goal in the 27th minute, 37 seconds.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the final seconds of the second half and the victory was secured with the fifth goal of the game in the final seconds.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the earthquake plane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after dying in the line of duty to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to rock the area, and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, which was being buffeted by strong winds.
It held its position to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped from the air traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told ABC News that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand. The national disaster mitigation agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of victims is expected to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people have not been contacted, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Tsunami waves as high as six metres have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible with the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country &apos; s military: &quot; I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
CNN reported that the United States was ready.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after the air crash in a lagoon in Micronesia
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing, after saying that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that since Saturday evening, no male passenger had been accounted for.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to assist in rescuing the other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The airline and the United States Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the aircraft had overrun the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very low.
That was "extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes comments that he and other passengers were able to move forward in water that reached their waists to the emergency exits of the aircraft which was beginning to sink.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Navy said that sailors working on a nearby dock improvement project also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A timeline of the night a woman was burned alive is presented by an analyst
The prosecution finished its arguments on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to track the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, contradicting his earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers &apos; s during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
The mobile phone records indicated that they had only met one week earlier.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers &apos; death, Tellis deleted Chambers &apos; messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "She was erased from her life."
The defence is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would be in the hands of the jury that very day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the gender.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Acts such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Or another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a "racist" text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was &quot; another black person &quot;.
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the complaint to a case of "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to discover that the new childminder, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” she wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mauritius twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "discomforted" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his former nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that he was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mauritius was paid for one day &apos; s work and sent home by Uber.
Mauritius is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with a view to receiving compensation of $350 per day for the six months &apos; work for which she had been hired, although without a contract.
He told The Post on Friday, "I want to show them that things are not done that way," adding, "I know it is a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that Maurice &apos; s employment was terminated for the most reasonable reason, as they feared that they could not trust him after he offended them.
My wife had sent him something that she did not want to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racists," said the husband, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn baby?
Come on!
Comparing the demand to "extortion," Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to go for someone like that?
That is not a very decent thing to do,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks, criticizing their behaviour and their logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond &apos; s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: &quot; It was hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before publication.
It is very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who had worked as a BBC page boy before writing the children &apos; s book, had hoped to be rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was &quot; bittersweet &quot; after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very quiet man and did not like to boast, he said.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, even if it was not really your achievement.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in that way.
Although he was its creator and its product, he always gave credit to the original Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
On landing, her daughter was rushed to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“She would call regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that it was not expected that she would succeed,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
I then received a call from Nad to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said to him, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear."
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were slowly wearing off and leaving his system.
She had died too soon and everything was fading.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not scream, cry or shout because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand my ground on this one.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was about to undergo.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
I bent my head and tears were constantly falling.
It is difficult to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much I loved him.
Women in mourning cards to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I do not want any father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile lit up any place.
However, he left his work before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler &apos; s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his life.
Ms Davis said: 'I am constantly worried that it might have an impact'.
Davis created the cards "so people know there are people to go to and people to talk to, even if it &apos; s a friend."
You have to talk about it, you cannot keep quiet about it.
Ms. Humphreys, who is a friend of Davies &apos; s for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother &apos; s death.
He did not say he was depressed or anything like that, he tells us.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day, the nadir was reached: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to get over it: "It leaves a void in the whole family.
It has left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought if we could really get something like what he was asking for (a limited time, limited scope investigation), maybe we could bring a little unity to it,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going off the rails” in the midst of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to proceed?
The refusal is entirely due to the timing.
There are only five weeks to go to the mid-term elections on 6 November, and if the Republicans do badly, their attempts to elect the man they want to the highest court in the land will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife, Ashley, who was the President &apos; s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
North Korean desertions &quot; fall &quot; with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said that 1,127 people had deserted last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by people smugglers, had been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on this.
The vast majority of defectors from the north are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and they are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved remarkably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea &apos; s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States sanctions for the lack of progress.
Without US confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm, Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysteric" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I cannot help but think if a woman had acted in that way, they would have called her hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny the allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and choking up as he spoke about his family and his years of high school.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her view, Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats,
Pelosi objected when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
Pelosi said, "I will say one thing: if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, he will not be fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court he is on now."
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
This is not the time for an hysterical, impartial person to go to court and expect us to think everything is fine, said Pelosi.
And women must take it up.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury spilling out, and she cannot let it go without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I do not think that is so unusual, is it?"
She continued: &quot; I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in a company and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and started to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to: &apos; Perhaps you think I am sad because I am crying.
No, I am not angry, I am not angry at all.
And then he went back to what he was doing.
I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger partly because they are not really understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once when I found myself crying with an unexpressed rage. A senior woman manager, a woman I had always been slightly afraid of, grabbed me by the throat and dragged me up a staircase.
He said to me, "Never let them see you cry."
They have no idea that you are angry.
They think you are sad and they will be happy because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board a boat called Monkey Business, which forced him to withdraw from the presidential race, deeply frustrated Schroeder came up with the idea of her running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision," he said to me with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
We were referred to as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
As the campaign was already well under way, it fell behind in fund-raising, so it was promised that it would not re-enter the race unless it raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?”, she wondered.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome with emotion (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on voter recruitment rather than delegate recruitment, and anger at sexism) that she choked.
"It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
You might have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
Did he 'cry'?”
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still a long way to go before the battle is over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning in early 2018 by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods, taxing half of the goods that come into the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent on $60 billion worth of American products.
China has committed to matching the United States, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will soon ease up.
To back down would mean yielding to the demands, but to submit to the United States publicly would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, the experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the United States &apos; trade war could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a rapid policy decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a crash in the economy in either country is actually far more dangerous than has been recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, an associate fellow focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria ready to receive refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria asserts that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country &apos; s conditions were improving.
The situation on the ground is today more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an effort to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods were now in place.
UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States now has six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last win in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish team of Captain Thomas Bjorn won the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, hit his tee shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, conceding defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever post a 5-0-0 record since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one Dustin Johnson was beaten 2 and 1 by Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio García became the European Ryder Cup player with the most wins in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points in his career.
I do not usually cry, but today I cannot help it.
It has been a very hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for having chosen me and for having believed in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to get the cup back.
It was a team effort and I am very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team won.
The torch is now being passed to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday by 2 and 1 in a singles match.
I felt incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods, because I grew up watching this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf all week.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team &apos; s disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these boys, they never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we spoil it.
I would like to congratulate Mr Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Your 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
It is now our turn to hang our heads in shame.
They have surpassed us.
