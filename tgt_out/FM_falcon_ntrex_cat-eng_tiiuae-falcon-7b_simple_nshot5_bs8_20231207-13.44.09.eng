Members of the Galician parliament are concerned that "the Muppets are being identified with Galicia."
Several members of the assembly have expressed their consternation at the proposal to change the title of their members from "Member of the Welsh Parliament" to "Member of the Welsh Assembly".
This controversy has arisen from a proposal to change the name of the Parliament to the Galician Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have expressed their concern that this measure could become a source of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee has said that the party is concerned about the possibility that MWP might merge with Twp or Pwp.
For the readers who don't speak Galician: In Galician, "twp" means "stupid" and "pwp" means "shit."
A member of Plaid Cymru's assembly has commented that his party "hasn't got a clue" and has proposed various alternatives.
For their band, a conservative member has said that their group is "open" to the change of name, but he has also commented that there is a big difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, we can say that the letter "w" in Galician is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in English from Yorkshire.
According to the committee in charge of drafting the law to introduce the changes: "The final decision on what to call the members of the assembly will be made by the assembly members themselves."
The 2017 law of the government of Galicia gives the Assembly of Galicia the power to change its name.
In June, the committee will publish the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with a broad support for the proposal to change the name of the parliament to the Galician Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, even though the committee is going to vote for "Members of the parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one that is going to get the most support in the public consultation.
As it seems, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, it is possible to achieve a consensus on one of them for the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal opinion on the changes in question in the coming weeks.
The reform will also include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will celebrate the final vote on their name during the debate related to the legislation.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The citizens of Skopje will vote on Sunday whether or not to change the name of their country to "Republic of Macedonia of the North."
The plebiscite is going to decide a dispute that has been going on for decades with Greece, which already has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time that the name of its northern suburb represents a way of reclaiming its territory and has repeatedly opposed the intentions of this country to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, has said he will ignore the results of the referendum on changing the country's name.
On the other hand, those who are against it, such as the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“Historically, there was a bar and a church in every hamlet,” says Mr. Adams.
“Today, not in decline, but in fall.”
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars is possible to understand.
“The people have a different way of socialising today,” he says.
“The bars are no longer the seedy places they used to be. They are now frequented by people from all walks of life.”
For the churches, it is a concern that the dinners they sell will not last as long as the leaders expect them to, and that they will have to return to the church late at night.
Churches, synagogues, and mosques could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the same type of people who will not be able to help the churches that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white people,” he says, “and because of that, it will accelerate the decline of all churches, since it is unlikely that the majority of the people who move to these buildings will be members of these churches.”
Two of the three white churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a predominantly black neighborhood; Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in the Fields in 1962.
The white Methodist congregation has been there since the 1930s.
A black congregation has bought the building.
St. Martin's will be led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who will lead a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, one of the main commercial streets of Harlem, which is known for its resistance to contracting or promoting people of African descent.
In 1939, a fire caused great damage to the building, and when the Reverend Johnson's congregation decided to rebuild the church, it was then that the plans for the carillon were drawn up.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of the Reverend Johnson and successor to the Reverend Johnson at St. Martin's, will describe the church bells as "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who is going to sound the carillon in July is going to describe it in a different way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, will also observe that the first carillon of the world is to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who is going to transfer the carillon to Riverside Church for the first time in 18 years.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's is not going to be replaced.
St. Martin's has not sounded its bells for the last two months, however, there have been complications with the architects and contractors, some of whom have been led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish, is to write to the diocese this month expressing its concern that the diocese "pretends to pass on the costs" to the parish council, even though it will not be involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the diocese is going to send.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was mauled to death by a bull while searching for wildflowers in California.
A bull is going to attack and gore a 13-year-old boy this Saturday while he was searching for rattlesnakes in California, the first day of rattlesnake season, according to authorities.
The attack is scheduled to take place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As explained by Chad Hammel to KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been bussing for about an hour with some friends the morning of Saturday when he started feeling the effects of a new demand for help.
Hammel said that the first thing he thought of was the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he realized that he had been caught!
He had his whole collarbone stripped
“For everyone who leaves the water, I call out: 'There's a bull in the water!'”, said Hammel.
We are going to be transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where we are going to be admitted in a difficult state.
We don't know which species of bull is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, the paramedic Larry Giles will say that he had detected a bull in the area, but that he had decided that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles is going to say that the victim suffered severe head trauma in the upper part of the torso.
The authorities will be closing the beaches from Ponto Beach to Swami's Beach for 48 hours due to the investigation and for security reasons.
Giles will point out that there are more than 135 species of bull in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans for Sainsbury's, a supermarket chain in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's has decided to take on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a range of beauty products in the style of those found in the big department stores.
These great passes are only part of a considerable investment in the market for beauty products in the United Kingdom, a market that is worth some 2.8 billion pounds and which continues to grow while the sectors of fashion and beauty products are lagging behind, and which will be able to open 11 new stores across the country this year in order to expand further.
The investment in beauty products is driven by the desire of the supermarkets to make the most of the space they have available to sell their products that were previously destined for televisions, microwaves and other kitchen appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double its beauty range to 3,000 products by the end of the year, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also have more space for brands that are similar to the ones that can be found in Boots.
The supermarket chain is also in the process of re-launching its range of beauty products under the "Boutique" brand, so that the majority of its products are suitable for vegans, an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The fragrance chain The Fragrance Shop is to open two concessions in Sainsbury's stores. The first will open in Croydon, south of London, next week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The Internet has changed the way we buy food and the way we buy it in smaller quantities each day at smaller supermarkets has meant that the big supermarkets have had to find other ways to convince the public to buy.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, the stores will be assembled into larger stores in a bid to take on the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced points of sale for Argos in many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores which it will acquire in full later this year.
The original intention of the chain of hypermarkets to launch their departments of beauty products and pharmacy has resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's will be conducting a joint operation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but it will end in disaster.
This new strategy comes after the sale of 281 Sainsbury's stores to Celesio, the owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have an important role in the global market, as it will expand its range of luxury brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have changed the appearance of our past products in order to improve the environment for our customers."
We have hired a number of specialists who will be of great help when it comes to offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the surrounding area and the practical location make it one of the most attractive destinations for beauty products and cosmetics.
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby was paid 11 million pounds for her appearance on a TV show
Dragons' Den's Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby, the presenter of TV show This Morning, signed a deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV worth £11 million.
Willoughby doesn't have the time to devote himself to the negotiation of products from the factory and accessories Truly.
The negotiations between these two media personalities had reached a point where they were being compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, who is 37 years old, is going to use Instagram to announce her pregnancy.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones furious by quitting the show in the last minute of a lucrative sponsorship deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which she will also be involved in.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the red star of television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the company's central office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the contracts of the presenter, for a value of 1.5 million pounds, would imply that she would no longer have time to devote to the joint brand of products from the company and accessories Truly.
The negotiations had arrived at comparing Goop with the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and wanted to double the fortune of Willoughby, estimated at 11 million GBP.
When Willoughby is 37 years old, he will use Instagram to announce his marriage to Jones, who will take a private jet to one of his vacation homes outside of the United Kingdom.
According to a source: "Truly it was Holly's top priority."
It was intended to be the future terminus and we would see it for the next thirty or forty years.
His decision not to run for re-election will leave a void for all the parties involved.
No one could believe that it was going to happen on Tuesday, we were so close...
There is also a room full of merchandise at Marlow's central office that can be viewed.
According to the experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the brightest stars of the British television, could cost the company millions of pounds due to the important investment that had been made in products, from crockery and glassware to cutlery and table linen.
In addition, it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been maintaining a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for some time now.
Willoughby will join forces with Capp in 2016, and Jones, who is 52 years old, will join the company as president in March.
The two of them spend their holidays together. In addition, Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!
A proper font for Jones to comment on is "We will not be making any comments on our negotiations."
Tough accusations... "and then we'll fall in love"
They are making fun of the possible criticisms that would come from the media for making a comment that some would consider "out of place from a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the leader of North Korea.
Why has Trump given up so much?
Trump is going to say, "I'm going to make America great again."
“I haven't given up yet.”
It is interesting to note that Kim had an interest in celebrating a second meeting after the first meeting held in Singapore in June was declared a great success in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June 12 summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho is expected to comment on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to its recent initiatives for denuclearization.
Notably, the United States continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's point of view, in contrast, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
We are declaring war on North Korea.
Millions of people have lost their lives.
We maintain this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong-un have had positive results: a freeze in missile tests, aid for the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
I will be defending my usual focus on the relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but when you have 10,000 people trying to get into this place, and you only have 200, that’s a lot of people,” Trump said, addressing the crowd that had gathered in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths caused by a tsunami and a volcanic eruption in Indonesia
After the landslide in Lombok, for example, it will be clear to other governments that they were not necessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of the population of Lombok will have to be relocated, the government will not declare a national disaster, in order to be able to request international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, so the situation is very urgent,” says Mrs. Sumbung.
If Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it's not sure that foreign people can work on the land.
Mr. Sutopo, head of the national disaster agency, is going to comment that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if it is possible or not for international agencies to provide assistance.
The constant earthquakes that plague Indonesia, the country remains woefully unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Even though Aceh has built tsunami refuges, they are not common in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami sirens in Palu, even though there was a warning in effect, is likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the enormous number of islands in Indonesia is, in the best of cases, like a reptile.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was stranded in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu; meanwhile, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
The president Joko Widodo's central element of his election campaign was the betterment of Indonesia's infrastructure, and he has spent enormous amounts of money on roads and railways.
Meanwhile, the government of Joko is facing the challenge of having to deal with a budget deficit.
Joko also faces pressure from the permanent tensions between the country's majority Muslim population and its Christian minority.
More than 1000 deaths and 10,000 displaced people are the result of the battles that take place on the roads between Christian and Muslim gangs with bows, arrows, and other bloodthirsty weapons.
Observe: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores the equalizer with a header in front of the Chelsea goal
Daniel Sturridge is going to save Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge is going to break a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to within 27 meters of the goal of Chelsea when his team was losing 1-0.
The pilot is going to move to the left before making an incredible turn to the second lap.
The shot is going to create the whole area with a great elevation while propelling the ball to the right side of the goal.
In the end, the pilot is going to start the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in order to try to avoid it and will end up at the bottom of the network.
“I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always try to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible,” says Sturridge on LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch and I didn’t even think about it, I just wanted to shoot.”
Chelsea won 1-0 after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In the play, the left winger for the Blue team, Mateo Kovacic, made a pass to the right winger, who then sprinted to the Liverpool team's goal and scored.
Kovacic is going to make a quick combination from the middle of the pitch.
After that, he made a magnificent pass in depth, leaving Hazard in the area with the ball under control.
Hazard is going to score the second goal with a shot from the left side of the penalty area that Alisson Becker will not be able to reach.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday, September 15 at 3:00 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
The Chelsea, for their part, will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to figures from the country's disaster relief agency.
Many people will be trapped between the ruins of collapsed buildings as a result of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that will take place on Friday and which will cause floods of up to 6 metres, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, will be completely covered by the rubble of the destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was found stabbed to death.
The investigation into the murder began after the body of the woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The woman, aged 44, was found at 7:55 a.m. with various stab wounds at Grayson Mews, John Street; shortly after, a man aged 32 was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have asked the residents of the area if they have seen or heard anything that might be related to the crime in front of the authorities.
According to Detective Chief Inspector Brian O'Hagan: "If the investigation is still in its early stages, we would like to hear from anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who may have seen or heard anything suspicious."
I would also like to make a plea to any taxi driver who may have seen anything, even if it is just a small detail, that could help with the investigation.
A police officer has confirmed that the woman is from Birkenhead and that she will be found in a property.
This evening, friends who think they know the woman have come to the scene of the crime to ask questions about what happened this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are looking for information from the victim's closest family members.
A taxi driver who saw Grayson Mews was trying to drive into the building, but the police told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When you succeed, you don't need words.
It is being noticed by the residents that they will have to wait hours to get back in.
It will be able to feel like a police officer explaining to a man that the entire area is covered with the scene of the crime.
A woman is going to appear on stage crying.
He keeps repeating, "It's terrible!"
At 14:00, two police vans were found parked outside the cordoned-off area with their engines running.
A number of Romanian agents are patrolling the area around the block of flats.
Anyone who can provide information about this incident is asked to contact Merseyside Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, quoting reference number 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Oliver Cromwell in the British Parliament is the latest monument to be affected by the debate over "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a matter of poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England by his fanatical followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "bogeria" and an "intent to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would become one of the main objects of contention.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not going to be ordered or ended by Cromwell.
It is possible that Cromwell would have been executed incorrectly for the actions of his predecessor in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Oliver Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe deserves to be commemorated.
Goldsmith will tell The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps most, at the end of the 19th century, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy."
If this fet constitutes a totally accurate representation of Roman history.
What is certain is that the conflict of media of the 17th century will shape the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a band of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A pig kills a farmer
A farmer is attacked and killed by a wild boar in a market in the south-west of China, according to local reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an artery cut and covered in pig blood at the market of Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, according to the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines at a farm in Xining, the capital of Qinghai province.
According to reports, he had traveled from the province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, he will find the dead man and discover a door leading to a pigsty next door.
According to him, there was a big pig with a lot of blood on its mouth.
The forensic examination will confirm that the 250 kg man had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My brother had his eyes gouged out and his ears cut off,” says Wu, whose name is given as “Wu” according to news reports from Guiyang.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body will be found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the property of either Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market's managers is going to comment on the news of the evening that the pig is going to be slaughtered and butchered in order to avoid any further attacks, while the police gather the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, the family of Yuan and the managers of the market are negotiating an indemnity for Yuan's death.
Although they are not very common, there have been previous cases of wild pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig is going to attack a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
In the past, a wild boar weighing 300 kg was caught by a farmer who had to wait until his wife could scare it away from his tractor.
After a farmer in Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba is going to tell the CBC news that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They like to play.
They're just kids, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't have the idea of doing harm.
Only by giving them the respect they deserve, he will comment.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the south-west of the United States.
According to the predictions, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters of the north coast of Mexico.
The Rosa is expected to bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States for the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, equivalent to a category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 am local time on Monday, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that the Rosa will be displaced northward on Wednesday.
On the other hand, a depression is starting to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving towards the west coast of the United States. When the Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, it will become a tropical storm.
Rosa is expected to dump up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
In addition, the tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate torrential downpours over the entire south-west during the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause flash floods, debris flows, and the possibility of landslides.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 50 to 75 mm per hour in various parts of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to receive 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the south-west, especially in Arizona.
There is the possibility of forming rivers, as soon as the situation is getting worse very rapidly due to the dispersal of the tropical plugs.
It is completely unadvisable to enter the desert before the threat of tropical rain.
Torrential downpours could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable rivers. In addition, storms could carry rats and clouds of poison gas to specific locations.
The depression will bring torrential downpours to coastal areas of southern California.
It is possible that there will be total precipitation of over 50 mm, which could cause minor flooding of roads and streams.
The first snowfalls of the winter season are expected in the region.
They will begin to arrive in Arizona from tropical downpours in the middle of the night to the early morning, before the downpours become more widespread.
Torrential downpours are expected to continue throughout Wednesday in the region of the Four Cantons.
In October there will be several important oscillations in temperature throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, as well as in the tropics.
This phenomenon can cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The region in the center of the U.S. is a clear example of drastic differences in temperature on the same day.
There have been differences in temperature of up to 20 °F (11 °C) between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will continue to expand.
It is expected that the month of October will start with a lot of heat in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-east.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, which would be 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-range forecast, there is a good chance that temperatures will be above average for the first half of October across much of the United States.
More than 20 million people are expected to watch Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing
More than 20 million viewers will be able to watch the passionate testimony of Brett Kavanaugh's accuser and the woman who will accuse him of sexual assault, which is expected to take place in the next few years, Christine Blasey Ford.
On the other hand, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting their usual Friday night programming due to a last-minute deal struck by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to continue its investigation into the car bombings for a week.
Ford is going to explain to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh was going to grope her and try to take her clothes off at a party at the institute.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, is going to say that he was absolutely convinced that this was not going to pass.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers will have watched the testimony on Friday.
The company counted the viewers of the major American television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The ratings for the hearing are not immediately available for other cable channels that will be retransmitting the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen has problems calculating the number of people who see the ads from his office.
Putting it in perspective, it's like a playoff game in American football or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the leaders of opinion of which have clearly given their support to the nomination of Kavanaugh, will be the channel with the most viewers, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the testimony of the whole day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC will be second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS will get 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest is still high after the testimony.
Flake will be the central figure of this week's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican Senator Jeff Flake released a statement saying they would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was caught on camera by CNN and CBS the next morning as he was trying to get into an elevator to go to a committee hearing on Kavanaugh.
Flake will recount various minutes with his head bowed while he was live on television for CNN.
“Here in front of you,” a woman will say.
“Do you think the truth is in the country?”
They say "you have power, while there are so many things that you don't have!"
Flake is going to say that his office has sent out a press release and, before the elevator doors close, is going to say that he has more to say to the committee.
In less than an hour, all cable and broadcast news channels were covering the moment when the Senate Judiciary Committee was about to vote on whether or not to confirm Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.
Flake is going to say, in a change of tone, that he only wants to know if the FBI will investigate the allegations against the nominee in the week before the election, as demanded by the minority of Democrats.
Flake is likely to be convinced by the conversations he will have with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several other senators, Flake will make his decision.
The triad option for Flake had influence, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the support of Democrats.
President Trump has ordered an investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British prime minister, Theresa May, has accused her critics of "playing politics" over Brexit.
Theresa May will accuse critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and the country's national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the Daily Telegraph, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson is expected to reinforce his attack on the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and the EU are recapturing is "totally absurd".
The assassination of Wayde Sims: The police have arrested Dyteon Simpson for the murder of the LSU football player
The police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities are going to release a video of the confrontation between the Simpsons and the Simpsons. According to the police, the Simpsons are going to lose their hair during the battle.
The police are going to recover the bodies at the scene of the crime and say they have found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS affiliate in Baton Rouge.
After questioning Simpson, this man will admit to having killed Wayde with a trebuchet.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.

“Things like this happen all the time,” Wade will say.
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano have arrived in barrels in the south of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention in Mexico will warn the Mexicans on Saturday that the volcano is still active after registering 183 emissions of gas and ash in a 24-hour period.
The center was supervising various sinkholes and tremors that have occurred recently.
Images of the xarxes socials show a fine layer of ash on the roofs of cars parked in the streets of Mexico City's Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico City in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The police are facing off with Catalan separatists just days before the anniversary of the referendum on Catalan independence
Protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes with police during a demonstration in favour of Catalan independence. Tens of thousands of people joined a counter-demonstration.
A group of independentists who were protesting against the use of rubber bullets by the police have started to paint the walls of the streets with black paint, which has led to the appearance of dark clouds of black paint on the streets normally used by tourists.
Later the same day, the police are going to produce tear gas in order to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, independentist groups chanted "No oblidem, no perdonem" (Don't forget, don't forgive) while unionist groups chanted "Llarga vida a Espanya" (Long live Spain).
Fourteen people have been arrested for throwing Molotov cocktails during the protests, according to local reports.
The tensions have not decreased in this region of mental attitude independentist one year after the October 1st referendum considered illegal by Madrid but also dut to be carried out by the Catalan separatists.
The voters will be able to vote for independence in a referendum with a large majority, even though the index of participation is likely to be low, until then the opponents of secession will boycott the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, at least 1000 people will be injured this year after the police attempt to break up the Catalan regional elections.
The independentist groups will camp out all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration will take place at the same time, but the demonstrators will be forced to take a different route.
Narcís Termes, 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the pro-independence demonstration with his wife, will say that he no longer has any hopes for the possibility of Catalonia's independence.
“Last year was one of the best moments.”
I have seen my friends crying with joy at the prospect of being able to vote, but now we're stuck.
Despite winning a narrow victory in the December 21, 2012 Catalan independence referendum, the pro-independence parties have suffered a setback this year, with many of their leaders in exile or in jail awaiting trial.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support for the police with his mobile phone, and says that the conflict has re-energized the politicians of both parties.
“The tension doesn't get any less,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new Catalan business leaders before the courts last year, is going to announce that he will participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Presenting oneself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the retrograde steps in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he says.
Londonderry: Homes for sale with a garage
Three homes of 33, 34 and 39 years have been repeatedly attacked by a gang in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent at 7:30 p.m. local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said they would cause damage to the doors and the same buildings.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone has fired a ballista at the castle.
Menga's goal gave the Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston is going to be the winner
The Livingston, who last year had been promoted to the Scottish Premier League, will surprise the Glasgow Rangers with their second defeat in 18 games under new manager Steven Gerrard.
Dolly Menga's goal is going to make the difference, as this victory puts Gary Holt's team in second place, sharing the position with the Hibernian.
The Gerrards, in change, will continue to play outside of home in the Premier League this season. On Sunday they will face the leader, Hearts, with a difference of eight points.
However, before that, the Rangers beat the Rapid of Vienna to qualify for the Europa League.
The Livingston, on the other hand, has expanded to six parts of the city, with a Holt as coach who faces defeat for the first time since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
The Livingston doesn't take advantage of its opportunities in front of the visiting team
Holt's team would have had to score before the Rangers' goal, as their direct play was causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson is going to open up space between the defense, but he's going to mess up when he finds himself in front of the goal. After that, Alan Lithgow is going to send the striker out to stretch in order to try to score the pass from Craig Halkett, which will create the goal.
The locals already know that the Rangers will be staying in their area, so they won't have any problems with the visitors during the games.
So that's how we're going to score this goal.
The referee will award a free kick against the interests of Rangers and Livingston will score an open goal, with Declan Gallagher and Robbie Menga combining to score the goal.
At the end of that moment, Rangers had dominated possession, but found themselves up against a defence that was impenetrable and a goalkeeper in Liam Kelly who had very little to do for the rest of the game.
The scene will repeat itself in the second half, with Alfredo Morelos forcing Kelly to make a save.
For his band, the Rangers' Allan McGregor is expected to play with Scott Pittman and Lithgow is expected to score another goal against Livingston.
The Rangers are going to dedicate themselves to training a goalkeeper and another player in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, they are going to claim two penalties, one for a supposed entry of Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other for a foul.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A great performance and a great result for Livingston.
A man thinks they are going to be excellent, and they have exceeded all expectations on this trajectory.
His style of play and his personal qualities have not changed since his return to the top flight, but much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team from the moment he arrived.
There's going to be a good team of heroes.
The captain Halkett is going to be immense, with a perfectly organized defense, while Joe Worrall and Connor Goldson are going to be dependent on Menga throughout the whole game.
Even though the Rangers have lost a lot of inspiration, they still have a lot to offer.
All the brilliant moments with Gerrard as a manager have not been able to maintain the level.
They don't know how to create chances (only one of them managed to get past the local defense), and the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, would do well to take a warning.
Disagreeable reception for Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) the leaders of Turkey and Germany are going to have breakfast together in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to Germany, with the aim of repairing the relations between the two NATO allies.
These have deteriorated as a result of human rights abuses, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan, on the other hand, will be moving to Cologne to inaugurate a new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey in the world.
The police are going to be on high alert to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, if there is a large number of followers.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Istanbul and other Turkish cities, many of them Kurds, to condemn both Erdogan and the German government's decision to welcome him.
The two demonstrations reflect the division of opinion about the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and a dictator by others.
Accident in Deptford: a cyclist was killed when he collided with a car
A cyclist was killed as a result of a collision with a lorry in London.
The accident happened close to the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, an area with a lot of traffic from Deptford, south-east of the city, at 10:15 local time.
The driver of the vehicle is going to be prosecuted and the paramedics are going to attend to the cyclist, who is going to die in the act.
The accident occurred some months after another cyclist was killed in a collision with a car on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the site of Saturday's accident.
The metropolitan police have said that their agents are working to identify the man and inform his family of the events.
The road has been built and traffic diversions have been put in place for buses. In addition, it has been advised to bus drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six agents injured in an altercation
Security agents at the prison have been injured in an altercation with inmates of high security, according to the office of the prison.
The executions will be carried out at HMP Long Lartin, Worcestershire, at 09:30 BST on Sunday, and will continue for as long as it takes.
Agents "tornado" specially trained to move quickly to the scene of the crime in order to apprehend the fugitive, in the case of which seven inmates have been implicated.
The agents have to be shot in the face at close range in order to kill them.
According to a portaveu of the prison service: "We have deployed specially trained staff to deal with the incident at Long Martin prison, which is still ongoing."
They have had to be killed with ferrets.
We will not tolerate violence against our citizens. It is clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to answer for their actions to the police and may have to spend more time in jail.
At Long Lartin prison there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
The month of June, we will know that the captain of the prison will have been transferred to a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October of last year, the agents of the Anti-Avalanche Unit were present at the prison to resolve a serious altercation in which prison staff were attacked with pool cues.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with heavy rains (areas with drought could benefit)
It is not common for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that is exactly what is expected to happen at the beginning of the second half of the week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for parts of Arizona for Monday and Tuesday, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that the Rosa will arrive directly to Phoenix on Monday and take possession of the city on Tuesday night.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix will comment on the fact that only two tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) is going to be 64 km from the border with Arizona.
The most recent models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 50 and 100 mm of rain for the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the desert in the south-west, such as the Rocalloses centrales and the Gran Conca, could register between 25 and 50 mm, with the possibility of up to 100 mm in isolated areas.
For areas that are not at risk of river flooding, the Rosa flood could be a good news story, as long as the region does not suffer a severe drought.
Even though floods are a major concern, some of the precipitations could be beneficial, as the south-west of the country is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of the state of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will hit the peninsula of Baja California, in Mexico.
The Rose continued to have strength on Wednesday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and was located about 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm has been getting colder and colder in the Pacific, which is why it is losing strength.
For now, it is expected that the storm will make landfall in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm or hurricane by late Monday or early Tuesday.
Precipitations in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of flash floods.
According to weather.com, "75 to 150 mm totals are expected from Baja California to the north-east of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north to Mexico with a force of tropical storm, before arriving at the border with Arizona at first light on Tuesday morning with a force of tropical depression, before finally reaching the state of Arizona and arriving in the early hours of Tuesday morning.
The main risk we expect from the Rosa or the one that remains is strong precipitations in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the desert of the south-west of the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that the plugs will cause dangerous flash floods in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four people for the purpose of murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with serious stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found with serious injuries in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at 4:00pm on Saturday, local time.
He will be transferred to the hospital, where he is found to be "stable."
Two 17-year-olds, one 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested in the area of Radstock, according to the police in Avon and Somerset.
The agents have made a call for anyone who may have witnessed any of the events with their mobile phones to come forward.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for the party’s despicable tactics and disgusting treatment of witnesses,” Trump declared in an election-eve rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump is going to say that Kavanaugh has "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his confirmation process.
Kavanaugh is expected to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford is also expected to testify in relation to his affidavit.
The president is going to say on Saturday that "the American people are going to see the genius, the quality of humanity and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a jurist with an admirable career of public service,” he said to the crowd of supporters in Virginia’s Western District.
The president indirectly referred to the Kavanaugh nomination while speaking about the importance of Republican voter participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important elections of our lives.”
I didn't run, but in reality I did.
"For that I've been fighting for the whole of my life."
Trump will argue that the Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing."
It is expected that the first vote on Kavanaugh's nomination will take place in the Senate on Friday, according to an aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Hundreds of thousands of deaths due to the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, and many more have been injured by the landslides that swept across the beaches, caused by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday.
Hundreds of thousands of people had gathered on the beach in Palu on Friday to celebrate a festival when a tsunami of up to six metres high hit the coast, killing many people and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami will be followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When the threat of a tsunami was imminent, the people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately. For that reason, they became victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency in Jakarta.
“The tsunami is not going to come all at once, it will sweep away trees, trunks, houses, it will destroy everything that is on the ground,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved at speeds of up to 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
There are people who have been able to survive the tsunami by hiding in a tree, he says.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 different shelters in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency show the extent of the damage to buildings and bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas will continue to be built in this coastal city.
The series of tremors will be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) says that the energy released by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima will be equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT.
According to the agency, the characteristics of the city's geography, located at the end of a long and narrow valley, could have increased the magnitude of the tsunami exponentially.
Nugroho will describe the damage as "considerable" and will say that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels are going to be destroyed.
Some of the bodies of some of the victims, he says, will be found trapped between the ruins of the buildings that collapsed, adding that 540 people will be injured and 29 will be missing.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the injured could increase by 300 km to the north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications will be completely paralyzed and we will not be able to receive any information from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people there,” said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers have been heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which could turn out much worse," he says.
The agency is going to be heavily criticized on Saturday for not warning of the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, even though the agents are saying that the waves are going to arrive in the next few hours.
In a recording of a fan shared on social networks, it is possible to hear a man located on the top floor of a building desperately trying to warn the people on the street about the tsunami that is about to hit.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water crashes into the shore, sweeping away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters will not be able to authenticate the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a general shutdown of the Ministry of Electricity which has made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Despite the fact that the military has begun to send humanitarian aid by air from Jakarta and other cities, the evacuees are still in desperate need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for emergency flights and will be closed again by the end of October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is estimated to be over 800.
The situation is very difficult.
Despite the fact that World Vision aid workers were able to reach Donggala without any problems, they have been unable to reach the city of Palu, where they are staying in tents set up at the side of their office, and have had to witness scenes of total destruction.
He said, "We will see a lot of destroyed houses."
It's a catastrophe.
As well as the groups of aid workers, some people are complaining that they are being prevented from carrying out humanitarian work in Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, the collection of water, provisions, and the deployment of foreign personnel can only begin once a disaster has been declared a national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, the head of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“A cop who the government says ‘it’s a national disaster’ can start to ask for international assistance, but it hasn’t been declared at that level yet.”
As the second night after the earthquake and tsunami hit Palu, friends and relatives of the missing are holding on to the hope that their loved ones will be found alive.
On Saturday, they will rescue a boy trapped in a keyhole.
On Sunday, rescue teams were able to free a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with the cost of her house on the coast.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which will conclude at the end of this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people arrested at the Hotel Roa Roa, there were his students.
As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional baggage.
Mr. Gendon is going to explain that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the hotel Roa Roa between the paragliding community, he had sent desperate messages via WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
In addition, the messages appear with a gray verification mark on accounts with a double blue logo.
“I think that’s what they’re trying to say,” he added.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 from an automated teller machine at Newport on the Levee.
On Friday morning, a group of thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's armored car driver at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The agent Dennis McCarthy will indicate to the press that the driver of the vehicle was operating the automatic parking system at the entertainment complex and was preparing to distribute more meals.
While he was stuffing his pocket, another man "came out of nowhere" and robbed him of a bag of money destined for distribution.
According to the press release, the witnesses will be able to see various suspicious characters fleeing the scene, but the police will not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Any person who comes across information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper is changing his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change to Twitter, he wrote: "I've been formally known as Kanye West for a long time."
It's been a long time since the West has used the nickname "Ye", and he will use it as the title of his eighth album, which will be released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to present his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper will replace Ariana Grande, who is cancelling her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his artistic name, West has previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'Amen' is the most used word in the Bible, and 'Amen' means'so be it'," he said at the start of this year, while talking about the title of his latest album with the radio host Big Boy.
That's how you do it, that's how we do it.
The past few years have seen the rise of Kanye, who is simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good side, our bad side, our confused side, all.
The album is more of a reflection of what was going on at the time.»
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have adopted the name.
Sean Combs has been known by a variety of names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, West's former collaborator, has changed his name to Jay-Z in all capital letters.
The president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised not to use the military against civilians.
The president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised not to use the military against civilians, as long as the country is complex enough to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a brutal crackdown on students.
López Obrador will promise on Saturday at the Plaza de Tlatelolco that "the military will no longer be used to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people in an era when student movements were on the rise in Latin America.
López Obrador, who has pledged to give support to young Mexicans by providing monthly stipends to students and making more public universities free,
He has said that the lack of educational opportunities and the lack of opportunities for young people have made them vulnerable to criminal gangs.
The U.S. is doubling its funding for artificial intelligence research.
While China is becoming more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States would have to double the amount of money they spend on research in this field.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures in the field of artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. has a general lack of formal strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
On the other hand, the Xina is going to present its plan for the next year: its goal is to become the number one company in the world for artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as other countries are far behind the US in this area,” said Lee.
“Doubling the funding could double the opportunities that the U.S. is offering in artificial intelligence,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the founder and CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In 1980 he will work at the University of Carnegie Mellon on a system of artificial intelligence that will surpass the American player in the game of Othello with the best classification and, subsequently, will work at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese subsidiary of Google.
It will value positively technological competitions prior to the North American government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA), and it will ask where the next one will take place in order to identify the proper visionaries.
"Sometimes, the American researchers have to work for years to get public funding," Lee will say.
According to Lee, "It's not the Chinese who get angry with the academics; it's the businesses."
In the last few years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired thousands of university graduates to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
He's going to comment that the U.S.'s influence in the area of artificial intelligence could also be felt in the area of immigration policy.
I think we will have to offer automatic residence permits to PhD students in AI.
In July 2017, the Council of State of Xina will present its plan for the development of artificial intelligence.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) grants funds to Chinese institutions of higher education in the same way as the National Science Foundation of the United States (NSF), but the quality of the research is inferior to that of the United States.
At the beginning of the year, the Department of Defense of the United States is going to create a Center for Artificial Intelligence Conjunction, which will bring together researchers from industry and academic institutions, and the White House is going to announce the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has announced a $2 billion investment in a new initiative called AI Next.
According to the Foundation for Science and Technology, it currently spends more than $100 million a year on artificial intelligence research.
However, it has been more than a month since the White House announced its intention to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
The Macedonians are holding a referendum to decide on the name of their country
On Sunday, the Republic of Macedonia will hold a referendum on changing its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which has blocked the country's membership in the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, has claimed that the name of its northern province constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments are expected to reach an agreement on the new name, but the nationalists argue that the change would alter the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign is raising doubts about whether the minimum 50% participation threshold will be met.
The question on the referendum ballot is: "Are you in favor of joining NATO and the European Union, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Opponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that will be created as a result of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, organizations such as the EU and NATO.
Olivera Georgijevska, a 79-year-old from Skopje, said: "Today I have voted for the future of the country, because the young people of Macedonia want to live in freedom in the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life."
Notwithstanding the fact that it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will abide by the result of the vote.
In order to change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in the Parliament.
The Catalan Electoral Commission will inform us that no irregularities have been detected in the 13th hour.
However, the participation rate was only 16%, compared to the 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered voters took part.
Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old from Skopje, said: "I've come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe."
The first prime minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in favor of the referendum on changing the name of the country, which would open the way for the country to join the EU and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small scenario and putting up placards in front of the tents set up for the people who would boycott the referendum.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we do not want to join through the back door, we want to join through the front door.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept Macedonia, they can go to other countries, like China and Russia, and form part of the European integration.
The Prime Minister of North Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, has said that the country's accession to NATO will be accompanied by investments more than necessary for Macedonia, which has a tax rate of more than 20%.
“I think that the majority of citizens will vote in favor, because more than 80% of citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said before depositing his petition.
Zaev is expected to say that a "yes" would mean "confirmation of our future".
According to an opinion poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies, between 30% and 43% of voters participated in the referendum, a shortfall below the minimum required.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian channel Telma TV, 57% of the respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
Of the 70%, 70% would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50% more than the number of votes cast.
If the referendum were to pass, it would be the first crack in the façade of the pro-Western government that has ruled the country since the end of the civil war.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, scores a goal after dribbling the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling scored the goals as Manchester City beat Brighton 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) on Saturday.
Agüero is going to score a goal in the 65th minute in a play that looks ridiculous.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentinian is going to break out of the camp.
We will be running at full speed between three defenders of Brighton, scoring with the one that came out onto the field of play.
After that, Agüero will be surrounded by four green samarretes.
We'll have to wait and see how many more goals we can score before we concede one at the other end of the pitch.
He's going to make a pass on Sterling's left.
The first touch of the ball will be in the area, in Agüero's area, to the right of the Brighton goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan, with a cross that is going to hit the inside of the post.
“Agüero has got a few niggles,” Pep Guardiola, the City manager, will tell the press.
We've decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's it.
We are lucky to have scored a goal at that moment.
But it will be Sterling who will give Manchester City the early advantage in the fight for the Premier League title.
His goal is going to arrive at the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero is going to break the pilot in depth at the Brighton and
He will make a beautiful pass to the left for Leroy Sane.
He will drive the car before handing it over to Sterling at the end of the race.
The striker of the Sky Blues will score the winning goal inside the network before leaving the pitch.
The City will face Hoffenheim on Tuesday in the group stage of the Champions League, at 18:55 h, at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, would like to get rid of the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-offs, there was no need to force an extra inning.
However, Scherzer, a very competitive pitcher, is hoping to come out of the bullpen on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who maintain a lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to play in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a comfortable 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still need to win the World Series to claim their first title.
Even if we don't get to play, at least we can get to know the environment here, in Denver, and know that the other team is probably going to play at a higher level than we have this year.
Why would you want to lose this game?»
The Nationals have yet to announce a reliever for Sunday, but it appears they are going to let Scherzer pitch if that's what he wants.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th opening day start, will throw a bullpen session on Wednesday and will start the game on Thursday, his usual day of rest.
The right-handed reliever from Washington has a record of 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump held a meeting in Virginia's West
The president was referring indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done so far has been in November.
Five weeks to go to one of the most important elections in our history.
This is one of the great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great
Trump is going to continue: "You're going to see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, they're passing right now."
They are determined to regain their power by any means necessary, even if it means their meanness, their bad intentions.
It doesn't matter to them who gets hurt, as long as they get the power and control. That's what they want: power and control. But they won't give it to you.
The mission of the Democrats is to "resist and obstruct."
“You can see it in the next four days,” he said, and he will call the Democrats “enutjats, mesquins, brutish and false.”
Trump is going to attack Dianne Feinstein, the most senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is likely to cause a strong backlash from the public.
Do you remember his response?
Do you want to filter the document?
Eh, eh, what?
No, no, no. Wait a moment... This is the most painful expression of body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
It is intolerant of those who think differently.
When the activists of my local party vote to censure me, it won't surprise you.
In the end, the last of a series of British parliamentarians have told us that we are not welcome here.
My colleague in the House of Commons, Joan Ryan, is going to introduce a similar treatment for anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I will be criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe. Irònicamente, these are the same questions that Jeremy disagreed with the leaders of the past.
In the notice of the meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party on Friday it was announced that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the majority of my eight years as a Labour councillor, the council's full council meetings were held on a Friday night.
Unfortunately, this is not the time for many meetings, and it has been a long time since the promise of "more generous and amiable" politicians has been forgotten.
It is becoming more and more evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate divergent opinions, and each opinion is judged in terms of whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This is going to happen very soon, as Jeremy Corbyn is going to become the leader of the Labour Party, as many of his colleagues have been expecting for some time now.
Every time I speak in public, I say what I say, the social networks fill up with aggressive messages asking why I am not renewing my candidacy, denouncing the politicians of the center and saying that there would not be a Labor Party.
This is not just for me.
Of course, I have more experience than some of my colleagues, since my missives are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and we won't stop.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this era is to see how normalized abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn will declare this week that the Labour Party will foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is not as diverse as it used to be, and with each motion of "no confidence" or each change in the rules, the party is becoming more conservative.
In the last two years there have been many councils and I have been recommended to keep my cap low, which is not as expressive and "tot aniria bé".
But I haven't gone into politics for that.
As soon as I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my student days, I was inspired by the government of Neil Kinnock, who was going to leave my class literally buried, I will try to defend public services better for those who most need them, either as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I haven't hidden my political views, nor have I done so in the last elections.
No-one in Nottingham East could doubt my political positions and the points of disagreement I have with the current leadership.
To those who are promoting the referendum on Thursday, I would say that in a moment in which the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our businesses and public services, it is not the time to waste time and energy on my leadership of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to send is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to all my Labour voters, whether they are members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that I will continue to do so, regardless of any threats to my re-election or any other political interests.
Chris Leslie is a member of the House of Commons for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr beat Melrose 38 - 17
Two last-minute attacks have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr will win this vibrant match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
The Ayr are the only undefeated team in the league.
In the end, the local team is going to have to thank their superior defensive play and the fact that they know how to take advantage of better opportunities, and the coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
“The games we’ve played so far have put us to the test and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m very happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, will say: "Well done to Ayr, they've made the most of the opportunities better than we have."
Grant Anderson's try at the 14-minute mark, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead, but Rory Hughes' try for the Warriors, converted by Jason Baggott, allowed Melrose to take the lead.
The weather is expected to improve for the second half of the match, with Ayr having a 17-5 lead at the break.
However, the Melrose will start in the second half and Patrick Anderson, converted to Baggot, will reduce the differences to five points.
After that, the game will be interrupted for a long period of time due to the serious injury that will be suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who will be taken off on a stretcher, and the Ayr will be able to widen the distance with Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Next, head coach Blair Macpherson is going to be warned with a yellow card and, once again, the Melrose are going to take advantage of the superiority of one of their players over Bruce Colvine.
Meanwhile, the local team will react and when Struan Hutchinson sees that Climo is without a pilot, he will score a goal from the penalty spot, MacPherson will score a goal from behind the Ayr keeper.
The weather is going to play a big part, as it has been doing for the past few days, after Kyle Rowe scored a try from a chip by David Armstrong and passed the ball to Gregor Henry to score the fifth try for the local team.
The star of the series Still Game seems to be on the verge of starting a new career in the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, one of the stars of the TV series Still Game, seems to be on the verge of moving into the hotel business, after it was discovered that he had been named director of a restaurant chain with a license.
The actor, who is 56 years old, plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred with Greg Hemphill, his comedy partner for many years.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has refused to comment on the matter, even though one of The Scottish Sun's reporters has claimed that Kiernan had intended to enter the "florent sector of the restaurant business" in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, without a coastline, waits for the court to re-open the route to the Pacific
The navy patrols the coast of La Paz.
Public buildings fly the flag of blue and white.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right."
Recovering it is a matter of urgency.
The Bolivian territory without a coastline, the record of a lost coast before Xile in a conflict over resources at the end of the 19th century is still vivid, as is the desire to return to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the most profound in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, I would say, a positive attitude towards the result,” says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the resolution of the TIJ on large screens in the country, with the hope that the Tribunal de La Haia will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of negotiations, Xile is obliged to negotiate an exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle for re-election this week, also has many hopes pinned on Tuesday's vote.
We are very close to reaching the Pacific Ocean.
Despite this, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia's favor and that, even if it does, things will not change.
The UN agency based in the Low Countries does not have the power to adjudicate territorial disputes and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The resolution of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, which is produced only six months after the presentation of the final submissions, indicates that the case "was not complicated", according to Paz Zárate, an expert on international law.
The Bolivian economy has experienced a retrograde in the last four years.
Bolivia's current administration has blocked the question of access to the sea, according to Zárate.
“The rhetoric of Morales has undermined any good will on the part of Xile,” he will suggest.
Bolivia and Xile will continue speaking for a while, but it will be very difficult to maintain conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not had ambassadors to each other since 1962.
The former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative to The Hague, will reject the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Xile" and "a unique opportunity to put an end to 139 years of disputes, with benefits for both sides", he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, who is one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the question of maritime borders as a political crossbow.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access to the Pacific Ocean.
"The resolution is an opportunity for us to move on from the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not be possible unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho has said that his country will not give up its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust the United States.
He is going to speak at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
The minister will urge the United States to keep its promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries' rivals.
Their statements arrive at a moment when it seems that the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is about to resume nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three months after the summit celebrated in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
It is said that it is a dream to think that the sanctions will continue and that the United States' objection to a declaration on the Korean War will force North Korea to back down.
Washington has doubts about accepting North Korea's declaration if Pyongyang does not make significant moves towards disarmament.
Both Kim and the president. Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is a widespread scepticism about the seriousness with which Pyongyang is taking the question of renouncing its nuclear arsenal, which it considers the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo has said he plans to visit Pyongyang in May to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The parades of fashion in Paris reveal the latest collection of large hats, from the Champs-Élysées to a main street near you.
If you want to increase the size of your collection of sunglasses or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you can find more.
Valentino and Thom Browne are presenting a collection of exaggeratedly large hats for their SS19 collection, which will be on display at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been hit by a barrage of complaints, and these designers have brought their surprising creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's piece is going to be an exaggerated barrette, decorated with a large wing, in the shape of a plume, which flooded the top of the models' heads.
In addition to other oversized accessories, there was a barret of briquettes and, finally, a pinya, but none of these were designed to keep the fire going.
Thom Browne is also going to present a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, in bright colors, look more like Hannibal Lecter than they do haute couture.
A creation was assembled of a complete set of submarines, with tubes and propellers, while another looked like a cone of ice cream.
And if you follow the trends in fashion, you're in style.
The observers of styles predict that the huge beards could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The "Bomba" is a barret of palla, a ball with a diameter of two peus, which has been carried by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The tag on the back of the shirt is so small that it's going to fall off the bars on the social networks and it's going to bring another great creation to the passarel: a beach ball for the beach, as big as the one he was wearing.
Jacquemus's "bossa de ràfia" dress, in a bright orange-red color, decorated with ràfia and finished with a white leather belt, will be the highlight of Jacquemus's Spring/Summer 2019 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion designer Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and wide-brimmed hats on the main streets this summer. The designer has had a great impact, it would be a shame if the demand for large hats was ignored.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools have continued their tradition of academic excellence in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by the growing individual and collective efforts in esports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible education for their students and their parents.
The independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, as well as for life as a citizen of the world.
In the field of education, it is possible to design and implement a personalized curriculum for each student.
Nelson Mandela is going to say: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you speak to him in his language, that goes to his heart."
If you speak to them in their own language, you'll arrive at their heart.
This is a very important record that cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relations and generate confidence with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the language exams, it can be seen that the languages lead the tables of classification with the highest qualifications at independent schools.
The 68% of students who study foreign languages are expected to obtain an A grade.
The data, collected from 74 schools in the SCIS, shows that 72% of students will obtain an A in Catalan, while 72% of students will obtain an A in Spanish, 69% of students will obtain an A in French, and 63% of students will obtain an A in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are giving support to foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will need without doubt in the future.
Currently, the languages, as a subject of choice, are maintained at the same level as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other places.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the Commission for Employment and Competences of the United Kingdom will reveal that of the reasons given by employers for not being able to fill vacancies, 17% is due to a lack of linguistic skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming more and more important for young people to prepare them for their future careers.
As soon as there are more opportunities for skilled labor that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career path that a person takes, if they have a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with this skill.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically makes a person multilingual.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% do not know how to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double digit percentage of speakers.
For this reason, it is important for today's children to learn foreign languages.
Knowing several languages, especially those of economically developed countries, will give children better opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland there is a great deal of diversity between the schools as to which languages are taught.
Some schools focus more on modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the future, such as Arabic or Japanese.
If your child is interested in learning a foreign language, you can choose between a series of independent schools, which have teachers specializing in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of their background.
In the global commercial environment of the time, it cannot be denied that the languages continue to have an important role to play in the future of the country, and this must be reflected in the education system.
After all, the modern languages are considered to be "real communicative competencies internationally."
The independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to Scottish young people.
You've got to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron James will make his debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, Luke Walton, has announced that James will play the first game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, they still need to determine how much time he will play.
“They will be more than 48,” Walton said at the official press conference of the Los Angeles Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a Los Angeles Lakers' reporter, is saying that James will probably play only a few minutes.
After this week's training sessions, James will be asked about his plans for the next six games of the Lakers' preseason schedule.
“I don’t need to play in the pre-season in this phase of my career to be ready,” he said.
Meeting of Trump in Virginia of the West, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicked off a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia last night.
It is the first of five meetings Trump has planned for this week, which will include visits to places that are sympathetic to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for his candidate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court is still pending, Trump is trying to secure support for his own election in November.
What time is Trump's speech in Virginia tonight and can we watch it online?
Donald Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. EDT on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The meeting of Trump in Virginia of the West can be seen live at the link provided below, through live video streaming on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will address the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing this week on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, who is expected to be tense because of the sexual assault allegations against him, while the vote to confirm him is on hold for at least a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
However, the main objective of this meeting is to help the Republicans who are facing difficult elections in November to get a boost.
The five meetings of the Trump campaign scheduled for this week are aimed at encouraging volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so important to the president's agenda that he will travel to so many states that we can't even keep track of them all, and we're going to have a season of campaigning that's unprecedented.
This meeting, scheduled for this evening at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, West Virginia, could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania.
This Saturday will be the second time Trump visits Virginia from the West, the state that gave him more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Virginia's West, who is trailing in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is coming to give him a boost,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Virginia’s College at Wise, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the North American team shows its ambition to keep alive the hopes of the individual matches on Sunday
After three lopsided sessions, the foursomes on Saturday probably will be the match that this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum effect is a sporting concept invented in which the players really believe, especially in this competition.
So, where do we find the positive dynamic?
They have an advantage of six points and a four-point lead, so I think we're in a little bit of a positive rat's nest here.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, say the wind is a little bit in their favor and they have many reasons to be motivated, in large part because of the state of form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will be playing together all day and both have three points.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is setting a great example.
The Catalan-language newspapers have been full of praise for the team's performance in the first leg of the quarter-final, when they came back from two goals down to draw 2-2.
They will celebrate the goal that they will score in the 15th minute with a goal similar to the one that indicates that they still believe that the American team is not out of the competition.
“You have to work as hard as you can and worry about your own team,” Spieth will say.
It's all that's left to these players.
18 holes for putting.
The only players with more birdies than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed star of the Ryder Cup.
The adorable but foreign European couple have four children and make no mistakes.
“Moliwood” will be the only pair that will not play a bogey on Saturday night, and will also avoid bogeys on Saturday night and Friday morning.
For this result and the way in which their energy seems to flow from and to the public, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to win a possible European victory while the sun is setting on Le Golf National.
It's preferable to use different fonts.
Despite this, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson finished quickly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, who will be playing with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two birdies will be needed for Spain and Sweden to get out of the hole they are in.
However, there is no one who can help him get out of the hole.
The fourballs and the foursomes are very interesting to watch because of the interactions between the teams, the countries that give and the countries that don't, and the way a strategy can change from one end to the other.
At the end of the day, Europe has played better than the U.S. and will go into the final day with an important advantage, but this foursomes session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to win that some, especially in the U.S., have questioned.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup with a final score of 10-6
Europe will go into the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after winning the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday by 10-6.
The inspirational duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari will have to pull out all the stops to achieve two victories against Tiger Woods in difficult conditions and leave their mark on Le Golf National for the first time.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who was hoping to retain the trophy he won two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated the American team in the morning fourballs and went on to win the series 3-1.
The U.S. has shown more resistance in the foursomes and will not be able to close the gap.
The team of Jim Furyk needed to get eight points out of the 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, while Molinari and McIlroy, known as "Molliwood" after a week of sensational play, are the only pair to have won four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After Woods and Patrick Reed's 5&4 win over Bryson DeChambeau and Tony Finau in the fourballs, they went on to beat Woods and DeChambeau 5&4 in the foursomes.
Woods, who had been doused in two parts on Saturday, showed flashes of brilliance, but has lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and consecutively.
Justin Rose, who will not be playing in the fourballs in the morning, will be playing with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and they will win 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who will be ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have all of its face in a pleasant and south-westerly direction on that day.
Jordan Spieth, three times the champion of the tournament, and Justin Thomas set a new reference point for Americans with two points.
With a determination to win, Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter beat Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2 and 1 in the fourballs and, later, Rory McIlroy and Poulter beat Rory McIlroy and Poulter 4 and 3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two matches.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has an individual player won four points in the singles matches, but the team of Furyk, the defending champion, only needs a draw to retain the title.
However, despite being the second best team for two days, it seems that a counter-attack on Wednesday is out of the question.
North Korea says it will not disarm "unilaterally" if the United States does not show signs of confidence
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs is expected to announce on Saturday that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations are intensifying the country's distrust of the United States and that, in such circumstances, the country will not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho will tell the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea has taken "important measures of goodwill" during the past year, including dismantling its nuclear test site and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons or technology.
“They’re not going to respond in consonance with the U.S.,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament.”
If the North Koreans are serious about denuclearization, they will have to show that they are willing to take steps in phases, and that they will be rewarded for each step they take.
It will refer to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a president in office of the United States and a leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim is expected to commit to working toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the pressure to relax sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea must first dismantle its nuclear program and increase its level of pressure before it can achieve its goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.
The perception that the sanctions will hurt us is a fantasy of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the sanctions are continuing to increase our distrust.
Trump is not going to refer to a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the leader of the United States is going to highlight at the beginning of next week.
In that location, the minister will highlight three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in in the last five months and will add: "If the party involved in the question of denuclearization is North Korea, the denuclearization of the peninsula of North Korea will not have arrived at this situation of stalemate."
On the other hand, the speech of Ri will be very different from the one he made last year, when he declared to the UN General Assembly that launching missiles at the territory of the United States was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump called Kim Jong-un "Rocket Man" in a suicide mission.
In the United States, President Donald Trump, who has threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, will praise Kim Jong Un's fashion sense for taking steps to denuclearize, but will say that he still has a long way to go.
On Wednesday, Trump is expected to say that there is no deadline for North Korea and that "it doesn't matter if it's two years, three years or six months."
China and Russia support North Korea's claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its measures.
The U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is expected to declare on Thursday at the United Nations Security Council that: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the DPRK is achieved."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to cut off the funding of its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo is going to be found outside the United Nations General Assembly and after that he will go to Pyongyang to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit is not expected to go very well.
He is expected to leave Pyongyang by the end of July, but North Korea has already accused him of making "unreasonable demands" of a "gangster."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has agreed to dismantle a missile testing site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "measures in consonance."
It is said that Kim Jong-un had communicated that he was looking for "measures in consonance" with Trump's promises to Singapore, in addition to actions aimed at the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to take a nap.
A new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep less, in an attempt to combat the culture of studying all night, encouraged by the caffeine.
An academic has observed that students at the university are often unaware of the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, is designing the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
It is going to inspire me to create a course after doing a research on the impact of the lack of sound on the learning process.
At the end of the day, one of them will go to bed and say: "Why did I have to go through all this, at the end of the day?"
It is said that no one has ever spoken so much about the importance of sound, something that will surprise you.
In the course, which is being taught for the first time this year, students are taught the basic concepts of good study habits and how they can improve their academic and sporting performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and director of the University's mental health services, will say that the University will decide to introduce the course after the end of the semester.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory, the students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, lamps and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light on athletic performance and the importance of maintaining a regular sleep schedule.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term deprivation of sound can increase the risk of attacks of epilepsy, brain damage, depression and cancer.
Below, a map of the campus with interactive icons allows the participants to think about their daily route.
We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as we have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on our health.
The culture of pride in staying awake all night is still very much alive, and it will continue to grow as technology and pressure continue to increase.
Making sure to enjoy a good quality of music for a long time would be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, and it would also help to avoid gaining weight, since the lack of music causes the brain to go into starvation mode and makes the students feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physics, will help Professor Czeisler to design the course, after having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond is going to comment that the course has opened the doors and inspired him to teach the course in the whole campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask students of post-graduate programs to carry out a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
The professor Czeisler is going to recommend to students that they take into account the fact that they should set an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga ends with the homes of Gerrard
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed Liverpool side to a 1-0 defeat at home to Livingston, which looks like another defeat on the horizon.
Rangers were looking to add to their first victory of the season, a 4-1 home win over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side inflicted their second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as manager, leaving them 8 points behind league leaders Hearts.
Menga is going to score the goal 10 minutes before the end of the first half, and it doesn't look like the Rangers, who are lacking inspiration, will be able to equal the score.
While the Rangers are at the top of the Scottish Premier League, Livingston are in third place, behind Hibernian on goal difference.
The Rangers could face more difficulties after the judge of the line Calum Spence will need medical attention for a wound caused by an object that apparently was thrown from the stands.
Gerrard will make eight changes from the team that beat Ayr in the Betfred Cup quarter-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, is going to start with the same eleven that drew with Hearts last week. Undoubtedly, he will feel satisfied with the way his team, well organized, will suffocate their rivals in every moment.
If the Rangers can dominate possession, Livingston will create more danger than when they have the ball.
Of course, they had to mark the two minutes of stoppage time, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman in front of Allan McGregor, but the Mexican forward was unable to make the most of the opportunity.
A goal-line clearance from Keaghan Jacobs is going to hit Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow only manages to deflect the ball wide.
The Rangers seemed to have more hope going into the third period.
Alfredo Morelos believed he would have had a penalty in the 15th minute, just like Steven Lawless, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's appeals.
The Rangers will only have to deal with two crosses in the first half, but the first cross of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, will not have any problems with the cross of Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi's 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that he deserves it only for his effort.
Now, the Rangers will not be able to handle the hard-working style of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield is not going to react when Declan Gallagher passes the ball to Scott Robinson, who will keep his cool to score a simple goal.
Gerrard is going to act as a substitute for Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The substitution will have an immediate impact, as the extreme will make a pass to Morelos, as well as Kelly, who is going to run the block.
Despite this, the Livingstons will continue to capture the attention of visitors playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes to each other.
Holt's band could have had a shot at the finals, but McGregor is going to maintain his focus on Jacobs before Lithgow strays too far from the corner.
The substitute for Rangers Glenn Middleton is going to ask for another penalty for a foul on Jacobs, but now Thomson is going to make the big saves.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
This is a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day on which the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger is going to develop a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that will finally give us access to the "Geiger counter".
The Geiger counter, which is a pillar of science, is also going to become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Home: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals."
When you put these earplugs on, you can hear the effects of the radioactivity emitted by the minerals.
Evans: "I'm sure it's fantastic!"
Hans Geiger is going to die in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears its name continues to be used.
A new vaccine against cancer could allow the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new vaccine against cancer could allow the immune system to "see" and eliminate cancerous cells.
The vaccine shows the immune system how to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
It is possible to "see" a common protein in many cancers and, subsequently, reinject them
A vaccine trial is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancerous cells, will see the cancer disappear in less than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, subsequently, to inject them back.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The protein HER2 "favors the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach has been used to train the patient's immune cells to recognize and attack cancerous cells.
Kanye West is now embroiled in a pro-Trump diatribe after wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat on Saturday Night Live.
It's not going to end well
Kanye West will be credited as a writer on Saturday Night Live after a chaotic appearance on the show in which he congratulated President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a red "Make America Great Again" hat, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
Whenever I talk to white people, they always say: How can you like Trump if he's racist?
Well, if you're worried about racism, you should know that it's been a problem in the United States for a long time.
The Saturday Night Live program will begin with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it is not going to happen, Chris Rock is going to try to get the disapproval of West on the social networks.
It is not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained that he will not be treated well by the public because of the hat he is wearing.
They're going to start evicting the squatters.
I don't think you're leaving with that hat on.
To be honest.
According to the Washington Examiner, I am in a "weaker position."
West is going to continue: "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he puts on the cape of Superman so they can't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to advance?"
Proveu d'estimar."
Their comments will provoke the ire of the public most of the time, and the members of the program's crew will seem to be embarrassed, according to Variety, which has a reporter who will explain to the public: "The studio is going to be completely destroyed."
Ariana Grande will be performing as a last-minute substitute for Mac Miller, the rapper who died a few days ago.
The public will be left perplexed by the interpretation of the song I Love it, sung by a bottle of Perrier water.
West is going to get the endorsement of the group's conservative leader Candace Turner, who will say: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR SHINING A LIGHT ON US."
However, the host of the debate, Karen Hunter, is going to say that West is "exactly who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful."
But I don't think it's fair to reward someone (buying their music or robbing or giving support to their "art") who adopts and defends an ideology that hurts my community.
It's free.
We will also be adding.
Before the show, the rapper is going to announce on Twitter that he has changed his name and that he is now known as "the one before Kanye West."
It's not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg changed his name from Snoop Dogg to Snoop Lion and the disappearance of the music legend Prince inspired him to change his name.
Accusation of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant shooting
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was shot dead in Belfast on Thursday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the accused will appear in front of the first instance court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor's office will review the charges.
Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, the bastard son of Ned Stark, in the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
Despite this, the actor, who is 31 years old, has denounced the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such papers give the impression that young people think they have to be strong in order to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Kit said that "something had gone badly wrong" and that he was questioning how to confront the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old "Game of Thrones" actress Rose Leslie, has admitted that she has the determination to face up to the problem.
“Personally, I don’t think we’ve got it right when it comes to masculinity,” he says.
"What have we learned from the men during their development in relation to the problem they are facing?"
According to Kit, television can be held responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its characters who are so virile.
We will add: "What is innate and what is acquired?"
What is it about television and careers that makes young men feel they have to have this aspect of virility?
It is one of the great questions of our time: how will we feed ourselves?
Because I'm sure something has gone wrong with the young people.
In the interview, he also admits that he wouldn't do a prequel or sequel to the show when the final episode is scheduled for the summer, but that he is tired of battles and horses.
From November, Kit will star in a revival of the play True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his wife Rose has been the best thing that has ever happened to him.
I'm going to meet my future wife on the show, so I can give her my future family and my future life.
Ygritte, the love interest of Kit Harington's character, Jon Snow, on the Emmy-winning fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The wedding will take place in June 2018 at Leslie's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
The Xina has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected by the disease in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 will we be able to declare 40,000 cases.
The vast majority of cases are due to sexual transmission, unlike what used to be the case.
Traditionally, HIV has been spreading rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
Despite this, the number of people infected with HIV due to this cause has dropped to zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of the HIV virus through sexual intercourse is a major problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is still common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, the studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of those who maintain homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of sexually transmitted diseases are due to a lack of adequate precautions in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS as part of an effort to confront the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked information to senators from the Republican Party and dismissed "dangerous theories" and "conspiracy theories."
The representative of the United States, Maxine Waters, is going to denounce on Saturday the accusations according to which a member of her personal staff had published personal information about three Republican senators from the United States on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles is going to claim that the criticism and web sites of the extreme right are responsible.
“Think, think, and think some more,” Waters will say in a statement to Twitter.
Supposedly, the information published contained the addresses and phone numbers of the senators from South Carolina Lindsey Graham and Utah Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information will appear online on Thursday and will be published in the Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing on sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information is going to leak after three senators question Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState are reporting that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with the office of Waters and that it revealed the information of a member of Waters' staff.
“This allegation is completely false and a complete lie,” Waters will continue.
The member of my personal, the identity, the personal data and the security of the quality that have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent denunciations, will not be responsible in any way for this information leak.
This allegation is completely false and is nothing more than a fabrication.
Waters's statement is likely to generate criticism, including from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
This denial is full of indignation, writes Fleischer.
It makes me think that he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of doing something they haven't done, they shouldn't get angry.
Do not show defiance.
You don't have to question the motives of the accuser.
He must keep calm and carry on.
Fleischer seemed to be comparing the reaction of Waters to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who the Democrats are accusing of seeming angry during yesterday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running against Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
It's important to be sure.
In his statement, Waters is expected to say that his office had alerted the authorities and security forces of these fraudulent declarations.
They will ensure that the criminals are revealed, and they will continue, "and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions they have committed, and for all the damage they have caused, and for all the members of my personal staff."
Critique of Johnny English Strikes Again: parody of a limited spy by Rowan Atkinson
It is a tradition to refer to the Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this re-release of the Johnny English franchise is no exception.
Is this a new opportunity to export the country's sense of humor?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English has been able to renew his license to kill for a second time. His name indicates more than that he is a comic creation designed for a territory that speaks English.
Obviously, it's the bumbling secret agent who, despite his rare pretensions to glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a touch of this pair that adds a single note to the theme of Cars at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the international hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and the mysterious Barclaycard television commercials, where chaos was being sown.
There is one good moment in this last trip of mine.
I loved the Johnny English who would land on a helicopter wearing a medieval suit of armour and the rotor blades would hit him in the face.
What Atkinson does for physical comedy, but the humor seems to be quite fluid and strange, especially since serious films such as James Bond and Mission: Impossible have already included it.
Humor seems to be aimed at children more than adults and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English aren't as funny as the gags of Mr. Bean, who represents Atkinson.
The premise of the show is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A pirate informatic has infiltrated the secret network of British spies and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the territory, which causes consternation for the agent in charge, a paper lamentably small for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last time for a prime minister to be a pretentious and self-aggrandizing figure, who has already suffered a total collapse of popularity in political terms: Emma Thompson gives the best performance of her career as Theresa-May, but the script doesn't go any further.
His intelligence officers inform him that, as each spy acts in peril, there will be no retirement for any of them.
This includes the bumbling Johnny English, who is employed as a professor at some luxury institution, but also teaches classes on how to be a secret agent, with some good gags, but when English offers an academy of espionage that seems like a rock school.
English has returned rapidly to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his deputy prime minister, Ben Miller.
Ara Bough is a homebody, married to the commanding officer of a submarine, a paper enthusiast, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little underappreciated.
So, when Batman and Robin are called into action, they find themselves in the service of His Majesty the King, where they meet Olga Kurylenko, the spectacular "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
On the other hand, the prime minister is under serious threat from the charismatic billionaire technologist who claims he can solve the IT problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous misadventures: dressing up as waiters, setting fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos on board the luxury yacht of Volta, and English attempts to use a virtual reality device to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the parades have certainly come from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and naivety that it presents, it all seems like a children's program.
Things that are quite normal.
With the other Johnny English films, it's been helpful to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is planning to introduce a four-day working week and five-day weekend for British workers
The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical plan according to which Britons will work four days a week and get paid for five.
Supposedly, the party that wins the elections will be able to give the workers a day off thanks to the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI).
The employees get a week's vacation, but they still have to work the same amount of hours.
According to the sources, the idea would fit in with the economic agenda of the party and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The change to a four-day working week is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a method to allow workers to benefit from the economic change.
An experienced member of the Labour Party has told The Sunday Times: "It is expected that there will be a review of the policy before the end of the year."
It will not be the night of the day, but a week of four days is an aspiration that fits into the perspective of the party to balance the economy in favor of the worker and in the general industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party would not be the first to give its support to the idea, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week during the general elections in 2017.
Despite this, the Labour Party does not currently support this aspiration.
According to a spokesman for the Labour Party: "A week's work is not political and the party is not political."
The shadow chancellor of the exchequer, John McDonnell, will use the party conference next week to set out the party's vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell is going to show his determination to restore the power of the anonymous directors and the speculators in public services.
The plans of the minister also include that the shareholders of the water companies could not recover all of their investment, since the Labour government could apply "deductions" for the crimes that were committed.
He has also confirmed plans to transfer workers to the companies and create a fund to buy 10% of the shares of private companies in the sector for the employees, who expect to receive annual dividends of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change his opinion.
The FBI investigation of the sexual assault allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley is going to ask Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I'm being serious."
At the session I told the judge that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I've been trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my life, and I've been asking myself if I've done enough.
He was determined, resolute and sure of himself.
However, Graham's vote seems to carry a lot of weight.
“I have my own opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would present a very explosive accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett Kavanaugh is going to deny it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
At the end of the day, no one will be able to verify these people.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see that changing any time soon."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? How has it helped to reduce poverty?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday, an annual music festival featuring an impressive lineup of stars, with a mission just as impressive: to eradicate poverty around the world.
In the 2019 edition, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, as well as to raise awareness of the global goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which will begin in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international activists working to end global poverty.
For free entry to the event (if anyone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), participants have to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a prank phone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
How many years do you think it will take for Global Citizen to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way of persuading them to take part in an action or simply to sign a petition.
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who have helped to achieve various objectives.
Declares that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.2 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group will have achieved 390 commitments and announcements, of which 10,000 million USD have already been captured or recaptured.
The group estimates that the protected areas have a direct impact on more than 649 million people around the world.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and philanthropists based in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "helping children to grow as well as possible" and has promised to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in the history books.
The group will also explain that after more than 5,000 actions asking the UK government to improve the nutrition of horses and foals, the government will announce the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 500,000 people and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F questions on their website that asked "what do you think will happen if they end up with extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes we will fall, but we will get up again."
However, with the great movements for the defense of civil rights and against apartheid, they triumphed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will be performing at the event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blockade" to obstruct Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
According to the Washington Examiner, "If it's necessary, we'll have to go to the Navy to stop Russian energy from reaching the markets, including those in the Middle East, according to Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinke has denounced Russia's intervention in Syria, primarily, as an invitation from the legitimate government, which is a pretext to explore our energy markets.
“I think the reason why they are in the East is because they want to negotiate with the energy, just like they are doing in the East of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means of dealing with this question.
The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block them, to prevent the sale of its energy.
Zinke was addressing the audience at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group that describes itself as the "voice of the consumer of energy" in the United States.
Compare Washington's strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and you'll see that they're basically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is to exploit and substitute fossil fuels,” he said, while noting that Russia only has a reserve, since its economy is still dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, in place of Russian gas, the most economically viable option for European consumers.
With this in mind, the officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted repeatedly that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110,000 million cubic meters, is purely economic.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of its incompetence.
We share the opinion that energy cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution and that consumers need to be able to choose their suppliers.
The stance of the United States has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industry association in Germany, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the United States to separate its energy policy from that of the EU and the bilateral energy agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy policy,” Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren has said that she will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is expected to announce her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections in November.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren will confirm that she will consider running for president.
“It’s time for the women to take over Washington and fix the fracture in the government,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After the 6th of November, I will take my candidacy for president very seriously.”
Warren is going to intervene during the municipal meeting and is going to say that "President Trump is leading the country in the wrong direction."
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been very frank in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Thursday, Warren will say: "It's clear that the FBI investigation was underway before the election."
A new poll shows that a majority of Warren's voters think she won't run for president in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of likely voters in Massachusetts say they would not vote for Elizabeth Warren if she were to run for president.
Thirty-two percent support the candidacy.
The poll will reveal a wider support for the candidacy of former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor and 48 percent against.
Other possible Democratic candidates include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden is expected to announce his decision officially as soon as this week, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites her son Track Palin, who was affected by TEPT, at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) will spend a year in Iraq after enlisting in the Army on September 11, 2007
On Monday night they will be arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“With the one who is going to become my son when he returns, I can understand other families who are going through the ramifications of TEPT and some of the emotional scars that come back when our soldiers return,” he will explain to the public at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin is going to call the arrest "the elephant in the room" and is going to say the following to his son and other veterans of war: "make it a little different, make it a little tougher, ask yourself if you have respect for what your fellow soldiers and pilots have done and given to the country."
The suspect was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and is being held on charges of domestic violence and weapons possession under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, chief of the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a new policy on asylum
Several states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who flee domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia are expected to file an amicus curiae brief on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the Trump administration's "Remain in Mexico" policy.
The full name of the lawsuit filed by Grace vs Sessions that the United States for Civil Liberties is going to present in August against the federal government's policy has not been revealed.
It is said that the man's wife and children were attacked by the members of the violent band, but the American officials denied his request for asylum on the 20th of July.
They will have to go to Texas.
The advocates of the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there is a great number of applicants for asylum in the United States, as countries that are facing general problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States revoked a decision of 2014 of the Board of Appeals of Immigration, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia's attorney general, Karl Racine, is expected to declare on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
Federal law requires that asylum claims be adjudicated on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition infringes on this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
Lawyers are also arguing that the policy that denies entry to immigrants is bad for the economy of the United States, since it is more likely that successful entrepreneurs and "job creators" will move to the United States.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is expected to order immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
“The asylum is available for those who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, national origin, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” Sessions said in his announcement on June 11, 2018.
The asylum has a lot of problems, not just the most serious ones, but also the most common ones that people have to face every day.
Desperate efforts to rescue survivors in Palu as the death toll rises in a race against time to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is getting more desperate by the minute.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of two, said the air was "very tense" as she waited for her son to recover from a fever at the evacuation center in the city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance carries someone to the hospital.
There is a shortage of drinkable water.
Residents have been seen returning to their flooded homes to salvage what they can.
There are hundreds of thousands of refugees, and the hospitals, which are already over-crowded, are saturated.
Some of the victims, including Dwi Haris, who broke his leg, have been discharged from the military hospital in Palu, as the patients are being discharged due to the strong aftershocks that continue to occur.
The police refused to allow the family to enter the hotel room where the five-year-old girl and her mother were found dead.
“There was no time to save us.”
He was trapped in the ruins of the house, he explained to Associated Press, and he added that his family had witnessed a wedding in the village.
“I felt my wife asking for help crying, and after that I didn't feel her anymore.”
I don't know what's happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're doing well.
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses the Chinese government of "propaganda announcements."
A week later, a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper touting the advantages of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using U.S. newspapers to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump is scheduled to address the Des Moines Register on Wednesday after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. midterm elections.
The accusation by Trump that Beijing was meddling in the US elections will mark a new phase in Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
It is normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements for their countries in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and that has put pressure on the trade agreements between the two countries.
The tariffs imposed by the United States on China at the beginning of the trade war had the objective of punishing the exporters of states, such as Iowa, that supported the Republican Party of Donald Trump, according to experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former governor of Iowa, said that Beijing had harmed American farmers, ranchers and businesses.
China, Branstad is going to write an article for The Des Moines Register on Sunday: "They are redoubling their efforts to place propaganda ads in our free newspaper."
In order to disseminate their propaganda, the government uses the esteemed tradition of freedom of the press and the free press in the United States to insert an advertisement for payment in The Des Moines Register.
In Beijing, where I live, you won't find many people who agree with each other, and you won't see any reflection of the opinions of the Chinese citizens on the trajectory of China's economic development.
One of the most prominent newspapers in China declined to publish the article, but did not name the publication.
Republicans are the voters of women before the midterm elections with the disaster of Kavanaugh, warn the analysts
Many of the leading Republicans have come out in support of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing multiple allegations of sexual assault, and analysts are predicting a negative response, especially among women, in the midterm elections.
The emotions that surround this case are extremely high and the majority of Republicans have already made it clear that they want to move forward with a vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article that will be published Saturday.
Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will say that he doubts that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened today, or tomorrow, or next month,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the principal deputy press secretary and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday, November 2nd, the Protestants shout "November is coming!" (November is coming!) while demonstrating in front of the Senate while the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decide to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of the Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be absent from the graphic, explains Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
The people say that they have been here before; it's true.
But they could have been more, especially among women voters and younger voters, who often don't vote because they don't like the president.
After Ford's public testimony, more details emerged about her allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh. Analysts suggested that the Republicans could get a negative response if they pushed too hard.
“This has become an embolic for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the Senate or the final vote. It’s also about how the Republicans have managed this issue and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC that helps elect Democrats.
On the other hand, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's testimony and those who believe Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony to be "indubitably true" or "probably true", while 35% believe Kavanaugh's testimony to be "indubitably true" or "probably true".
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had lied under oath during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations against Ford and, at the very least, another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford will testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee next week under oath that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when they were both 17 years old.
Ramirez alleges that the candidate for the Supreme Court will show his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the open-source platform of code of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to categorize their data and share it with a limited number of people.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the real intention of Inrupt was to "dominate the world."
“We have to do it now,” says the emerging company.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform to allow users to create their own "personal data space" or a POD.
It can contain lists of contacts, lists of tasks pending, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional information.
It's with Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a web browser right now.
What is exclusive to the personal data area is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's chief operating officer, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills so that Solid can be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a platform for security acquired by IBM, some in-house developers contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, developers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the ones available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee will say that none of his team is talking about "Facebook and Google" about whether to introduce a radical change to all their business models during the night.
They're not asking for permission.
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last two months, Berners-Lee has been a prominent voice in the debate over the neutrality of the Internet.
After the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Foundation for the World Wide Web and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee says he is "incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web."
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Creu Victòria de la I GM
The only cleric of the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War was posthumously honoured by his home town 100 years after his death.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Despite this, he will be shot down four days later and will not know that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
The pair will unveil a commemorative plaque on Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his sons, Michael Vann, said that it was "magnificent" that the diamond was presented exactly 100 years after the discovery of the mine.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns."
Later, he will sprint to the line and, with the "maximum courage", he will push the line ahead of him before launching himself over a hurdle with a single bound.
The colonel will be shot by a German machine gun on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) will say that the actions of his son and daughter-in-law are a project that could never be equaled, which produces a feeling of humility.
He and his son, Dr. James Vann, will also leave a wreath at the end of the parade, directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann is going to say that he is very honored to be part of the parade and will add that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he receives from many people.
The MMA fans who are going to stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 will be able to watch Peppa Pig in its original language.
Imagine waking up in the middle of the night to watch Bellator 206 and not being able to watch the most important event.
The billboard for San Jose contained 13 lights, six of which were on the main target and were to be seen all night on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing for the fight, the spectators of the United Kingdom will be left stunned when the programming will change to Peppa Pig.
Some of them were disgusted by having to stay up all night to see the fight.
A Twitter follower is going to describe the changes in the drawings as "a wave of vomiting".
According to Dave Schwartz, vice-president of marketing and communications at Bellator, they will be changing the programming at 6:00 a.m.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, is going to say that they are going to include the British audience in the programming in the future.
"When I think about repetition, I think it can work," says Coker.
But they are only open from 8am to 2pm on Saturday and Sunday, and not at all on Monday.
But we are working on it.
When I changed the channel, there were a lot of missed messages, and not all of them were pleasant.
We're trying to resolve it, we think it's a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
They'll leave five lights on, instead of six normally. They're going to try to make it show up for the spectators, but it's going to end.
It's a very unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt "inferior" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he has always felt inferior to the rest of the world because of his sexual orientation, but that it will provide him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete has declared that he will not give up until he graduates from secondary school, which he did not.
The Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, was about the rights of gay people to give hope to other people.
He will also say that it is important to preserve the Olympic Games.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has been on sick leave for several months due to ill health.
Daley, who will appear on the first episode of Laverne & Shirley, will say that he felt "less than" the others because "it wasn't acceptable socially for boys and girls to play together."
Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph.
He wanted to prove that there was "something" there, that he wasn't gay after all.
The two-time bronze medalist of the Olympic Games has become a prominent promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image to campaign for the Commonwealth Games to be held in more countries that decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without having to hide his sexuality and that he wanted to give hope to other people.
The triathlon of the world is going to explain that he had fallen in love with a man, the American director Dustin Lance Black, who is going to meet him in 2013, "he is going to grab him by surprise".
Last year, Daley is going to marry the Oscar-winning actress who is 20 feet taller than him, but he says that the difference in age has never been a problem.
According to him, when you're young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple will be married in June of this year by a judge named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "his whole perspective" has changed.
If I had been asked last year, all I would have needed was to win an Olympic gold medal.
There are some things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is called Robbie.
His son is said to be just like his father, Robert, who is going to die in 2011 at the age of 40 from a brain tumor.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked for was if he had the tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him "no, you won't be sitting in the first row", I'd say.
"While I was holding him, he stopped breathing and I knew he was dead, that's when I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible."
The following year, Daley will compete in the 2012 Summer Olympics and is expected to win the bronze.
"I knew that was what I had been waiting for all my life: to jump in front of a huge crowd at home in the Olympics. There is no better feeling," he will say.
It will also inspire the third song (Proud) of Heather Small, which had accompanied the preparations for the Olympic Games and which still gives her goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is going to play in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will try to break a record by playing in his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he'll have to change his physical state if he wants to avoid being a "lucky loser."
Mickelson, who will be playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, will be introduced by captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
In place of being the center of the action, as has been the case in the United States, the emcee of the five major tournaments shares his time between being an emcee and working on his game at the camp, with the hope of rectifying what he sees as going wrong.
There have been no more direct drivers, nor as many as at the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough punishes the wayward shots.
Mickelson's own trajectory is not particularly exciting, but he will face the precise course of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the first four matches of this week.
If the Americans, four points ahead at the start of the 12 individual matches, get off to a strong start, Mickelson's match could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk has expressed confidence in this course, without being able to tell us much more.
“You’ll understand your role perfectly on that day,” Furyk said. “You’ll be standing on the edge of the green and you’ll be ready to hit the ball.”
You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
It is a hall of fame and it has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
Probably, I didn't think I'd be playing two games.
I've imagined it more, but I've also imagined it less and that's how we're going to move forward.
It's going to be here, just like any other.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It can mean the end of a player's career at the Ryder Cup, which has never equaled his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 times, lost 20 times and drawn 7 times, all of which Furyk has said has brought intangible benefits to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, humorous, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great company for the team," he explained.
I think that the younger players are also having fun this week, which has been great to see.
It adds a lot to the game.
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can be exploited
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn out to be a tough day.
The Danes will begin the year 1997 at Valderrama, when Seve Ballesteros's team had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they would win by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
“We had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, we were going to lose, but at Valderrama, we were going to win, but at Valderrama, we were going to win,” he said, looking at the image, after seeing the victory of the team of 2018 by 5-3 on Friday as well as on Saturday, which leaves the score at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The history has taught me and the rest of the team that it is not over until it is over.
Now we have to go all the way.
You have to get out and do it.
This doesn't end until the points can't be scored.
We have a goal, to win the trophy, and we have to keep our concentration to do it.
I've already said it, in the center of the 12 players that we have, but I also have present those who are our rivals: the best players in the world.
Impressed by the quality of his players' performance on the golf course, Bjorn has said: "I won't rush into it."
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual contribution will make the difference and it will all change.
It's fantastic to be there with a company, but the individual duels put your skills to the test to the maximum.
This is the message you must deliver to the players, choose the best one for tomorrow.
In this moment, leave your company and he will also leave and the best of him will also leave.
In opposition to Bjorn, the captain's rival, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will add three points to the total.
Furyk knows all there is to know about the last day's play, as he will be part of the winning U.S. team at Brookline before losing in the "Miracle at Medinah" that will win Europe.
“I remember all the words,” said Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, before the last day.
Today we have 12 important matches, but we want to start with a good one, at Brookline and Medinah.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure on these central defenders.
We have prepared the lineup in accordance with the circumstances and in order to make the best use of our resources.
Thomas has the reputation of trying to start a comeback against Rory McIlroy in the first round, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the European players in the first match of the day.
Bjorn believes that this order is necessary because it covers all the possibilities.
The new warship of Germany, postponed again
The new German frigate is expected to be completed by the end of 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War, but it won't happen, at the very least, until next year.
The finalization of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main vessel of the new class of Baden-Württemberg frigates, has been postponed until the first quarter of 2019, according to the German newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military port official.
The ship will be launched in 2014, but the problems that have arisen since construction began have cast doubt on the project's ambitious schedule.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class that the German Navy will take over in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
It is believed that it will include a potent cannon, a combination of anti-missile and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as technology against stealth attacks, radar reduced, infrared sensors and acoustic signatures.
Other distinctive features include longer periods of maintenance: it would be possible to use the new fragates for two years without having to pass through national ports.
However, these delays continue to suggest that the vessels of avant-garde, which are expected to project power to Germany, will be obsolete when they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 will be news next year when the German Navy returns it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a warship to the shipyard in one piece.
There are few details known about the engines, but the Germans have cited various "defects in materials and technology" that would have made the aircraft unusable in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, as approximately 120 mariners, the majority of the crew needed for the old ships of class Bremen, or operate in vessels of class Baden-Württemberg.
In addition, it has been reported that the weight of the aircraft is excessive, which means that in the future the Navy will be able to carry fewer aircraft.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", weighing 7,000 tons, will be twice as heavy as the vessels used by the Germans during the Second World War.
The cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, is also beginning to look like a problem.
It is believed to have cost around 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars)
The problems with the new frigates have become an issue of special importance, considering the recent warnings that indicate that Germany's military power at sea is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the defense committee of the German Bundestag, has acknowledged that the German Navy "has no ships that can be used."
The official has said that the situation has worsened with time because they are going to stop using the old vessels, but they are not going to provide any new ones.
He lamented that he could not unite the Baden-Württemberg class with the Navy.
The National Wildlife Foundation spies on the secret lives of beavers
A new study carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to find out how the red deer use the landscape to feed themselves.
It is hoped that the new discoveries will provide new data on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation efforts.
The study of the scientists at the Royal Botanic Garden at Inverewe in Wester Ross will continue to focus on rare and common plants of the north and west of Scotland.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations on the property to monitor the activities of the beavers during the season.
Volunteers and staff from the National Health Service will also be carrying out mobile surveys with detectors.
The analysis of the sound recordings made by experts will determine the frequency of the calls of each species.
With this information, we will create a report and a map of the habitat to create a detailed image of the landscape at a national scale.
Rob Dewar, head of conservation at the National Trust for Scotland, hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important for red squirrels and how they use each species.
This information will help determine the advantages of green jobs in the housing sector, such as the creation of green spaces, and improving the maintenance of forests for wildlife and other associated species.
The population of red kites in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration of buildings pose a threat to bats, as they can cause the loss of their habitat.
The wind turbines and the lighting also pose a risk, just like the paper wasps and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as the attacks of domestic cats.
In reality, they are not cecs.
However, because of their nocturnal habits of hunting, owls are more useful than eagles when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of localisation to locate insects and obstacles that get in the way of their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is one of the most serious threats.
There are experts with the appropriate training, who carry out surveys, inspections and, in some cases, rescues on a regular basis.
At the end of the day, the organization has created the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to beavers at the Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the two species of beaver in Scotland.
The administrator of the farm, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here, at Threave, we have a great area for red squirrels,” he says.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a good habitat.
However, there are still many aspects of the ratpenat that we have yet to understand, and this work will help us to understand them better.
It is important to check if there have been any ratpenats before carrying out any maintenance work on a property, as this could lead to the destruction of a colony of up to 400 females and juveniles, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
The badgers are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, molest or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of the Scottish Trust for Nature Conservation, has urged the public to go a step further to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about the rats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have any data on their population."
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the accusations of rape against him are "false news" and has said that people "want to be famous" thanks to his name.
Their lawyers will demand that the German weekly Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the accusations.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping a woman from the United States, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in the year 2009.
Presumably, he will have to pay $375,000 for the incident not to be made public, in accordance with the information published on Thursday by Der Spiegel.
In a video on Instagram Live in which he addresses his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, aged 33, is expected to say that they were "false news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, fake news", said the fifth time winner of the Camera d'Or award to the camera.
I have to thank my name for making me famous.
It's normal.
I use my name to make myself famous, but that's part of my job.
A happy home and everything is in order,” he added.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have called "inadmissible information about private life."
Christian Schertz, the player's lawyer, has said that the player is seeking compensation for "damages equivalent to the gravity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant breaches of personal rights in the last few years."
The alleged incident is supposed to have taken place in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After getting to know each other in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to Ronaldo's hotel room, where, presumably, Ronaldo raped Mayorga anally, according to the Clark County District Attorney's office.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo is going to be fined after the supposed incident and will tell him that he is a "99% good guy", except for a "1%".
The documents suggest that Ronaldo is going to confirm that he has had sexual relations with both women, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga also says she will go to the police and have photographs taken of her injuries at the hospital, but she will accept a deal outside the courts because she "didn't want to be humiliated in public".
The woman, who is 34 years old, says she wants to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of signing for Real Madrid from Manchester United in the summer of 2009, but this summer he has signed for Juventus, the Italian giants, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will "always" lose manufacturers of automobiles
The United Kingdom will continue to be a world leader in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
He added that he was "concerned" that the base of Toyota at Burnaston had told the BBC that, if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would have to "temporarily" stop production at the factory.
Clark said, "We need an agreement."
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Auris and Avensis models for Toyota, will produce 150,000 cars this year, of which 90% will be exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, the production of our factory will be affected.
Leaving the EU without an agreement on how to trade with the rest of the EU has awakened the interest of other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW has said it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after the Brexit vote.
The main concerns are that manufacturers will consider risks in the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on a "just in time" system, with fish arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union without a deal on March 29, it is possible that there will be disruptions at the border, which the sector considers could cause delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain inventory for more than a day at the plant in Derbyshire, according to the company, and production would have to be shut down as a result.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU has been "calibrated precisely to avoid those border controls".
We want to reach an agreement. We want to get the best possible agreement that allows us to enjoy the current situation, but also to take advantage of this opportunity.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, indicate that they need to be able to continue with a single exit of chains of production.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long the production will last, but in the long term, it has warned that the costs associated with the plant will reduce its competitiveness and could lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the plant coordinator for Unite the Union, has said that the workers are very worried about the situation: "From experience, if they lose these jobs, they won't come back."
A spokesman for the government has said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could lead to the end of the Russia investigation.
The much-anticipated meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, could be delayed by a week while the battle over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court continues at the White House on Monday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, connections between Russia and the Trump campaign, and possible obstruction of justice on the part of the president.
If Trump pardons or does not pardon the prosecutor general and poses a risk to Mueller's independence, he has fanned the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of using a microphone to record Trump's conversations and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But on Monday he is expected to announce that he is stepping down.
Today, he is going to announce a meeting with Trump, who was in the United States in New York.
Trump has said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but has put off the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing with Kavanaugh and one of his accusers, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump is expected to order the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, which will likely endear him to more of the Senate.
The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, is going to appear on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she will respond as follows: "We haven't set a date yet, it could be this week, but it could also be next week for all the assumptions with the Supreme Court."
But we can already see it. I like to keep up to date with the news.
Some journalists could refute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace is going to ask why.
Sanders will respond that the lack of press conferences was not because he didn't like the fawning of the television journalists, but that he will say: "I won't deny that they are fanfaronades."
In addition, it is expected that there will be more direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president has more sessions of asking and answering questions than the previous president,” he said, before adding, “We have consulted these data.”
Sanders has said that the press briefings will continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me."
We've been trying to do this for a long time, but we've only been able to do it in the last few weeks and we'll replace the informational sessions when we can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump responds to questions about the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press releases are not very common.
This week, in New York, President Obama has demonstrated why, in some moments, he seems to be out of touch with the American people.
The Secretary of State for Health in the United Kingdom has written to the workers of the National Health Service in Scotland to reassure them about the impact of Brexit.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the staff of the European Union working in Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and to wish them continued success after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, will send a letter within six months of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already promised to cover the cost of applications from EU citizens who work in public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes the following: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and it now seems likely that a decision will be reached this autumn.
However, the British government has also begun contingency planning in the event of a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know that these are difficult times for all of you.
For that reason, I would like to reiterate that I appreciate the contribution of all members of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The companies of the EU, and elsewhere, bring a valuable experience and expertise that will strengthen and modernize the health care system, all the while benefiting patients and communities.
By the way, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie underwent an emergency appendectomy after suffering a ruptured appendix.
Christian Abercrombie, quarterback of the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent an emergency appendectomy following Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, has told the press that the injury is likely to keep him out for the middle part of the season.
"He's going to come to the line of scrimmage and he's going to fall over," Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff will give oxygen to Abercrombie before placing him in a litter and carrying him to the hospital.
An official of Tennessee State has informed Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has been released from the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris has added that "we still don't have any information about the type or the amount of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating how much of the injury will be produced.
It is the first season of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, after having been founded in Illinois.
They had won five of their last six games before Saturday's loss, which gave them a total of 18 wins this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the United Kingdom.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the United Kingdom under the Conservative Party's plans.
This action will neutralize the exit of the Corbyn movement among young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will hit those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The government hopes to raise up to 120 million euros a year to help the homeless.
It is expected that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty in order to buy a property in the United Kingdom and these dinners will be used to help the homeless, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the exit of Jeremy Corbyn from the Labour Party by appealing to younger voters with promises to provide more affordable housing.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on those people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; these funds will be used to combat tax evasion.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp tax, will apply to properties with a value of more than 500,000 euros.
The company expects to earn 120 million euros a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new properties built in London are owned by non-British residents, which increases the prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to enter the market.
Many areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" with a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure will come into force seven weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp duty for first-time buyers to help them get on the property ladder.
He is accusing the big construction companies of keeping the prices of land artificially high and not using it, and he is asking May to lower the rates so as to correct the "immobilary disaster" in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including controls on the rental market and the finalization of the "no-fault" evictions.
They will also have more power to build new buildings.
He may have said something like this: "Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British sleep: life should get better for the next generation.
I would like to correct our real estate market, which is very limited.
The United Kingdom will always be open to all those who wish to live, work and create a life here.
However, it is not correct to say that it is just as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as it is for businesses to buy property in comparison with residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a house is still far away and the indignity of those without a house is all the more real.
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to coach Scotland"
The manager of Sunderland, Jack Ross, has said that his "maximum ambition" is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot has accepted the job of reviewing the club from the north-east, which currently occupies third place in the League One, three points behind the leader.
We will be playing at the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren were promoted to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
He said: "I'm going to do it one more time and then that's it."
But I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it's always been a thing that takes me back in time.
This opportunity only comes around once in a lifetime, but I don't think I'll be able to take it.
The predecessors of Ross at Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The manager of Alloa Athletic has said that he does not feel the pressure of being the next in a list of names consecrated in a team as big as this, after having turned down previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my criteria for measuring my success will be whether I can get this team back to the Premier League.”
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its place is in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get here, but I would consider it if I could get back here.”
He only has three years of experience as a coach, after a short stint with Dumbarton and 15 months as the technical director of Hearts.
It will help the Alloa to avoid relegation to the third division and will transform the St Mirren into champions of the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable at Clyde than he did at Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It’s probably going to be a decisive moment,” he said about accepting the job at Alloa.
“We’ve always thought that training was the most important thing, more than playing.”
I'm glad I did it, I had a good time and I enjoyed it.
But it can be very hard to play.
There are many things you have to get over each week.
I still feel the stress and pressure of the job, but I feel good about being a coach.
I've always liked to train and I've been doing it since I was a kid. It's the most comfortable I've felt since I became an adult.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September between 12:00 and 13:00, British Summer Time.
The perfect time to have a pint is at 5:30pm on a Saturday, according to a study.
The heatwave in the UK this summer has caused difficulties for bars and restaurants, but has put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
Bars and nightclubs have seen an increase of 2.7% in sales in July, but restaurant sales have fallen by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, from the financial advisory CGA, the company that has collected the data, says the following: "The hours of sunshine and the participation of England in the World Cup, which has expanded more than expected, have made July similar to June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The reduction of 1.8% in the consumption of restaurants in June has been felt in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of beers, have obtained the best results, while the consumption of restaurants has been at a low.
The bars that offer food have also suffered, but not to the same extent as the restaurants.
It seems that the people only wanted to get out.
The bars and taverns that they have consulted, the sales of castles have increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sales of food have decreased by 3%.”
Paul Newman, one of the analysts at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April."
The time and the impact of great social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to the sale of oranges in the external market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to have problems, but a 4.8% drop in sales over the past year would be particularly damaging, more so than the continuing pressure from rising costs.
This summer has been so long and so hot that it couldn't have arrived at a better time for the markets that serve food and the weather will tell us if the temperatures will be more moderate than they have been in August.
The total number of sales of bars and restaurants, including the recent openings, has increased by 2.7% in July, indicating an increase in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for restaurants, bars and taverns in the United Kingdom reports and analyzes data from 47 operators, with a combined turnover of more than £9 million and is the reference point for the sector.
One out of every five children has a secret account on social networking sites
One in every five children, some as young as 11, have secret Facebook accounts that they use to spy on their parents and teachers, according to a new survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has indicated an increase in the number of "fake Instagram" pages
The news has created fears about the publication of sexual content
The 20% of students say they have a "main" account that they show to their peers.
One out of every five children, some as young as 11 years old, believe that social networks are a threat to adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has indicated a rapid increase in the number of false Instagram accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has created fears about the publication of sexually explicit content.
20% of students say they have a "principal" account that they show to their peers, while also having a "private" account.
A girl who discovers the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter is going to see a message from another girl asking to "violate" her.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of 11- to 18-year-olds have two or more profiles, of which the majority have admitted to having private accounts.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, has said: "It's worrying that so many young people are tempted to create spaces in cyberspace where they can meet their peers and their teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been named director of the executive board of the Scottish Athletics Federation at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is the athlete of the year and track and field in Scotland and the president Ian Beattie is going to describe the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
“The Eilidh has the respect of the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit from her appointment to the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle has said the following: "I have a lot of interest in acting as a role model for athletes and I hope to be able to contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."
The United States, which won the gold medal in the 200 and 400 meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, has won four Olympic gold medals and is currently a commentator for the BBC, will be unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
I wrote the following on Twitter a month ago: "I had a stroke a month ago."
He couldn't walk.
The doctors say that only time will tell if I can recover or not.
It's been sold out, but I've recovered from the whole thing, and now I can walk and do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of support!
An advertisement comparing the sea to cows divides opinion on the Internet
An advertising company has divided opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares the milk of lactating mares with that of cows.
To mark the launch of what is considered to be the "world's first silent menstrual cup", the consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a viral video of a prank to show the freedom that comes with the new menstrual cup.
Four royal mares graze in a large pasture at the rhythm of a song that includes the lyrics: "Yes, I love my mare, but I don't want her to have a foal."
The trend continues: "Bombeja, bombeja, feed the fish, bombeja, bombeja, drown the fish."
The announcement, published on the Facebook page of the company, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has broken a barrier of reactions from those who have seen it, with many saying it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It is a bad decision to use cows to advertise a product.”
With us, they will be embarrassed and ashamed to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their calves only a few days after giving birth.
The tirallet Elvie is discreetly hidden in a lactation support bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person is going to comment on the following: "Completely understandable for the sea and the swimming."
But why not use them to announce a rally for the sea when they still have their fins?
Another user is going to add: "It's an ad out of place."
Other people have defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song "entertaining."
I think it's a great idea.
In purchase you have yet to give birth.
The sound of a shotgun blast is very similar to that of a cow being slaughtered.
The announcement is a bit of a joke, but you have to take it as it is.
It's a great product,” writes a user.
Another person is going to comment on the following: "It's a funny ad aimed at people who are bored at work or at the toilet and feel like they're on a horse.
It's not just an advertising campaign for the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing all along with the hidden supporters.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many people feel like they are being cheated when they use the tirallet.
The Tirallet Elvie is completely silent, it has no cable or tube and fits discreetly in a lactation support, giving women more freedom to move around, breastfeed and, finally, leave the house while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, co-founder and developer of Mother, has declared the following: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves an audacious and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallels between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how they are used and how they are supposed to be used, in a way that is both entertaining and educational.
This isn't the first time Elvie has been in the news.
During the London Fashion Week, two boys are going to appear on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors, silently transferred to a tent camp at the border of Texas
The number of unaccompanied children crossing the border has increased even as monthly entries through the border have remained relatively stable, in part because of the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration.
Traditionally, the majority of godparents were immigrants who had to prove their ability to support the child if they wanted to stay in the country if they decided to adopt a child.
The risk has increased in June, when the federal authorities are expected to announce that the possible sponsors and the rest of the adults will have to send digital fingerprints, which will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection, will testify before the House Judiciary Committee that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have sought to cross the border with unaccompanied minors.
The agency will confirm later that 70% of the arrests did not have criminal records.
“Up to 80% of the people who have come to this country illegally are from a country other than their own, and a great majority of them are criminals.”
For now, they will continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
In order to process the children more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that require that some have to present themselves at the border within a month of being reported missing, instead of 60 days, which was the standard previously.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of in person, in order to defend their case before a judge of immigration.
All those who are not considered fit for assistance will be deported immediately.
With more time spent in foster care, it is more likely that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to run away, according to the workers and the reports that have been released in the last few months.
Advocates say that these concerns can intensify in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of its size, it will pass through all the signs that indicate that a child is present.
They have added that moving the children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends can cause them trauma that will take a long time to overcome.
Syria is calling on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Directing himself to the United Nations General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem is going to ask the refugees to return to their homes, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as vice-premier minister, has said that foreign forces are operating illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will deal with it accordingly."
"They have to be removed immediately and without conditions," he said.
Assad has insisted that the "war on terror" is practically over in Syria, more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of refugees.
He has said that Damascus will continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have cleansed all of Syrian territory of all terrorist groups and foreign interference."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise the Syrian Kurds and Arab rebels who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 war cemeteries on its soil.
On the assumption of the refugees, Muallem has declared that the conditions were good for their return and has blamed "some Western countries" for escaping "irrationally" and leaving the refugees to fend for themselves.
“We have asked the international community and human rights organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are trying to present themselves as purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
The diplomatic representatives of the United Nations have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in Idlib has favored the opportunity to continue with political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces with the help of Russia.
However, Muallem has pointed out that the agreement has "clear terms" and has expressed the hope that the military action will lead to the defeat of the jihadists, who include combatants from the Al-Nusra Front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda.
Staffan de Mistura, sent by the United Nations, is expected to convene the first meetings of a new committee formed by members of the government and the opposition to begin drafting a new constitution after the war and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem will present the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, the task of which will be to review the "articles of the current constitution" and will warn of possible interferences.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020 if, as many liberals probably hope, the Mueller investigation and the impeachment process lead to his removal from office.
This would be, without a doubt, the most dramatic end to a presidency in the history of the United States.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, down from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show," on MSNBC, has led the cable news ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers in prime time.

When I saw Fleiss this week, the temperature was 25 degrees and the sun was blazing outside her house on the north coast of Kauai, but she was sitting in the shade watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
There was no way to dissuade Brett Kavanaugh from testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when I was a kid and we used to watch those programs and the people would say that this was the end of Western Civilization," Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but it seems like they really do have a problem.”

The external dinners in the second half of the legislative term of the Chamber of Representatives are the most adjusted
It is not surprising that there has been a flood of diners in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has forced two current members to compete for the same seat.
This recent reassignment of the district of Pittsburgh implies the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who is going to take the place in another district after the special elections last spring.
Lamb is facing off against another Republican, Keith Rothfus, who represents the 12th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the newly created 17th Congressional District.
The maps are to be redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the state's congressional districts were drawn unconstitutionally in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial backers of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Pennsylvania will now be known as "Pennsilvania" after a narrow victory in a special election held in March to represent the 18th congressional district.
Republicans have occupied the district for more than a decade and President Donald Trump is expected to win the district by 20 points.
The political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposed sanctions on the Salvadoran government for its support of China, but later withdrew them.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized the People's Republic of China, with little response from Washington.
Trump will maintain a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June of 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until his associates were forced to leave the Trump Organization.
Officials of the Department of State will decide to withdraw the diplomatic missions of the United States in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the department, said this month.
In addition, the United States is considering sanctions against El Salvador, which is expected to receive $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, according to estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and better economic conditions.
The proposed sanctions, which would include restrictions on financial aid and visa restrictions, would be detrimental to the country's economy and could lead to an increase in assassinations and terrorist attacks.
With the internal meetings, officials from both countries are postponing a meeting at a higher level focused on security and economic prosperity in order to continue with a similar meeting similar to the one held last year and which will see the two countries moving forward in order to prevent illegal immigration to the United States.
But in September, officials of high rank in the administration will clarify that they want the meeting to take place, and that it will end up being effective, with a high probability of sanctions against the Salvadoran government.
Vice President Mike Pence has been selected to lead the meeting, scheduled for October, as a signal of the importance the administration places on, according to the diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys to the Salvadoran, Panamanian and Dominican Republic have quietly left their posts without issuing harsh words or sanctions from Washington.
The White House is expected to reject the details of the debate that will be discussed by the three officials, which will include two diplomats, who will debate the internal deliberations anonymously.
An external analyst will corroborate the statements.
Study history
The proper implementation of the Mueller report could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, of which there are many proofs in the public record.
According to Mueller, he is also investigating whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on the 2016 elections.
If the Congress changes the rules, Trump could be held accountable by the organization, just as long as he prepares for it before the voters, and, of course, before a jury of members of the party.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or of any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions that have to be taken by all sides of the Atlantic that will determine how long the situation will last.

What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who oversees Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water since this morning when this newspaper is going to report that, next year, he is going to suggest recording secretly the president and will speculate that it was not appropriate for the car.
Rosenstein says the information in the New York Times is not accurate.

Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, is optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers beat the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians would put them in a good position to qualify for the group stage of the Europa League.
An injury to the knee of Graham Dorrans will prevent him from playing the first minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Vila-real, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
“It will be a good position for us, because Vila-real is a good team,” said the player, who is 31 years old.
"We're going to play the game thinking that we can get a good result and come out with a point."
Perhaps we could have something more at the end, but in general, I think empathy is going to be the result.
They will be better in the first part, but they will be better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it's another big night in Europe.
We hope to be able to stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult game as they will be looking for a good result after the last game, but I am sure that we will get a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but it's a good place to be.
The team is good and the players are happy, the training sessions are good.
I hope they can keep it up for the rest of the season and finish the job from last season.
Women lose their pensions when they reach retirement age.
Most participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about their wishes.
Almost all of the respondents at national level say they have spoken to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of the respondents say they have spoken to their children.
“People want someone to take care of them, but they don’t want to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Let's start here.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Thursday, authorities say. It is expected that the death toll will rise.
Due to the lack of communications, the units were unable to obtain information from the regency of Donggala, an area to the north of Palu more proximate to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the extreme end of a narrow coastal plain on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary at the time of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km along the north-eastern coast of the island of Celebes.
The region, an administrative division inferior to a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important to the province, but is concentrated, mainly, in Morowali, on the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years, in accordance with the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Management.
In the year 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996 it also produced a tsunami to the west of Donggala that killed more people.
Indonesia is located at the center of the Pacific Ring of Fire and is prone to frequent earthquakes.
The following is a list of some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
On December 26, 2004, a large earthquake off the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, most of them in Aceh.
In March and April 2005, a series of landslides affected the western coast of Sumatra.
Millions of people are expected to die on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
In 2006, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern tip of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that killed almost 700 people.
In 2009, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people will die.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake in the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra will trigger a tsunami of up to 10 metres that will destroy dozens of villages and kill hundreds of people.
In 2016, a severe earthquake will affect the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and will cause destruction and panic, as the population will remember the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed thousands.
This time, no tsunami is going to be produced, but more than 100 people are going to die because of the buildings that are going to collapse.
In 2018, a series of large landslides will kill more than 500 people on the Indonesian island of Lombok, mostly in the north.
The demolition is going to destroy thousands of buildings and leave thousands of tourists stranded temporarily.
The son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and a candidate for vice president, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, will be arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence, and resisting arrest.
In agreement with the police report, when a known acquaintance tries to trick the police to report a crime, they will stretch out the phone call.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Detention Center, where he is being held without bail, according to KTUU.
He will be sentenced on Saturday, when he will declare "not guilty, with security" when asked how he was declaring himself.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
They are also accused of a lack of class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of 2,000 USD.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of breaking the law.
At the end of 2017 he will be accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Sarah Palin, the mayor of Wasilla, is going to call the police to notify them of the presumed attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the veterans' court in Alaska.
As of 2016, he will be charged with domestic violence, interference with the reporting of a domestic violence incident, and possession of a firearm while under the influence of alcohol.
His wife is going to say that she had given him a slap in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups for associating her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after a landslide triggered by a volcanic eruption on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Thursday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake has caused a tsunami and has caused millions of dollars worth of damage.
Electricity and communications are not working and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase over the next few days.
The landslide occurred on the coast of Central Celebes, in the north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The social networks are circulating videos of the moment of impact.
Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered on the beach in the city of Palu as the tsunami approaches the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a sentence of death for a suspect in the terrorist attack on New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City that killed eight people: a death penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The suspect, 30-year-old Sayfullo Saipov, is believed to have used a Home Depot truck to carry out the attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing eight people and injuring 11 others.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to show that Saipov intended to kill the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" would cause grievous bodily harm, in accordance with the advice of the district attorney of the Southern District of New York.
Both crimes could carry the death penalty, according to the document from the court.
Two weeks after the attack, a grand jury in federal court is expected to indict Saipov on 22 counts, including 11 counts of murder in the commission of a terrorist act, which federal prosecutors can use in cases of organized crime.
Tax officials have said that the attack will require a "considerable amount of planning and premeditation" and have described the way Saipov acted as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
The suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, is believed to have carried out the attack in the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), also known as ISIS.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last execution took place in the southern district of New York City.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, will be sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two drug dealers, but he will be sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal court in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs died of electrocution on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, will not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police are going to explain to the investigators that they felt good about what they had done.
In accordance with the indictment, Saipov is going to explain to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, they will also ask for the ISIS flag to be displayed in their room at the hospital.
He has been found not guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represented Saipov, will say that they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We must consider that the decision to seek the death penalty, in lieu of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton will say.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the court not to seek the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative party in the UK parliament has said that Nigel Farage will be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage is going to promise "to mobilise the popular tropes" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of UKIP has said that politicians must "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of the members of Theresa May's parliament suggested that she would have to lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone is going to tell the people of Birmingham that the United Kingdom is already out of the European Union if Nigel Farage was the Secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenge facing the Prime Minister as she seeks to reconcile the deeply divided ranks of her party has been underlined by the appearance of Conservative MPs in a second protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep her pledge to Chequers between the attacks of the Brexit Party, the Brexit Party, and the EU.
They insist that they will be able to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and the pressure from the Eurosceptics and the conservative party.
The Lord Bone will tell the meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to honour the Chequers agreement.
It is suggested that Lord Farage would have been made a member of the House of Lords and that he would have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If you had been here, we would have been out of here.
The member of parliament for Wellingborough is going to say: "I will defend Brexit, but we need to deliver on Chequers."
In order to emphasize their opposition to the EU, they are going to add: "We will not fight world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws for our own country.
The Lord Bone will dismiss the suggestions that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British public has changed its mind is completely false."
The Conservative Party's Andrea Jenkyns will also be present at the march and is expected to say: "Only Theresa May can save us now."
The compromise of Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular among our party and our activists, who are the people who support us on the streets and advise us on how to win elections.
They abandoned the Chequers agreement and began to follow a different course.
In a letter addressed to Mrs. May, she will add: "The first ministers maintain their feina when they maintain their promises."
The Lord Farage is going to say that the politicians of the meeting have to feel the pressure if they want to overturn the decision taken in the referendum of 2016.
“This is a question of trust between us (the people) and our political class,” he said.
They are here today to tell them that we will not allow them to betray the Brexit vote.
In a message to the jubilant crowd, he added: "I want to say to the political class, you betrayed the Brexit vote."
We are mobilizing the popular tropes of this country that will give us the victory over Brexit and we will not rest until we become a United Kingdom independent, autonomous and proud.
On the other hand, the opposition parties are holding a rally in Birmingham before the two-hour meeting at the center of the city.
A small number of activists will be waving banners against the conservatives following the launch of the group last week.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords, Lord Adonis, is going to resign from the party because of the security problems that the party is facing.
These are the people who tell us that we can have the systems we need and all the technology to make the agreement with Canada even better, for free trade without borders, for free trade with Ireland, without frontiers.
It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a Brexit "soft" exit.
Warren has indicated that she is considering running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said she would consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Saturday, the Democrat of Massachusetts will speak about her future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's running mate in Massachusetts in 2016.
There have been speculations about the possibility of Trump running for re-election in 2020.
The town hall meeting on Saturday will be Trump's 36th town hall meeting with constituents in an open format since he took office.
A member of the audience asked if she had planned to run for president.
Warren will respond that it's time for Washington to "give us our vagina back and fix our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the cabinet."
A person arrested for the murder of three students at LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, will announce on Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Thursday.
The police department of Baton Rouge has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at the press conference of ET at 11:00.
Publish a video of the shooting on Friday and ask the public for help in identifying the shooter.
At 20 years old, he is going to shoot himself and die on the campus of the Southern University in the morning of Friday.

Wayde is going to try to defend his friend and he is going to run the Simpson.
Simpson will be interrogated and will admit to being at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and having shot Wayde Sims.

At 2 meters (6 feet, 7 inches) tall, he is one of the tallest players in the NFL.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton secures the title of the world after winning the race ahead of Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas is going to be in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it will be clear that the orders of the Mercedes team have an important role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost ran out of fuel while defending his position against Hamilton in the first two turns and inviting Vettel to attack him.
Vettel is going to come out of the pits before Hamilton, which would have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes will have to stop at the pits and will come out behind Vettel, but Hamilton will advance ahead of Vettel after a maneuver that will cause the Ferrari pilot to lose the inside line and risk being out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen will start at the back of the grid and finish the first lap in the 21st position on his 21st birthday.
After that, he will continue in a good position in the race, as he will be able to maintain his pace, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and pass him to the fourth position.
Finally he is going to enter the boxes around number 44, but he will not be able to increase the pace for the next eight laps and Raikkonen will be in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri has done a fantastic job all week and will be a true gentleman at the end of the season.
The team has done a fantastic job keeping a 1-0 lead
His body language is going to be terrible
President Donald Trump is going to rip into Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday over her refusal to release the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in Virginia Occidental, the president is not going to speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he will say that the fact that Ford was testifying before the Senate showed that the people were "sad, cruel and mendacious."
"One thing that could pass through the Senate in the last few days, when you are angry, when you are sad, when you are cruel and mendacious," he said.
When you look at the communications and the leaks and they say "No, I wasn't there."
No I haven't.
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you want to filter?
Remember her response... Do you want to filter the document? "Eh, what?"
No, no.
I haven't been able to filter it out.
Yes, I'll wait a minute.
You're going to have to filter... No, no you're going to have to filter that out.
Feinstein is going to re-release the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July, but she is going to deny that the leak came from her office.
“I did not doubt Dr. Ford’s testimony, I did not try to filter her history,” Feinstein will tell the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential.
However, the President's denial is not going to please the Prime Minister, who will say at the meeting on Saturday night: "You know what? Your body language is going to be terrible.
It's probably not going to happen, but it's going to be the best physical language I've ever seen.
Continuing with his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president is expected to suggest that the Democrats are using the allegations for their own political gain.
They are trying to regain control of the means of production.
They don't care about cruelty, they don't care who gets hurt, they just want power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer is going to score two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars will be looking to bounce back from their defeat to the Belfast Giants on Friday when they take on the Elite League leaders on Saturday.
The Giants were able to take a two-goal lead thanks to the late goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to level the playing field, but Dwyer was able to restore the advantage to the Giants.
Francois Bouchard is going to equal the Dundee. After two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen, he is going to secure the victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's home team in the Elite League, who were beaten 2-1 by Dundee on Friday.
It will be the fourth game of the season between the two teams and the Giants have won the three previous games.
The first goal was scored by Dwyer at the 3:35 mark from an assist by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with an assist by David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this period of initial agitation, Sullivan is going to place the home team on the field at the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt facilitates the equalizer at the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer will ensure the advantage of the Giants in the first break when he manages to score the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team is going to regroup and, once again, Bouchard is going to contribute with a goal at the 27:37 mark.
Nielsen and Charles Corcoran have joined forces to give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the second half of the game and will guarantee the victory of their team with the fifth goal at the end of the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are at home, in Milton Keynes, and have their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller saves hundreds of passengers from a plane about to crash into a mountain.
An Indonesian air traffic controller became a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board landed safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many more are missing after a large earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Thursday and triggered a tsunami.
There have been many replicas of the area and many people have been caught in the runes of the city of Palu.
However, despite their best efforts to escape, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the tremulous tower of control at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
In order to ensure that Batik 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to take off safely.
After that, he thought he was falling out of the control tower of the airport.
You're going to die sooner in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, is going to say that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We need to get a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost contact with the helicopter before it arrived in Palu.
That has broken our hearts.
On the other hand, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach 1,000, while the disaster mitigation agency has said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is expected that the number of deaths will increase because there are still many people trapped under the rubble and there are still many people who have not been able to access the area.
The ones, with a height of up to 6 meters, have devastated Palu, which will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial airliners are carrying aid and relief supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old woman, will explain to Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance carries a corpse."
The water is scarce.
All the minicats have been stolen."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, will explain to the CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is working against landslides to help the survivors, but they don't know what they will find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, will arrive in Palu on Sunday and will tell the armed forces: "We need you to work through the night and day to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
Are you ready?" asks CNN.
Indonesia is expected to suffer another major earthquake this year, which could kill more than 550 people.
Air Niugini has reported that a passenger has gone missing after a plane crash in Micronesia.
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean off the Micronesian island of Palau has said that all 47 passengers and the crew have been evacuated safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that no passengers were on board.
The aeronautical industry is working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find it.
The airline will not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels assisted in rescuing other passengers and the crew when the plane went down in the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk International Airport.
The authorities will be able to confirm on Friday that people have been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said Saturday that there were still six passengers in the hospital and all were in good condition.
However, it is still unclear what caused the accident and the exact sequence of events.
Both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force have stated that the aircraft will not be able to land on the runway because it will be too short.
Some witnesses think the plane is going to crash into the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes is going to explain that the plane was flying very low.
Jaynes said, "This is going to be a very positive thing."
Jaynes is going to say that the next and other passengers will be able to walk around with water in their waists until the emergency exits can be opened.
I think they're going to have a panic attack and start screaming, and he's going to get shot in the leg.
The U.S. Navy will say that the sailors who were working on the ship were also helping in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the ship sank.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG airlines, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night when a woman is going to be burned alive.
The prosecutor's office concluded the case on Saturday in the revision of a court's decision to acquit a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The Justice Department's analyst Paul Rowlett will testify for several hours as an expert witness in the analysis of intelligence.
He will describe how the phone records were used to build the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett is going to say that the phone records show that Chambers was with Tellis the night he died, something that contradicts his earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone records show that Chambers was with Michael Sanford at the time in question, the police are going to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford is expected to testify that he was not in the city on the day in question.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford is going to say he lied, because his truck was in Nashville.
Another incoherence is that Tellis will claim that he knew Chambers for two months before he died.
The phone records indicate that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett is going to say that, some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis is going to delete the text messages, the tricks and the contact information of Chambers from his phone.
Hale says, "He's going to have to leave his life behind."
The defense is expected to begin its final arguments on Monday.
The judge is going to say that he expected the jury to reach a verdict by the end of the next day.

Another black person?!
A New York woman has asked for a pair of shoes after receiving a racist message
A New York woman has filed a discrimination lawsuit against her former employer after she received a text message from a co-worker complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple deny they are racist and compare the demand to an extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed consternation to see that the new manager, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived to work for the first time in the new year 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON”, the senyora Plasco-Flaxman writes to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, he sends it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After being fired from her job, a "disgruntled" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman goes to visit Mrs. Maurice, telling her that the woman who had hired her, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino woman, in agreement with the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice is going to pay the full amount for her son's birthday and, after that, send him home with an Uber.
Yes, Maurice demands compensation for the inconvenience and asks for a compensation of, approximately, 350 USD per day for the work he has done for six months for a contract he had not signed.
I'm going to show them that they can't do things like that," he said on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The band has responded to the allegations that they are racists by saying that they are the most reasonable, since they can't trust them after what they have done.
My wife is going to send me something I don't want to hear.
It's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco, the captain of the ship, to the Post.
But, wouldn't you leave your children in the care of someone who has been convicted of child abuse, even if it was a mistake?
A baby?
It's called "Vinga."
Plasco, who has compared the demand to that of an "extortion", will say that she has only two months left to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
Are you trying to catch something like that?
It's not a very nice attitude," said the investment banker.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the public opinion has already condemned the prosecution's behavior and condemned its logic.
The editors of Paddington bear in mind that the readers do not identify with a bear that speaks, in agreement with a new letter
The daughter of James Bond, Karen Jankel, who will publish the book shortly after her father's death, said in relation to the letter: "It's difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who is being published for the first time after their death."
It's very nice to know that there are people who know so much about the great escape of Paddington.
He will explain that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book about a little hedgehog, was optimistic about the future of the book. He will also say that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books will be "agradable", after his father's death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and that his father was very proud of him for finally leaving home.
He was a modest man; he wasn't a show-off.
But Paddington was so real to him, it's almost like when your father advises you to do something: you're proud, even if it's not a good idea.
He considered it like that of Paddington.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always acknowledged the merits of Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
When they land, they carry their daughter to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors are working to save her life.
She often said that it was very difficult and that she didn't expect to succeed.
I'm going to die in the next two minutes and I'm going to say goodbye to Nad.
I'm going to do it.
I said to him: "Tashi, I love you so much."
I'll be going with you.
I'll be going with you.
The drugs that they have been taking to keep their condition under control are now being consumed and are being excreted from their system.
He had been dead before it was supposed to happen and so it went out.
He only had to wait a little longer, as he knew the one who was coming.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was in a situation surrounded by family and friends.
I've got to keep in good shape.
Finally, the lady Ednan-Laperouse, who has been deeply affected by the loss of her daughter, will board the plane with the rest of the passengers, distraught by the experience she has just been through.
“No one knew,” he said.
He had the cap on and the tears wouldn't stop.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad, the flight attendant.
The sensation that I needed from my love and my understanding.
I know that I want it."
Women want targets to prevent suicides at a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been targeted in a bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to call if you need help.
The son of the lady Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want to feel what I have to feel every day," he said.
The 45-year-old woman from Lydney says her son was a promising young man with a bright future ahead of him.
Everyone knows the sound of their own name.
They always said that his shadow could light up any room.
Before he died, he abandoned his trade because he was in a "very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, would later find out that he had his own life.
Mrs. Davis is going to say: "I'm always worried that there will be a collateral effect."
Mrs. Davis is going to create the targets "so that the people know that there are people to turn to, that they can talk to, even if it's just for a friend.
Don't be afraid to speak up: you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies's friend for many years, is going to lose Mark, her company, shortly after the death of her husband.
He's going to say that he wasn't depressed or anything like that, he's going to say.
Two days before Christmas, we will see a change in attitude.
On the day of Christmas, when the children open their presents and don't look at the adults or the presents.
It is said that her death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to work: "Open a hole in the family."
In the end.
But we have to continue and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins an investigation
“I thought if we could get something like what he wanted (an investigation with a limited scope and time frame), we could achieve a certain unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday. He also added that he feared that the committee would be destroyed by the related death of party leaders.
Why didn't the senator want the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters?
His reticence can be seen in the moment.
Only five weeks remain until the mid-term elections on November 6. If, as is expected, the Republicans do not do well, they will be weakened at the time of trying to achieve what they want, which is for the President to be impeached.
George W. Bush has been calling the phone to trick the senators and pressure them to vote for Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush.
What will happen now that the FBI has released its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, at the moment there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Even so, it is not clear if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mr. Pence, the Vice President, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The name of deserters from North Korea is "cau" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has dropped sharply since Kim Jong-un came to power, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification, said that 1,127 North Koreans defected in 2012, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park will say that the strict controls on the border between North Korea and China and the increase in the cost of trafficking people have been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Usually, the vast majority of deserters from the North are offered the nationality of South Korea.
South Korean officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally from North Korea since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Xina considers the deserters to be illegal migrants, in place of refugees and often forcibly repatriated.
The relations between the North and the South, which technically are still at war, have improved considerably in the last few months.
At the beginning of my term, the leaders of the two countries are going to meet in Pyongyang in order to continue negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This will happen after the historic June 12 meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they will agree in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, the foreign minister of North Korea, blamed the lack of progress in denuclearization talks on the sanctions imposed by the United States.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm unilaterally,” said Mr Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi said that Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical figure" and that he is not fit to work at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, will say that Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical figure" and that his temperament makes him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi will make these comments in an interview with the Texas Tribune Festival, which is being held in Austin, Texas.
I can't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was a "historical figure", said Pelosi in relation to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, emotional, is going to deny the accusations of having sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh showed a lot of emotion, sometimes crying and at other times speechless while talking about his family and his years at Yale.
He will also condemn explicitly the Democratic committee and will say that the accusations against him are grotesque and coordinated by a liberal character who is angry at Hillary Clinton because she is going to lose the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi is going to say that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he couldn't work at the Supreme Court, since it showed his prejudices against Democrats.
He said, "I don't think it's a good idea to go after the Clintons and the Democrats at this point."
Pelosi is expected to show some reticence when asked if she would try to block Kavanaugh's confirmation, if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats advise her to do so in the House.
This is what I can tell you: if he did not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, and he is not qualified to be on the trial court, either.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi is going to say that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could make regarding the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he evaded questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions made by the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time for a historic figure and someone with prejudices to enter the Supreme Court and expect us to marvel at them,” Pelosi will say.
Women have to exercise their power.
It's a justifiable diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and no tears to shed.
Steinem said, "We've had it up to here," when she was 45 years old.
"I don't think it's going to be very common. And you?"
It will continue... "It will help a lot of women who were executives in some place that also cried when they were angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when they were angry and started to cry, to tell the person they were talking to: "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying."
I'm pissed off.
And after that, it continued.
It seems brilliant."
Llàgrimes are permitted as an outlet for rage in part because, basically, they are misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have from one of my first jobs is of a woman who was so angry that I burst into tears. It was the director of the company, a woman who had always terrified me a little, who grabbed me by the collar and dragged me up the stairs.
“I don’t want to see them crying,” he said.
They don't know that you're furious.
Think that you are sad and they will cheer you up.
Patricia Schroeder, who used to be a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart is discovered to be having an extramarital affair on a yacht named Monkey Business, Mrs. Schroeder decides to run for president herself.
“It’s not going to be a well-considered decision,” he said as he turned 30 years older.
There were already other candidates in the race and the last thing we needed was another one.
Someone's going to say "Blancaneu and the little ones"
In order to catch up with the campaign, she is going to promise that she will not enter the race if she does not raise 2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovers that some of her supporters, who donate $1,000 to her campaign, are only able to donate $250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she announced that she would not be launching a formal campaign, she was so overcome with emotion (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of recapturing diners and for orienting herself to the voters, in place of the delegates, and the rage, and the sexism)
"I thought I was having a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press.
I could have thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put on my tombstone?
"Are you crying?"
The trade war between the U.S. and China could benefit Beijing.
The initial salvos of the trade war between the U.S. and China will be deafening and, as long as the war doesn't end quickly, the distance between the two countries could prove beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, will issue his first warning at the beginning of this year, when he imposes tariffs on the main exports of China, such as solar panels, aluminum and aluminum products.
The most significant climb of the week will be this one, which will affect products with a value of $200 million.
Beijing has responded in the same way every time and has recently offered $60,000,000,000 worth of benefits to the United States.
China has promised to replicate the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be overtaken in the near future.
If Washington were to back down on some of its demands, it would be seen as a major victory for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
On the other hand, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the trade war with the United States could benefit China in the long run by reducing its dependence on the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for a collapse in any of these countries is much more perilous than what the experts have predicted,” says Abigail Grace, an associate fellow at the Center for New American Security, a Washington-based think tank.
Syria is "ready" to receive the refugees, according to the Minister of External Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war that has lasted more than four years.
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem will say that the conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists have destroyed in order to restore normality.
It is very difficult for all the conditions to be met for the return of refugees to their home countries because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their living standards and their ability to support themselves.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also millions of people who come to the country in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem is going to say that the Syrian regime is doing everything it can to rebuild the country that has been devastated.
However, he will not accept any conditional aid or aid from the countries that are financing the insurgency.
The European Ryder Cup team has been advised to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Ryder Cup team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive matches on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup on European soil since 1993.
The European team will attempt to regain the Ryder Cup when Thomas Bjorn's team arrives at the 14.5 points necessary to win the United States.
American golfer Phil Mickelson, who will be playing in the majority of the tournament, will hit the ball into the water on the par 3 16th hole, which will give the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Francesco Molinari is going to shine in all of his matches and is going to convert into one of the four players who have achieved a 5-0-0 record since the current format of the tournament started in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth will be paired with Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen, the least-qualified player on the European team.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, will lose 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter, from England, who could have been playing in his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran Ryder Cup player Sergio Garcia, who has won 25.5 points in his career, will become the major winner with the most points in the history of the tournament.
I don't want to cry today, but I can't help it.
It has been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for helping me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have won the cup.
The team is the most important... I'm very happy to have been able to help them.
Pass the ball to your compatriot John Ram, who is going to beat the legend of the North American Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
I am incredibly proud to have raised Tiger Woods, I have been following him since he was 23 years old.
Woods will lose the four matches he had against France and he has a record of 13-3-3 in the Ryder Cup.
One of the most remarkable statistics for one of the greatest golfers who has ever lived, with 14 major titles and only one behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. men's golf team will play the entire week, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who will play in PGA Tour events.
The captain of the North American team, Jim Furyk, will speak after the frustrating loss of his team: "I'm proud of these players, they fought hard."
This morning we've had a moment of pressure on the European soccer team.
We've been fighting.
The barret goes to Thomas.
It's a great capità.
His 12 players have played very well.
They regrouped, worked with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progressed.
I'm proud of these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
There is no barret.
They have beaten us."
Reduction of the red tide: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in certain parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there have been more scattered conditions of proliferation in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which suggests a lower concentration.
The proliferation of the red tide has extended approximately 200 km from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
They can be found as far as 16 km from the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places, compared to the situation last week.
The red tide has also been observed in the county of Pasco.
Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have been reported in the coastal counties of Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, Charlotte, Lee and Collier.
Respiratory irritations are continuing to be reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the north-east of Florida over the past week.
