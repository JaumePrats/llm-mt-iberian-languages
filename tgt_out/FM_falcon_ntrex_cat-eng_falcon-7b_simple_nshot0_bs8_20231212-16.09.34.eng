Members of the Galician Parliament concerned about the "Muppets" identity
Several members of the assembly have expressed their consternation at the proposal to change the title of the assembly to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh parliament).
This polemic has arisen from the need to change the name of the Parliament.
The members of the General Assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure could become a source of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party in Catalonia has said that his party is concerned about the fact that MWP is "linked to Twp or Pwp".
For the readers who don't speak Catalan: In Catalan, "twp" means "stupid" and "pwp" means "excrement".
A member of Plaid Cymru's Assembly group has commented that "we don't see eye-to-eye" and has proposed various alternatives.
For their part, a conservative member of the group has affirmed that their group is showing “openness” in front of the change of name, but he will also comment that there is a big difference between the terms “MWP” and “Muppet”.
In this context, tell me that the letter “w” in Galician is pronounced like the letter “u” in English from Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly entrusted with the task of elaborating the legal framework for introducing the changes: “The final decision on the qualification of each member of the assembly will be taken by a majority vote of the members present.”
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Galicia grants the Assembly of Galicia the power to change its name.
The month of June, the committee will publish the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with a wide support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Galicia.
The title of the members of the assembly, even if the committee is going to decide for “Members of the parliament” or “WPM”, the option of “MWP” is the one that is going to have more support in the public consultation.
As it seems, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the intention is to reach a consensus on one of them for the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal basis for the changes in the coming weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the system of the committee.
The members of the assembly will celebrate the definitive vote on the denomination during the debate related to the legislation.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The Catalan Ciutadans party wants to change the name of the country to “Republic of Macedonia of the North”.
The popular consultation will decide on an attempt to resolve a dispute that has been going on for decades with Greece, which already has a province named Macedonia.
Atenes has insisted for a long time that the name of its northern region represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the intentions of this country to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he will ignore the referendum on the name.
Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Macedonia, believes that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the great majority of Catalans have spoken of having a bar and a church in each town”, says the Sr. Adams.
“Today is not the day, but the two”.
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars is possible to understand.
“The people have another way of socialising today”, says.
“The bars are no longer what they used to be.”
What worries the churches, is that the dinners that are obtained from the sale of works of art do not last as long as they predict their leaders “and that it will take at least an hour to get to the place where they will come out.”
The churches, could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the type of people who will not be helped by the temples that remain in the barri.
“The vast majority of people who live in these buildings will be of white race”, he says, “and because of this, it will be necessary to accelerate the demolition of all churches, since it is unlikely that the vast majority of the people who live in these buildings are members of these churches.”
Two churches have been built for white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in 1960.
The white Methodist congregation that had originally been founded in the 30s.
A black congregation has bought the building.
St. Martin's is going to pass to a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who is going to organize a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, one of the main commercial streets of Harlem, which is resisting to contract or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire will cause great damage to the building, and when the reverend Johnson and his parishioners have plans to rebuild it, they will be able to start work on the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of the late Reverend Johnson and successor to the Reverend Johnson of St. Martin's, will describe the pride of the common people.
The expert who is going to sound the carillon in July is going to describe it in a different way: “A cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, is also going to observe the first carillon of the world that will be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who is going to transfer the carillon to the Riverside Church for 18 years.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's will not substitute.
The one who has rung at St. Martin's during the last two months, on the contrary, has been the complicated history of architects and contractors, some of them carried by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the organ of the parish, formed by lay leaders, will write to the diocese at the end of July to express their concern that the diocese “pretengués transmetre the costs” to the parish council, all and that the parish council will not be involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the diocese will send.
Some faithful have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was mauled by a bull in California
A bull is going to attack and injure a 13-year-old boy this Saturday while he was searching for llagostes in California, the first day of the season of llagostes, according to the authorities.
The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) will be located just before the 7:00 a.m. sunrise at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As explained by Chad Hammel to KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been in the water for about an hour when he was rescued by his friends early Saturday morning.
Hammel thought that he was thinking about the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was thinking "I've caught a lobster!"
I had all my clavicle stripped
“Because everyone is coming out of the water, I shouted: 'There's a bull in the water!'”
The child is going to be transported by air to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, we are going to be in a difficult state.
I don't know which species of bull is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, the paramedic Larry Giles is going to comment that they have detected a bull in the area, but that they have decided that this species is not dangerous.
Giles is going to add that the victim suffered head trauma in the upper part of the torso.
The Catalan authorities have closed the beaches at Ponto Beach, Casablad, Swami's and Ecinitas for 48 hours due to the ongoing investigation and for security reasons.
Giles will mark that there are more than 135 species of bull in the area, but that the majority of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, to the market of the beautiful products of the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's has decided to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty products in the style of the big department stores.
These are only a part of the considerable investment in the market for beauty products in the United Kingdom, a market which is worth some 2.8 billion pounds and which continues to grow while the sectors of fashion and beauty products are doing well, and we will try to open 11 new stores in the country this year in order to expand our network.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the desire of the supermarkets to take advantage of the space to offer their services that before were destined to televisions, microones and products of the llar.
Sainsbury's says it will double the number of beauty products it offers, with more than 3,000 different products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also have more space for brands that are similar to the ones you can find in Boots.
The company of supermercats is also in the phase of relaunching its range of makeup products so that the majority of the products are suitable for vegans, a feature that is increasingly demanded by consumers.
The Fragrance Shop will open concessions in two Sainsbury's stores. The first will open next week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The Internet and the change in our eating habits have made it possible for us to buy food in smaller quantities each day at smaller supermarkets. This has meant that the big supermarkets have had to find other ways of persuading us to buy.
According to Mike Coupe, director executive of Sainsbury's, the stores will be getting bigger in order to compete with Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has introduced points of sale for Argos in many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores which it will acquire in total.
The intent of the chain of supermercats to relaunch their departments of beauty products and pharmacy will result in a failure.
Sainsbury's is going to try a joint operation with Boots at the beginning of the decade of 2000, but it is going to end precipitately in not being able to agree on how to divide the benefits of the chain of pharmacies inside the supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale of 281 Sainsbury's pharmacies to LloydsPharmacy, the owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for 125 million GBP.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have a very important paper in the global market, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of products for the skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the appearance of our past products of beauty to improve the environment for our customers."
The Catalan government has decided to set up a working group of experts to provide advice on the matter.
Our range of brands is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the surrounding environment and the practical location make us follow one of the most preferred destinations for beauty products and that challenge the traditional way of making purchases.
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby is paid £11 million
Dragons' Den's Peter Jones is furious after the presenter of television Holly Willoughby is fes inrere d'un tracte de 11 milions GBP amb el negoci de marca d'estil de vida de Jones per centrar-se en els nous contractes amb Marks and Spencer i ITV.
Willoughby did not have time to devote to the joint negotiation of products from the oven and accessories Truly.
The negotiation of these two media personalities had arrived to compare with the mark Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, is going to use Instagram to announce her marriage.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones furious by quitting the show in the last minute of a lucrative deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which she will also be presenting.
According to various sources, Jones was "furious" when the red star of the television admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the contracts of the presenter, for a value of 1.5 million pounds, would imply that he would no longer have time to devote to the joint brand of products of the oven and accessories Truly.
The negotiation had arrived to compare with the mark Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow and it wanted to double the fortune of Willoughby, estimated in 11 milions GBP.
Quan Willoughby, 37 years old, will use Instagram to announce his marriage to Truly, Jones will take a private plane to one of his vacation homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to a font: “Truly was the main priority of Holly.
It was destined to be his future and we would have seen it during the next 30 or 40 years.
His decision to leave will leave no words for all the parts involved.
No one could believe what was going to happen on Wednesday, we were so close...
There’s a shop in Marlow with a lot of things to buy.
According to the experts, the market value of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most recognizable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions of pounds due to the important investment that had been made in products, from coixins and espelmes to roba and roba for the llar, and from the possibility of delays in the launch.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been keeping a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp during the past two years.
Willoughby is going to found a new party with Capp and Jones, both 52 years old, and he is going to be the new president.
Two pairs of identical twins pass the holidays together. In addition, Jones has a 40% participation in the production of television by Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the proper ambassador of Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!
A proper font for Jones to comment on is “We will not comment on the negotiations”.
Dures acusacions... “i després ens vam enamorar”
I will make fun of the possible critics that will come from part of the media for making a comment that some consider “out of place from a president” and for having such a positive opinion of the leader of North Korea.
Why has Trump renounced so much?
Trump is going to say, totally fake news from a news presenter:
“No he renunciat a res”.
You will notice that Kim had an interest in celebrating a second meeting after the first meeting held in Singapore on June 12 was declared a great success in the denuclearization of North Korea.
Tanmateix, the nuclear negotiations are stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho will comment on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” from the United States to its first initiatives for denuclearization.
The United States will continue to apply sanctions with the objective of maintaining pressure.
Trump's point of view, in change, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“I am very happy with North Korea,” he said.
“We declare war on North Korea.”
Millions of people have lost their lives.
I am maintaining this great relationship.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: we have proof of missiles, aid for the release of hostages and the return home of the remains of American soldiers.
I will defend the usual focus of speaking about the relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but when you have 10,000 people trying to get into this place, and you have 200 people, it’s not so easy.”
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths caused by a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the terratracking of Lombok, for example, it will say to the non-governmental organizations in other countries that they were not necessary.
Malgrat that less than 10% of the population of Lombok will be displaced, we will not declare a national disaster, but we will ask for help to be able to internationalize the aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, so the situation is very urgent”, says Mrs. Sumbung.
If Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not sure that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, head of the National Disaster Management Agency, will comment that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if it is possible or not for international agencies to provide assistance at this time.
Give the constant earthquakes that happen in Indonesia, the country is still unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Even though Aceh has built refuges in case of tsunami, they are not frequent in other coasts.
The apparent lack of sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, even though there was an alert in force, is likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the enormous quantity of islands in Indonesia, in the best of the cases, it is a reptile.
The natural disasters complicate the logistics even more.
A rescue ship that was trying to reach the victims of the earthquake in Lombok is heading to Palu; meanwhile, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
The president Joko Widodo had the central element of his electoral campaign on the improvement of the infrastructure of Indonesia, and he invested enormous amounts of money in roads and railways.
Joko's government is facing a crisis because of the huge deficit.
Joko also faced the pressure of the country's sectarian tensions, on members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1000 deaths and thousands of displacements are the result of the clashes that take place on the roads between Christian and Muslim bands with arrows, crossbows, and other bloodthirsty weapons.

Sturridge is going to make a pass of Xherdan Shaqiri at 27 metres from the goal of Chelsea when the team was losing 1 to 0.
I'm going to adjust the steering wheel to the left before leaving an incredible drive behind me.
The shot will cover the entire area with a great elevation while propelling the ball to the right side of the goal.
The pilot finally will start the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in the air and will end up at the bottom of the net.

According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan: "If the investigation is still in a preliminary stage, we would like to hear from anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, which may be of assistance to us."
I would also like to make a call to any person, especially taxi drivers who may have been able to capture something with the camera of the car, which is in contact, because they could have vital information for the investigation.
A police officer has confirmed that the woman is from Birkenhead and that she will be found in a property.
This late, friends who think they know the woman have arrived on the scene of the crime to ask questions about what will happen tomorrow.
While the investigations continue, the police have commented that they are investigating the family members closest to the victim.

The statue of Oliver Cromwell from the British Parliament is the latest monument affected by the debate about “rewriting history”
His disappearance would be a matter of poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England by the puritan fanatics.
The Cromwell Society has described Crick’s proposal as a “bogeria” and an “attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives."
The iconoclasm of the civil wars in England will not be ordered nor directed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the Cromwell will be sacrificed by the incorrect actions of his predecessor in the next century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many people think is worthy of being commemorated.
Goldsmith is going to tell The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, probably more so at the end of the 19th century than at the beginning of the 20th, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy."
If this fet constitutes or does not constitute a totally accurate representation of Roman history.
The one who is sure is that the conflict of media of the 17th century is going to determine the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a band of this division.
The Lord Protector's assoliments are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A pig kills a farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the south-west of the Xina, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with an artery cut and covered in pig blood at a market in Liupanshui, the provincial capital of Guizhou, according to a report by the South China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a farmer was preparing to inject pigs with vaccines in a courtyard in Xining, Qinghai province.
The man who had come from the province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, his cousin will find him dead and he will discover a door open that led to a pigsty.
According to what he said, at the court there was a big pig with blood on its mouth.
The forensic examination will confirm that the garrí of 250 kg had killed the granger, according to the information.
“My cow had her udders broken and full of blood”, said the cow, named “Wu”, according to the news of the evening of Guiyang.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His wife will be found approximately one hour later.
The animal that was going to be killed by the man was not the property of Yuan nor of his.
One of the market's managers is going to comment on the news of the evening that the pig is going to be shot and killed to avoid further attacks, while the police are gathering the evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to information, the family of Yuan and the people responsible for the market are negotiating an indemnity for the death of Yuan.
There have been many cases of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig is going to attack a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and the man is going to have serious injuries.
A few days ago, a pig weighing 300 kg was stolen from a farmer's field. The farmer's wife was able to scare the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba is going to tell the CBC news that pigs are normally not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger”.
He likes to play.
They are children, they have a lot of curiosity... they don't go with the idea of doing bad.
We can only give them the respect they deserve.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to the south-west of the United States
According to the forecasts, the hurricane Rosa is weakening as it approaches the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
The Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States during the proper days.
The Rose had winds of 138 km/h, similar to a category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 am local time on Sunday, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that the Rosa will be displaced to the north on Sunday.
The depression is expected to become a tropical depression in the next few days as it moves towards the west coast of the United States. When it approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday, it will be a tropical storm.
The Rosa will leave on Monday with 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
The tropical cyclone will continue to interact with the subtropical ridge as it moves west-southwestward during the next few days.
At various points, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause serious flooding, flash floods and the risk of landslides.
The strong monsoon will cause heavy precipitation rates of 50 to 75 mm per hour in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Expect 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the south-west, especially in Arizona.
Hi, there is the possibility of forming riuades, as soon as the situation is getting worse rapidly due to the character of the tropical storms.
It is completely forbidden to enter the desert before the imminent threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrollable. In addition, the storms could carry rocks and trees into the gorges.
The depression that is approaching will bring torrential rains in specific areas of the southern coast of California.
It is possible that the total amount of precipitations over 50 mm, which could cause minor flows and minor streams, could be registered.
It's about the first precipitations of the season in the Pyrenees.
The monsoon rains will begin to arrive in Arizona between Thursday night and Friday morning, before becoming more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday morning.
The torrents will escape from the region of the Four Cantons on Tuesday and will persist throughout the rest of the week.
In October there will be some important oscillations in temperature for all of the USA, as the Arctic is cooling, as well as the tropics are cooling.
This phenomenon can cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The region of the center of the United States is a clear example of differences in temperature.
There have been differences in temperature of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the summer days, the persistent heat of the summer will try to expand further.
It is expected that the month of October will start with a lot of heat in the center and east of the United States, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-east.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, which would be 10 degrees higher than the average.
According to the forecast for the long term, there are many possibilities that temperatures will be higher than the average for the first half of October in the United States.
More than 20 million people will be able to watch Brett Kavanaugh's declaration
More than 20 million people will be able to see the passionate testimony of the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who will accuse him of sexual abuse, which is supposed to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony will be broadcast on six different television channels.
The political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting their usual Friday programming because of the events at the last minute: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake so that the FBI could end its investigation into the car crash during a week.
Ford will explain to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh was going to grope her and try to take off her clothes at a party at the institute.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, will affirm that he was absolutely convinced that this would not pass.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers will have seen this testimony on Friday.
The company counted on the spectators of the channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The testimony is not available immediately for other channels that are going to broadcast the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
At the same time, Nielsen has a problem to calculate the number of people that he wants to see from his office.
In perspective, it's about a similar audience to that of a playoff game in American football or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the leaders of opinion of the channel that have clearly supported the nomination of Kavanaugh, will be the channel with the most audience, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the testimony of the whole day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC will be second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS will get 3,1 million, the NBC 2,94 million, the MSNBC 2,89 million and the CNN 2,52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest is maintained after the testimony.
Flake will be the central figure of Thursday's drama.
After the office of the moderate republicans emits a statement saying they will vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake will be captured by the cameras of the CNN and the CBS in the morning of Friday while he was trying to get into an elevator to go to a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
Flake will spend various minutes with his eyes downcast while being interviewed live on CNN.
“Here in tens, in front of you”, she will say to you.
“Do you think that the truth is in the country?”
You have power, while that he has many gifts that do not have!”.
Flake will tell you that his office has already sent out a press release and, before the elevator doors close, he will comment that he has more things to say to the committee.
All cables and all channels are broadcasting live the moment when the Judicial Committee has to vote whether to confirm or not the nomination of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Flake will vote for Kavanaugh, but only if the FBI investigates the allegations in the coming week, which is the condition demanded by the Democrats.
Flake will be convinced in part thanks to the conversations he will maintain with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake will take his decision.
The triad option for Flake had influence, since it was obvious that the Republicans did not have the votes to give their support to Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses the critics of “playing politics” in relation to the Brexit
Theresa May will accuse those who criticised her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the future of the United Kingdom and the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview about the real interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, the former minister of external affairs of May Boris Johnson will reinforce the attack on the name of Chequers for Brexit, it is said that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU are recapting the taxes is "totally absurd".
The assassination of Wayde Sims: The police detain the suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and charged with second degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.

The police confronted separatist Catalans before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Some people were seen in Barcelona last Saturday after the demonstration in favour of independence was confronted by the police and thousands of people joined the counter-demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the vote that is going to take place in Catalonia on the question of secession.
A group of independentists are starting to paint the police cars with black paint, which will cause the appearance of clouds of black smoke on the roads normally used by tourists.
Later on the same day, the police are going to produce batusses with the aim of containing the violent demonstrators.
During various hours, independentist groups have been shouting “No oblidem, no perdonem” (we won’t forgive, we won’t forget) and “Llarga vida a Espanya” (Long live to Spain).
Fourteen people have been injured by rubber bullets during the protests, according to local sources.
The tensions have not decreased in this region of mentalitat independentista one year after the October 1st celebration of a referendum considered illegal by Madrid, but also by separatists Catalans.
The voters in favor of independence for a large majority, and that the index of participation will be low, even if the opponents of the secession will boycott the vote in a majority.
According to the Catalan authorities, more than 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the Catalan regional elections, which led to violent confrontations.
The independentist groups will camp out all night on Thursday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration will take place at the same time, but the demonstrators will be forced to take a different route.
Narcís Termes, electrician of 68 years and one of the participants in the independence demonstration together with his wife, will say that he no longer has any hopes about the possibilities that Catalonia has to become independent.
“Last year was one of the best moments.”
I can see my friends crying with joy at the fact that they can now vote, but we are stuck here.
Despite having won a vital victory, all and all, in the Catalan elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have suffered this year, especially since many of their leading figures have been in self-imposed exile or in jail awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and declaration of independence. 
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, and says that the conflict has revived the politics of both bands.
“The tension does not increase more”, says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the new leaders of Catalonia, will announce that he will participate in the European elections next year.
“Presenting oneself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the retrograde values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish government.”

Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga with Livingston will decide the victory
The Livingston, which last year had been promoted to the category, will surprise the Glasgow Rangers in which it is the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the club of the district of Ibrox.
The play of Dolly Menga will mark the difference, since, with this victory, the team of Gary Holt can go to the second position, which shares with Hibernian.
Gerrard, in change, will continue to play in the Premiership this season. On Sunday, they will face the leader, Hearts, with whom they are separated by eight points.
But before that, the Rangers will play the Rapid of Vienna in the Europa League.
The Livingston, who is still in the first part of the league, with Holt as a coach who faces the defeat when he substitutes Kenny Miller the last month.
The Livingston doesn't take advantage of its opportunities before the direct match of the visitors
Holt's team would have had to score in front of the Rangers' goal much earlier in the match, as their direct play was causing all sorts of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson is going to open the way between the defence, but he is going to mess up the chance when he finds himself in front of the goal. After that, Alan Lithgow is going to send the striker out to stretch himself in order to try and score the pass from Craig Halkett, which is going to create the chance.
As local people already know that the Rangers should stay in their area, because they know that they can cause problems for the visiting teams in games.
This is the decisive goal.
The referee is going to give a foul against the interests of the Rangers and the Livingston is going to open the door, on Declan Gallagher and Robinson they are going to combine so that Menga can touch the first and score from the central area of the field.
At the end of the first half, Rangers had dominated possession, but found a defence that was impenetrable and a goalkeeper in Liam Kelly who had very little to do for the rest of the game,
The scenario is going to repeat itself in the second part, all and that Alfredo Morelos is going to force Kelly to make an aturada of merit.
For his band, the Rangers Allan McGregor is going to play with Scott Pittman and Lithgow is going to score another goal.
The Rangers are going to dedicate a player and another to the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, they are going to claim two penalties, one for a supposed entry of Halkett to the substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other for a foul. Both will be rejected.
Livingston “phenomenal”: analysis
Alasdair Lamont from the BBC Scotland
Great performance and great result for the Livingston.
A man thinks that they will be excellent, and they will surpass all expectations in this trajectory.
His style of play and his personal qualities have not changed since his return to the top flight, and much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has galvanised the team since his arrival.
Hi, we have a good team.
The captain Halkett is going to be immense, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall are going to be dependent on Menga during the whole game.
Rangers will have to find inspiration, although.
Tot i els moments brillants exhibits amb Gerrard com a entrenador, definitivament no han sabut mantenir el nivell.
I don't know how to create chances (only one player can do that clearly), and the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, would have to take it as a warning.
Bad reception for Erdogan in Colonia
Tomorrow and Saturday (29th of September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany are going to meet for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversy visit of the Turkish president Erdogan to Germany, which had as objective to repair the relations between the two allies of NATO.
These have deteriorated due to the assumption of human rights, freedom of the press and the entry of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan, who is following you, is going to Colonia to inaugurate a new mosque.
I am saying that this city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police are going to allege that there is a threat to public security in order to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, if there is a large number of followers, they will block the streets in order to be able to see their president.
Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators against Erdogan, many Kurds, also condemn the political decisions of Erdogan as well as the decision of the German government to welcome them to the country.
The two demonstrations reflect the division of opinions that there is among the visitors, considered a hero by some German Turks and a dictator by others.

The Huracan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with heavy rains (the affected areas could benefit from precipitation)
It is not usual that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is exactly what is going to happen at the beginning of next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for parts of Arizona for Monday and Tuesday, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that the Rosa arrives directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and that it appropriates the night of Monday.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix will comment in a press release that only two tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) will be 64 km from the border with Arizona.
The most recent models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 50 and 100 mm of rain, with peaks of up to 150 mm in Mogollon, Arizona.
Other areas of the desert of the south-west, enclosed by the Rocalloses central and the Gran Conca, could register between 25 and 50 mm, with the possibility of snowfalls of up to 100 mm.
For the areas that are outside the flood risk zone, the Rosa flood could be a very good news, especially since the region is suffering from a strong drought.
Although the floods are a serious cause for concern, some of the precipitations could prove to be very beneficial, as the south-west of the country is currently suffering from a drought.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, more than 40 percent of the state of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
But first, Rosa will land in Baja California, Mexico.
The Rose continued to have strength on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is getting stronger in the Pacific, which makes it lose strength.
Accordingly, it is expected that Mexico will be hit by a tropical storm in the late afternoon or early evening of next Monday.
The precipitations in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of floods.
According to weather.com, "75 to 150 mm totals are expected from Baja California to the north-east of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 250 mm".
After that, the Rose will be directed to the north, creating a storm in Mexico with great force, before arriving at the border with Arizona in the early morning of Tuesday with the force of a tropical depression, to finally arrive at the state of Arizona and arrive at the south of Utah in the middle of the night of Tuesday.
“The main risk of the Rosa or the one that remains of it are precipitations very strong in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora and the desert of the south-west of the United States”, according to the national centre of hurricanes.
It is expected that the plugs will cause dangerous flash floods and mudflows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.

Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rebuke to the despicable tactics and unfair treatment of the Democratic Party.”
Trump is going to say that Kavanaugh has suffered the meanness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh is going to declare before the Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford of having sexually abused her in the 1980s, when they were both teenagers.
Ford is also going to declare to the sight in relation to his al·legat.
The president is going to say on Saturday that, on that day, “the people of America will see the genius, the quality of humanity and the courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the brightest minds in the world of jurisprudence, a jurist with an admirable career of service to the citizenry.”
The president is going to refer indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the participation index of Republican voters in the midterm elections.
“We are six months away from the most important elections in the history of Catalonia.”
I didn't run, but in reality I did.
“For that I have fought for the whole of my life.”
Trump will argue that the Democrats are "resisting and obstructing".
It is expected that the first vote on Kavanaugh's nomination will take place in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday, although it is not yet clear when the full Senate will vote on the nomination.
More than 100,000 people killed by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims continues to increase
At least 384 people have died, and many others have been injured by the floods and landslides caused by torrential rains and a tsunami that have affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to local authorities.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach on Thursday to celebrate a festival with a message of solidarity with the people of Palu, who were hit by a tsunami that killed many people and destroyed everything in its path. 
The tsunami will be followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the threat of tsunami arrived, the people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately. For that reason, some of them were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami is not going to come from the sky, it is going to hit the coasts, trees, houses, it is going to destroy everything that is on the ground”, said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Hi, there are people who want to go to the forest to escape the tsunami and can survive.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency show the quantity of buildings and bridges destroyed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replications will continue on Saturday in this coastal city.
The series of terratrèmols will be felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) will declare on Friday that the energy released by the thermonuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, will be equivalent to 200 times the energy released by the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow valley, could have increased exponentially the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho will describe the damages as “considerable” and will say that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels will be damaged.
Some of the bodies of some of the victims, comments, will be found trapped between the ruins of the buildings collapsed, saying that 540 people will be injured and 29 will be missing.
According to Nugroho, the dead and the injured could increase by 300 km to the north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications “will be totally paralyzed and we will not be able to receive any information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people there
“It is already a tragedy, which could end badly.”
The agency will be severely criticized on Saturday for not informing about the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, and that the agents will say that the waves will arrive during the time when the warning will be issued.
In a recording of an aficionado who shares the social networks, it is possible to feel like a man located on the top floor of a building desperate to warn the people of the street about the tsunami that is approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water crashed into the shore, sweeping away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters will not be able to immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and the tsunami have caused a general mobilization of the Ministry of Electricity, which has interrupted the communications at the moment of Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
Malgrat that the army has started to send humanitarian aid by plane from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, the evacuees are following in desperate need of food, as well as other basic necessities.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for essential flights and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is very hard.
Despite the fact that World Vision’s staff in Donggala could not reach Palu, the employees are staying in tents set up in the parking lot of the office, during the trip they will have to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
“You will see a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
All the aid groups are doing their best to help the victims of the disaster, some people are saying that they are hindering the work of humanitarian aid workers.
In accordance with the Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, the provisions and the deployment of foreign personnel may only begin if a disaster has been declared a national disaster.
This has not yet passed.
“It’s a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, the head of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“A government that says ‘it’s a national disaster’, can start to ask for international assistance, but it hasn’t done so yet.”
While the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami is about to take place, the friends and relatives of the missing people are keeping the hope that the miracle will happen and that their loved ones will be found alive.
On Saturday, a child was trapped in a chimney.
On Sunday, the rescue teams will be able to free a woman who has been trapped under the rubble for two days with the cost of her life.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team of paragliding, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which will conclude at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people arrested at the Hotel Roa Roa, there were also his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional baggage,” he said.
Mr. Gendon is going to explain that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the hotel Roa Roa between the parapentist community, he sent desperate messages to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
Tanmateix, the missed messages appear with a gray verification mark on accounts with a double blue mark.
“I think that’s what you wanted to say, isn’t it?”

Kanye West: the rapper is changing his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is called Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change to Twitter, he wrote: "The fact that Kanye West is formally recognized as Kanye West."
It's been a long time since West, 41 years old, has been using the nickname Ye, and he will use it as the title of his new album, which will be released in June.
The change is produced before the appearance of the program Saturday Night Live, in which it is expected that he presents his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapist replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who is going to cancel her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the artist's current name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think that ‘Amen’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘Amen’.”
“As such, we, too, shall be.”
He passed away from Kanye, which is simply Ye, who is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, all.
The album is more than a reflection of what I see.
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have adopted the name.
Sean Combs has been known by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, anti-collaborator of West, has decided to change his name and write it in capital letters.
The president of Mexico, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
The president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised not to use military force against civilians, because the country is complex 50 years after a brutal repression of students.
López Obrador will promise on Saturday at the Tlatelolco plaza that "we will no longer use the military force to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people in an era in which the student movements of the student movements of the left were allied with the student movements of the left in Latin America.
López Obrador, who has promised to give free university education to young Mexicans,
he has declared that the lack of opportunities for education and the lack of opportunities for work make the young people turn to the criminal bands.
The U.S. wants to double the funds for artificial intelligence
While the Xina is more and more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States would have to double the amount of money they spend on research in this area.
The comments come after several members of the North American government have announced measures in the field of AI, despite the fact that the country has a general lack of strategy in the field of AI.
The Xina will present its plan next year: its objective is to become the number 1 in the world for innovation in AI by 2030.
“Duplicating the pressupost dedicated to research in AI would be a good start, as the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the future in the field of AI,” Lee will say.
“Duplicating the funding could double the opportunities that the U.S. is offering with the great discovery in AI,” Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the founder and CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most prominent AI companies in China.
The year 1980 will be working at the Carnegie Mellon University in a system of AI that will surpass the American player of the Othello with the best classification and, subsequently, will exercise as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese subsidiary of Google.
The Catalan Government will value positively the technological competitions of the past in the North American region, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Projects Research Agency (DARPA), and will ask where the next one will take place in order to identify the proper visionaries.
“Sometimes, the North American scientists have to work hard to get public funding,” Lee will say.
According to Lee, "It's not Xina who got angry with the academics; it's the companies."
In the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired hundreds of PhDs from top universities to work on AI.
Lee is going to comment that the US government in the field of AI can also be affected by the changes in immigration policy.
“We will automatically offer residency permits to foreign PhD students in AI”, says the minister.
In July 2017, the Catalan Government will present its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) grants funds to Chinese institutions of higher education in the same way that the National Science Foundation of the United States (NSF) grants funds to American institutions of higher education. However, the quality of research in China is inferior to that in the United States.
At the beginning of any, the Department of Defense of the United States is going to create a Center of Artificial Intelligence Conjunction, which is going to be composed by experts from the industrial sector and from academic institutions, and the White House is going to announce the constitution of a Select Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, the DARPA has announced an investment of 2 billion dollars in a new initiative called AI Next.
The Fundació de Ciències Naturals, currently devotes more than 100 million USD a year to AI research.
I've been working on this for a long time now, and I'm happy to say that I've finally found a way to make it work.
The Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide if they want the name of the country
On Sunday, the Macedonian people will celebrate a referendum on changing the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed for decades with Greece, which has blocked the country's applications to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern region constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into the NATO and the EU.
The month of June, the two governments will arrive at an agreement on the new name proposed, but the nationalists argue that the change would alter the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic Macedonian population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a campaign of boycott is raising doubts as to whether he will reach the minimum of 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question asked to the referendum is: "Are you in favour of the adhesion to NATO and to the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
The parties of the change of the name, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that will be created from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, organizations such as the EU and NATO.
Today I have voted for the future of my country, because the young people of Macedonia want to live with freedom in the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life.
As long as it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it binding.
To change the name, it requires a majority of two-thirds of the Parliament.
The Catalan Electoral Commission will inform that no irregularities have been detected at the 13 polling stations.
Tanmateix, the participation was only 16%, in comparison with the 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, celebrated in 2016, in which 66% of the people registered voted.
“I have voted for my sons, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, in Skopje.
The Macedonian prime minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko will vote in the referendum on the name change of the country, which would open the way for the country to join the EU and NATO, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
At the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small scenario and placing people in front of the tents installed for the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the Alliance through the front door, not the back door.”
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.”
If they do not want to accept Macedonia, they can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and form part of the European integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that the accession to NATO will be accompanied by investments more than necessary for Macedonia, which has a tax rate higher than 20%.
“I believe that the majority of Macedonians will vote in favor, because more than 80% of Macedonians are in favor of the EU and NATO.”
Zaev will demonstrate that a "yes" would mean a "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies, between 30% and 43% of the voters participated in the referendum, which is below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, directed by the Macedonian channel Telma TV, 57% of the respondents said they would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% would declare that they would vote "yes"
Because the referendum is valid, the participation must be at least 50% more.
A fracas in the referendum would be the first crack in the armour of the pro-occidental government which is going to take power in the next few days.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, from Manchester City, scores a goal after dribbling the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Agüero i Raheem Sterling van anul·lar la defensa del Brighton en la victòria del Manchester City va per 2 a 0 en el partit disputat a l'Etihad Stadium, Manchester (Anglaterra) dissabte passat.
Agüero is going to score a goal in the 65th minute in a play that is going to seem ridiculous.
The forward Argentinian is going to break a pass at the beginning of the sequence.
I'm going to run very fast between three defenders of Brighton, scoring with the one that came out on the field of play.
After that, Agüero will see himself surrounded by four green samarretes.
You'll have to wait until we've conceded a few more goals before you can play in the area in front of the Brighton goal.
Afterwards he will go to his left to find Sterling.
The English goalkeeper is going to be the pilot of the first touch, in the area, with Agüero, who with the right foot is going to beat the goalkeeper of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a shot that is going to go inside the area on the right side.
“Agüero has some muscle problems”, Pep Guardiola, the City’s coach, told the journalists.
We have decided that the game will last between 55 and 60 minutes.
This is what has happened.
We are very lucky to have scored a goal in that moment.
But it will be Sterling who will give the initial advantage to the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League title.
His goal will arrive in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero breaks through the Brighton defense and
He will make a beautiful pass to the left wing for Leroy Sane.
Sane will drive the pilot before passing it on to Sterling at large.
The striker of the Sky Blues is going to finish off the inside of the pitch before leaving the pitch.
The City faces Hoffenheim on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage, at 18:55 h, at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, sense options, vol eliminar els Rockies
With the nationalists eliminated from the play-off, there was no need to force another opening.
But Scherzer, a lot of competition, expects to come out on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who maintain a lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, have a chance to play the play-offs.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Thursday night, but they still need to win one more game to clinch their first division title.
“We don’t care who judges us, at least we can go out there and show what we can do. We know that the other team is probably going to play at a higher level than we have this year. No one has done that this year.”
Why would I want to lose this game?
The Nationals have already announced that Scherzer will start on Saturday, but apparently they are willing to let Scherzer pitch if the situation demands it.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th opening day start, will throw a bullpen session tomorrow and will pitch on Sunday, his usual day of rest.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington has a record of 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump has a meeting in Virginia of the West
The president is going to refer indirectly to the situation of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the participation of Republicans in the midterm elections.
All that we have done in November.
Folding five sets of clothes for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the great, great.. I don't want to present, but in reality I do want to present. For that reason, I'm going to fight for the fantastic candidates.
Trump will continue: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, they're passing it right now."
They have decided to recover the power by all means necessary, they see its meanness, its bad intentions.
It doesn't matter who does wrong, as long as they get the power and the control. That's what they want: power and control. But they won't get it.»
The mission of the democrats, I think, is to resist and to obstruct.
«I can see it in the next four days», he said, and he called the democrats «enutjats, mesquins, bruts i falsos».
Trump is going to fire Dianne Feinstein, the most senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who is going to cause a strong backlash from the public.
Have you read his answer?
Do you want to filter the document?
Eh, eh, what?
No, eh, no. This is going to be a very painful expression of body language, the most painful body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party has ceased to be a diverse party.
It is intolerant with those who think.
If the activists of Momentum from my local party vote to censure me, it will not surprise me.
The last of a series of British parliamentarians who have told us that we are not welcome, all because we think differently.
My colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, is going to present a similar treatment because she is determined against antisemitism.
In my case, with the motion of censure, I will criticize Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe. Irònicament, these are questions similar to those that Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
In the notice of the meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham on Thursday, we want to say that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the major part of my eight years as a Labour councillor, the meetings of the General Committee were held on a Friday night.
Unfortunately, this is not the time for many meetings, and it has been a long time since the promise of "more generous and amiable" politicians has been forgotten.
Every day it is more evident that the divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is justified in function of if it is acceptable for the direction of the party.
This is going to start soon after Jeremy Corbyn has been elected leader, as he and I have been colleagues for a long time and we have always shared a political vision, so it will be interesting to see if he changes his position on national security or on the single market of the EU.
When I speak in public, I always say what I say, the social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which it is said that I am not renewing my candidacy, they are denouncing the politicians of the center and they say that it would not be necessary to be a member of the Labour Party.
This doesn't happen only to me.
Of course, I know that I have more experience than some of my colleagues, because the messages that I send are always political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who every day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and we will not give up.
One of the most disturbing aspects of this era is the normalization of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn will declare this week that the Labour Party has to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the same party, and with each motion of "no confidence" or each change in the rules of selection, the party is being born anew.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and I have been recommended to keep the cap, which is not so expressive and "tot aniria bé"
But I didn't go into politics for that.
As soon as I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my student years, encouraged by the negligent Thatcher government, I will try to defend public services better for those who most need them, either as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I don't hide my political views, nor do I hide them in the last elections.
No-one in Nottingham East could doubt about my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
Those who want to promote the motion on Thursday, I would tell them that in a moment in which the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our businesses and public services, not now is the time to lose time and energy on the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message that I want to transmit is not directed to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, either members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that I will not renew my candidacy or any other political interest will prevent me from doing so, according to my opinion, in the interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: uns Ayr imbatuts encapçalen el liderat
Two late goals distort the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr will win the victory in this vibrant match of the day of the Tennent's Premiership.
The Ayr, who are the only undefeated team in the league, occupy the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team is going to thank their defensive superiority and the fact that they know how to take advantage of the opportunities better, and the coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
“The teams that have played so far have put us to the test and we are still unbeaten, so I am happy.”
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, will give her opinion: "Ayr have taken their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's try at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, puts Ayr in front, but a last-minute try by Rory Hughes, allowed by the Scottish international for the Warriors, allows Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggott to score an unconverted try.
Climo is going to increase the advantage of the Ayr with a sanction and, just in the middle of the match, he is going to score and convert a penalty to put the score at 17-5 in favor of the Ayr.
However, the Melrose will start the second part and the attack of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, will reduce the differences to five points.
After the break, the game will be interrupted for a long time due to the difficult injury that will be suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who will be withdrawn in writing, and the Ayr will return to increase the distance with Stafford McDowall's attack converted by Climo.
Next, the substitute captain, Blair Macpherson, will be warned with a yellow card and, of course, the Melrose will take advantage of the superiority of a home player more than Bruce Colvine's missed conversion at the end of the match.
Tanmateix, the local team is going to react and when Struan Hutchinson is going to see Climo without a pilot, from the line-up, MacPherson is going to score a counter-attack from the rear of Ayr.
Climo is going to mark, as he had already done so at the end of the first half, after Kyle Rowe recovered a cross from David Armstrong and passed the ball to Gregor Henry to score the fifth goal of the local team.
The star of the series Still Game seems to be about to start a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, star of the TV series Still Game, seemed to be about to move into the hotel business, after it was discovered that he had been named director of a restaurant with a license.
The actor, who is 56 years old, plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he wrote and co-produced with Greg Hemphill, his comedy partner for many years.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor is going to refuse to make a comment on the respect, even if one of the journalists of The Scottish Sun is going to point out that Kiernan had the intention of entering the "florent sector of the restauration" of Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, without a coastline, waits for the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The seamen patrol the waters of La Paz.
The public buildings should have a blue flag.
The naval bases of the lake Titicaca from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "The sea is ours.
Recovering him is one of my priorities.
The disappearance of the Bolivian territory without a coastline, the record of a lost coast before Xile in a conflict of resources cruel in the 19th century, which is still very vivid, as it is the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the most profound in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1st after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no, I can’t say it, but I expect a positive result,” says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians watched the resolution of the ICJ in large screens, with the hope that the International Court of Justice will rule in favor of Bolivia, which, after decades of negotiations, Xile is obliged to negotiate the exit to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle for re-election, also has many hopes placed on Tuesday’s vote.
We are very much looking forward to going back to the Pacific Ocean.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that, in case it does, things will not change much.
The organization of the United Nations does not have the power to adjudicate territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The resolution of the ICJ, which is produced only a few months after the presentation of the final pleadings, indicates that the case "was not complicated", will affirm Paz Zárate, specialist in international law.
I lluny de veure's afavorida, la causa de Bolívia pot haver experimentat un retrocés en els últims quatre anys.
The current Bolivian administration has sequestered the question of access to the sea.
The belittling rhetoric of Morales has destroyed any chance of a good will gesture on the part of Xile.
Bolivia and Xile will continue to speak in some moment, but it will be very difficult to maintain conversations after this episode.
The two countries do not recognize each other's ambassadors.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative to The Hague, will reject the idea that the decision of the Court is exceptionally rapid.
Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to start a new era of relations with Xile" and "a unique opportunity to put an end to 139 years of differences, with benefits for both sides", he will say.
Calzadilla is also going to deny that Morales, who follows one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime question as a political crossbow.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to accede to the Pacific Ocean.
“The resolution is an opportunity to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it will not give up its nuclear weapons unless the United States gives up its nuclear weapons
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his country will not give up its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri will speak on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The minister will urge the United States to keep its promises made during a ceremony celebrated in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries.
The Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, seems to be about to resume the nuclear diplomacy that has been stagnant for more than three months after the summit celebrated in Singapore with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
It is a fantasy to think that the continuous sanctions and the objection of the United States to a declaration on the Korean War can make North Korea give up its nuclear program.
Washington has doubts about accepting North Korea's declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament.
Donald Trump wants to celebrate a second inauguration.
Tanmateix, there is a general scepticism about Pyongyang's willingness to give up its nuclear arsenal seriously. The country considers it the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is expected to visit Pyongyang in the coming month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The parades of fashion in Paris reveal the last gamma of big hats, from a main street to a side street
If you want to increase the size of your collection of sunglasses or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you just have to look for more.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers present a collection of exaggeratedly large hats for the SS19 collection, which is going to define the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer the Instagram has been destroyed by barrets, and these designers have brought their surprising creations to the catwalk.
The key piece of Valentino will be a barrette exaggerated, decorated with a large wing, shaped like a plume, which flooded the cap of the models.
In addition to other oversized accessories, there was a barrette, a brooch and, finally, a pine cone, but these accessories were not designed to keep the cap warm.
Thom Browne is also going to present a selection of masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of the colors we use, they look like Hannibal Lecter more than anything else.
A creation was being assembled to a complete set of submarines, with tubes and propellers, while the other seemed to be a cone of ice.
If you follow the big trends of the fashion, you are up to date.
The observers of styles predict that the huge bars could be implanted in the main roads near you.
The bars of large dimensions tremble the bars of "the Bomba", a ball barret, with a wide base, that everyone has carried, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The back tag of the barret is so little used that it is going to escape from the xarxes socials and it is going to bring another great creation to the passarel·la: a bossa de palla for the beach, bigger than the model dressed with banyador that he was wearing.
The bossa of ràfia, of color taronja fosc, decorated with serrells of ràfia and finished with a white leather nansa, will be the highlight of the Jacquemus SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage is going to tell FEMAIL: "I hope to see people wearing big hats and wide-brimmed hats on the main beaches this summer. Taking into account that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a pity to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: The linguistic competences are essential for the citizens of the world
Catalan independent schools in Scotland maintain a trajectory of excellence in academic achievement that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced by the individual and collective efforts in esports, art, music and other community initiatives.
More than 30,000 Catalan-speaking children in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are working hard to offer the best possible service to their pupils and their parents.
The independent schools have as their objective to prepare their pupils for further studies and higher education, for a career and for life as a citizen of the world.
With the sector of education that can design and implement a personalized curriculum, observe that the modern languages follow a subject that is very popular and much desired by schools.
Nelson Mandela will say: "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart."
If you speak in your own language, you will arrive at your own heart».
This is a very important recorder that cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relations and generate confidence with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the exams in Catalan, it can be seen that the languages lead the tables of classification with the highest qualifications at the independent schools.
The 68% of the students who study foreign languages are going to get an A.
The data, collected from 74 member schools of the SCIS, will show that 72% of students will obtain an A in Catalan, while 72% of students will obtain an A in Spanish, 69% of students will obtain an A in French, and 63% of students will obtain an A in Spanish.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland give support to foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will need without doubt in the future.
At the moment, the languages, as a matter of choice, are maintained in the same way as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other places.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the Commission for Occupation and Competences of the Kingdom of Spain will reveal that of the reasons that employers give for not filling vacancies, 17% is going to be attributed to the lack of linguistic competences.
Moreover, the linguistic competences are becoming more and more important in order to prepare the young people for their future careers.
As soon as each time there are more opportunities to develop potential skills that require the use of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
If a person has after a second language, he/she will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence in this language.
The power to communicate directly with people from other countries poses automatically a multilingual person in front of the competence.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among more than 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom, 75% do not know how to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the French, with a 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language education is important for children today.
Knowing various languages, especially those of economic development, will give the children better opportunities to find a good job.
Scotland has diversity between the schools because they teach different languages.
Some schools will focus more on modern languages, while others will focus more on traditional languages, while others will focus more on languages that are considered to be more important for the United Kingdom in the future, such as Arabic or Japanese.
Follow your son's interest, he can always choose between a series of independent schools, which include a specialist teacher in this area.
The independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare the children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of where they go to school.
In the global commercial environment of today, it cannot be denied that the languages continue to have an important role to play in the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
From a linguistic point of view, the modern languages have become "real communicative competencies".
The independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to the young Scots.
You have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron James will debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for the fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The coach of the Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play the first game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But still they have to determine the minutes that he will play.
“They will be more than 48”, Walton said at the official location of the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, reporter of the Lakers, says that probably James will play a few minutes.
After this week's training sessions, I'm going to ask James about his plans for the next six games of the Lakers' preseason.
“I don’t need to play in the pre-season in this phase of my career to be at my best.”
Trump's visit to Virginia West, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia last night.
It is the first of the five meetings that Trump has planned for this week, which will include visits to places that are sympathetic to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for his candidate to cover the vacant seat of the Supreme Court is still pending, Trump is trying to get support for his own election to a second term, since the Republicans run the risk of losing control of the Congress if the elections are held in November.
What time is Trump's speech in Virginia tonight?
Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
The meeting of Trump in Virginia of the West can be seen in the link that is specified below, through the transmission of live video on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will address the Kavanaugh hearing this week, which will be tense because of the sexual assault allegations against him, while the vote to confirm him is on hold until a week from now and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this meeting is to help the Republicans who are present at the delicate elections of November to get elected.
For now, the five meetings of the campaign of President Trump are directed to "encourage the volunteers and the sympathizers, while the Republicans try to protect their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“The control of the Congress is so important for the president’s agenda that he will travel to so many states as possible, at the same time that we will start a campaign season that will be directed against us,” said a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
This Friday night, the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, West Virginia, could be packed with sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh's communication media.
Saturday will be the second time that Trump visits Virginia from the West, the state on will gain more than 40 points from the 2016 election.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate from West Virginia, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good signal for Morrissey that the president is coming to give him a push in the investigations,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Virginia’s College at Wise, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the American team shows its ambition to keep alive the hopes of individual matches on Sunday
After two very unequal sessions, the foursomes on Saturday probably will be the one that this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing of the dynamic is a concept invented, in which the players really believe, especially in this competition.
As well as in the positive dynamic
“We have an advantage of six points and four, so I think we’re in a little bit of a positive ratxa,” said Jordan Spieth as he walked off the course after the final round.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, 12 points in front, with 12 more goals.
The Americans, with Jordan Spieth, say that the wind is in their favor and they have many reasons to be motivated, in large part because of the state of form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will play together all day and both have three points.
Spieth has been lethal off the tee all day and is giving us an example.
Els crits guturals de celebració van pujar d'intensitat mentre continuava la seva volta i va ficar un putt crucial per empatar el quart partit, quan ell i Thomas havien estat dos avall després de dos forats.
You're going to celebrate the putt that you're going to make to win the match at the 15th hole with a putt similar to the one that indicates that you think that the American team is not out of the competition yet.
“You have to work as hard as you can and worry about your own team,” says Spieth.
It's all that's left to these players.
18 forats per deixar empremta.
The two players with the most birdies in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The adorable little girl from Europe is four years old.
«Moliwood» will be the only team that will not make a bogey on Saturday night, and will also avoid the bogeys on Saturday morning and Friday night, and the last ones on Friday morning.
According to this result and the way in which his energy seems to flow into the public, it is reaffirmed that it is only the players who will be playing on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to win a possible European victory while the sun is shining on Le Golf National.
Preferiblement tots dos alhora en forats diferents.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson, the heroes of the morning fourballs, are going to play together with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles against Espanyol and the Swedes in a game in which they will not have many options to get out.
The Sunday, but there is no one who can help me get out of the hole.
The foursomes and the foursomes are very interesting to watch because of the interactions between the teams, the councils that give and the councils that do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change from one side to the other.
The Europeans have played better than the equipment and they will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursomes session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe on top at the end of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after winning the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari will have to make a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficult conditions and leave their record, until now, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who was hoping to retain the trophy he won two years ago at Hazeltine, will dominate an American team that is uncertain about its fourball line-up in the morning foursomes and will take the series 3-1.
The U.S. team has shown more resistance in the foursomes and will be able to reduce the differences.
The equipment of Jim Furyk needed to get eight birdies in the last 12 holes to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to make four birdies in a row, while Molinari, who is known as "Molliwood" after a week of sensational play, is only the second pair to make four birdies in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, Van Rooyen and DeChambeau beat Woods and Bryson DeChambeau for a 5&4 victory.
Woods, who had been drenched in two matches on Saturday, will show flashes of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and consecutively.
Justin Rose, who will not be participating in the fourballs of the morning, will play with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and will win by 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
Tanmateix, Europe didn't have all of its face in a pleasant day and south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times champion of the tournament, and Justin Thomas will establish a new reference point for the Americans on Saturday.
To win a victory with determination against Espanyol with Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and, later, to win again with Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the foursomes, after having lost the first two matches.
Only a few times in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has won a match with a difference of four points, but the team of Furyk, defender of the title, only needs to draw to keep it.
Notwithstanding, after two days, it seems that the counterattack on Sunday is outside of his reach.
North Korea declares it will not disarm unilaterally "in a capricious manner" if there are no signs of confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will inform the United Nations Security Council on Saturday that the sanctions imposed on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continue to intensify the DPRK's distrust of the United States and that, in these circumstances, the DPRK will not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho will tell the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea has taken "important measures of goodwill" during the past year, including dismantling its nuclear test site and ballistic missile facilities, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and related technology.
“Tanmateix, no observem cap resposta en consonància dels EUA”, va dir.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not initiate unilateral disarmament of any kind.”
If Pyongyang is willing to return to the negotiating table to discuss the U.S. approach to denuclearization "step-by-step," the U.S. may be willing to reward Pyongyang for taking incremental steps, as Pyongyang has done in the past. 
Ri will make reference to the joint statement that will be made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a president in office of the United States and a leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim is going to commit to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump is going to promise guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has attempted to pose formally to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has communicated that before Pyongyang has eliminated its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The United States insists that the first step must be the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and increase the level of pressure in order to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "declaration of war" and the "declaration of war".
“The perception that the sanctions will harm us is a chimera of the people who don’t know anything about us.”
But the problem is that the sanctions continue to increase our distrust.
It is not going to refer to the plans to celebrate a second summit between Kim and Trump that the leader of the United States is going to highlight at the beginning of next week.
In that place, the minister will highlight three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in in the last five months and will add: "If the party involved in the question of denuclearization is the Republic of Korea in accounts of the United States, the denuclearization of the peninsula of Korea will not have arrived at this situation of stalemate."
The speech of Ri will be very different from the one he made last year, when he will declare to the General Assembly of the United Nations that launching missiles at the territory of the United States was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump called Kim Jong-un "Rocket Man" in a suicide mission.
Enguany a les Nacions Unides, Trump, who is going to destroy completely North Korea, is going to praise Kim Jong-un for taking measures of disarmament, but he is going to say that there is still a lot to do and the sanctions have to be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Yesterday, Trump said that there was no deadline for this and that "it doesn't matter if it's 2 years, 3 years or 6 months."
China and Russia support that the Security Council of the UN has to reward Pyongyang for its measures.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to tell the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that the U.S. will continue to impose sanctions on North Korea "until the final, fully verified denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
The Catalan Council of Security has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut off the financing of its missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo is going to find Kim out of the UN General Assembly and then he is going to visit Pyongyang to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit is not going to go well.
He will leave Pyongyang at the end of July because he has achieved his goals, but North Korea will accuse him of making "demands on behalf of a gangster."
In a meeting with Moon scheduled for this month, North Korea has agreed to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "measures in consonance."
He said that Kim had communicated that the "measures in consonance" that he was looking for were the measures of security that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions to normalize relations with the United States.
The students of Harvard University study the habits of rest
Enguany, a new course at the University of Harvard has allowed its students to sleep less, in an attempt to combat the culture, each cop more extensive, during the whole night, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic will observe that sometimes students of the university number u of the world are confused by the basic aspects of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, is designing the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
It's going to inspire us to create a course after the break about the impact of the loss of sound on learning.
“At the end of the fair, a woman says to her husband: “Why did I have to go to the fair, all this, in my last year?”
He said that no one had ever spoken so much about the importance of the sound, which will surprise you.
In the course, taught for the first time this year, we explain to the students the basic concepts on how to improve their academic and sporting performance, as well as their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and director of the psychiatric services at the University, is going to say that the University is going to decide to introduce the course after Easter, when some students are going to have a hard time during the week-end.
The course, of one hour of duration, included a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a dormitory, on the students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, blankets and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how it affects sports performance when there is a lack of sleep, and about the importance of maintaining a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, the participants are informed about how the loss of sound can increase the risk of stroke, brain damage, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons animates the participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the conduct of the students will not change immediately.”
However, we believe that they have the right to know, just as we have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on our health.
The Catalan culture of keeping awake all night is still alive, I mean, and it will add that the modern technology and the pressure are growing that the students will be able to cope with the lack of sleep every time more.
To assure oneself of enjoying a good quality sound for a long time would be a "secret weapon" for students to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety, and to avoid having to listen to music, since it is known that the lack of sound puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes the students always have the desire to listen to music.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physics, will help Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond is going to comment that the course has opened the doors and he has been inspired to promote the course in the whole campus.
The next step, according to her, is to ask the students of post-graduate studies to do a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
The professor Czeisler is going to recommend to the students that they set an alarm clock when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: El gol de Menga acaba amb els homes de Gerrard
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at home to Livingston, which means another defeat away from home.
Rangers were looking to add to their first victory at Ibrox since February when they beat St Johnstone 4-1 last month, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as Rangers manager, leaving them eight points behind Hearts at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga is going to score the goal 10 minutes before the end of the first half, and it doesn't seem like the Rangers, who are lacking inspiration, are going to equal the score.
While the Rangers are at the top of the table, the Livingston are in the third position, behind the Hibernian by a difference of goals.
The Rangers could face more difficulties after the judge of the line Calum Spence will need medical attention for a wound caused by an object that apparently was thrown from the stands.
Gerrard is going to make seven changes to the team that will face Ayr United in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other side, is going to play with the same eleven that started against Hearts last week. Of course, he is going to feel satisfied for the way his team, well organized, is going to suffocate their rivals in every moment.
If the Rangers dominate the possession, the Livingston will create more danger than when they have the ball.
In the first 2 minutes of the match, when Menga scored the first goal of the match, Allan McGregor was left out in front of Scot Pittman, but the midfielder was unable to take advantage of the great opportunity.
An off-the-ball foul by Keaghan Jacobs is going to be challenged by Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow is only going to move out of the way at the back post.
The Rangers have the control, but they seem to have more hope than us in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he would have had a penalty at the end of the 15 minutes, just like Steven Lawless and Steven Lawless, but the referee Steven Thomson will ignore the Colombian’s claims.
Rangers only have to deal with two goals at the door in the first half, but the first goalkeeper of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, will not have any problems with the captain of the back, Lassana Coulibaly, and the docile defender Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi the minute 34 could have been against the race, no one can deny that he deserves only for his effort.
Again, the Rangers will not be able to cope with the hard work of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield is not going to react when Declan Gallagher passes the ball to Scott Robinson, who will maintain his composure to score a simple final.
Gerrard will act in the break to change Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change will have an immediate impact, since the extreme will make a pass to Morelos, and Kelly will run to the block.
Nevertheless, the Livingston will continue to attract the attention of the visitors playing exactly as they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
The band of Holt could have given up the lead, but McGregor is going to keep fighting until he beats Jacobs.
The substitute of Rangers Glenn Middleton is going to ask for another penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but now Thomson is going to make the big ones.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
I am a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day in which the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger will develop a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that will finally give us access to what we know as a “Geiger counter”.
The Geiger counter, which is a pillar of modern science, will also become a pillar of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, apparently failed physicists:
Home: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
If you want to listen to the effects of the radioactivity emitted by the minerals.
Evans: "I'm sure it's great!"
Hans Geiger will die in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the one who bears his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer could help the immune system to “see” the malignant cells
A new vaccine against cancer could teach the immune system to “see” and eliminate cancer cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method implies the extraction of immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
It is possible to “see” a common protein in many cancers and, then, reinject them
A vaccine of proof is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells, will see disappear the ovarian cancer that she was suffering from for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and, later, to inject them back.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland (USA): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
The protein HER2 “favours the growth of various types of cancer”, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal, has explained the professor Berzofsky.
A focus similar to that of the immune cells of the patients and “educating” them to attack the cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West is going to wear a MAGA hat in a pro-Trump diatribe after his SNL performance.
It's not going to end well
Kanye West is going to be a guest on Saturday Night Live next week after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he will start criticizing the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
Whenever I speak with white people: How can I please Trump if he's racist?
Yes, if you're worried about racism, you should have moved to the United States a long time ago.
The SNL program will start with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the star of Hollywood is making fun of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it is not going to happen, Chris Rock is going to joke about the disapproval of West on the xarxes socials.
It is not clear if Rock wanted to ridicule West with the publication.
Tanmateix, West has complained to the public that they are not going to be well treated because of the hat they wear.
To threaten with bastidors.
When you go out, don't wear that hat.
Em van assetjar.
I have been told that I am in a lower position" I said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West is going to continue: "Do you want to see the inferior position?" while deia that is posaria the cape of Superman so that així no li podrien dir què ha de fer. "Voleu que el món avance?"
Proveu d’estimar.
His comments have provoked the ire of the public most of the time, and the members of the program's crew seem to be ashamed, according to Variety, which had a reporter who was going to explain to the public: "The study is going to be completely mut."
West is going to bring a last-minute substitute for Ariana Grande, the ex of the one who, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
I Love it, disfressat d’ampolla de Perrier.
The West is going to get the recolzament of the cap del grup conservador TPUSA, Candace Turner, who is going to tuitejar: "A one of the most valents minds: GRÀCIES PER DESTACAR ENTRE LA MULTITUD."
However, the presenter of the program, Karen Hunter, will tweet that West simply was "who you are and who you are absolutely marvelous."
However, he has not rewarded anyone (buying his music or robbing or giving support to his "art") who adopts and defends an ideology that harms my community.
It is free.
We too, will add.
Before the program, the rapper will announce on Twitter that he had canvassed the name and that he was "the one before Kanye West".
It's not the first artist who changes his name and follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, before becoming Snoop Lion, and before the disappearance of the legendary musician Prince, is going to change his name to a symbol and, later, the artist known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder in attempted stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast

The Star of Joc de trons, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for playing the character of Jon Snow in the fantasy medieval violent series of HBO Game of Thrones.
Despite this, the actor, who is 31 years old, has denounced the stereotype of the hero, saying that these papers often give the impression that young people have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times’ Culture magazine, Kit said he believed “something had gone wrong” and that it was a question of how to deal with toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently got married to the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted that she has the determination to face this problem.
“Personally, I’m asking myself what they mean by ‘masculinity’,” he said.
“What have we learned from the children during their development in relation to the problem they are experiencing?”
According to Kit, the television can have part of the responsibility for the increase of toxic masculinity thanks to its characters so virile.
What is innate and what is acquired?
What is meant by the television and the careers that make the young people feel that they have to have this facet of virility?
I think it's one of the great questions of our time: how do I live?
Because I don’t doubt that some things have been done badly with the young people.
At the interview, he will also admit that he would not do a prequel or sequel to Joc de trons when the end of the series is scheduled for the coming summer, but that he is working on battles and horses.
From November, Kit will be the protagonist of the play True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor is going to reveal soon that knowing his girlfriend Rose is the best thing that has happened to him.
“I have met my future wife, so I will give her my future family and my life from now on.”
The paper rose of Ygritte, the love of the character that represents Kit, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that has won an Emmy.
The wedding will take place in June 2018 at the family farm of Leslie, in Scotland.
VIH/sida: The Xina notifies an increase of 14%
The Xina has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Only the second quarter of 2018 will be able to declare 40.000 cases.
The vast majority of cases are of sexual transmission, a difference from what used to pass.
Traditionally, the HIV has been rapidly propagated in some regions of China because of infected blood transfusions.
Despite this, the number of people who have contracted HIV because of this case has been reduced to zero, according to the statements of Chinese health officials in a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is a big problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality is decriminalized in Catalonia in 1997, but the discrimination of the LGBT collective is habitual.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, the studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of those who maintain homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the government of the Xina has promised universal access to medication for HIV as part of an effort to confront the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee of the Senate Democratic Caucus leaked confidential information about Republican senators
The representative of the United States Maxine Waters will denounce on Saturday the accusations according to which a member of her personal had published personal information of three Republican senators of the United States on the pages of the Wikipedia of the legislators.
The democratic mayor of Los Angeles is going to claim that the demands of the extreme right wing are being met.
“Mentides, mentides and more mentides”, says Waters on Twitter.
Apparently, the information published contained the addresses and phone numbers of the senators of the United States Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information will appear on the website on Thursday and will be published in the Senate during a session of the Committee on the Judiciary on the denunciations of sexual abuse against the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The information is going to be filtered after three senators question Kavanaugh.
Llocs conservadors, according to Gateway Pundit and RedState, identify the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was related to the office of Waters and revealed the information of a member of the staff of Waters, to denounce the Capitol.
This accusation without foundation is completely false and a pure lie
The member of my personal, the identity, the personal data and the security of the quality that has been compromised by these false and fraudulent denunciations, will not be responsible for any way of this information leakage.
This accusation without foundation is completely false and a pure invention.
Waters' declaration will generate criticism on the line, including that of the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
This denial is full of indignation.
This makes me think that you don't have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't get angry.
No s'ha de mostrar desafiant.
It is not necessary to question the motives of the accuser.
I have to keep my calm and my serenity.
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who the critics are accusing of seeming angry during yesterday's session.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republican Party, is also presenting himself for the elections of the middle legislature, and also expresses his opinion on Twitter.
Important if it's true
According to his statement, Waters will say that his office had warned the authorities and the security forces about these fraudulent declarations.
“We will ensure that the criminals are revealed, and that they will continue, “and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions that they have committed and that they have caused damage to all members of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again: parody of a limited spy
It is a tradition to refer to the Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this re-release of the parody-action-comedy of Johnny English, which was released in 2003 with Johnny English and will be released again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This is a humorous auto-satire that will be a new opportunity to export the country?
In any case, the incompetent agent of the British Secret Service, Johnny English, has been able to renew his license for a second time in order to continue to operate. His name indicates more than that he is a comic creation designed for the territories of English-speaking countries. 
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare glamur pretensions, has a little bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a touch of this pair that brings a single note to the theme of Cars at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious Atkinson who represented the forgotten ads on television of Barclaycard, which was sowing chaos.
Hi, I had a good time on this last trip to JE.
I really liked the Johnny English who slept in a medieval armor and the blades of the helicopter hit him.
S”hi veu el do que té Atkinson per a la comèdia física, pero el humor parece bastant fluix i estranyament superflu, especialment perquè marques cinematogràfiques "serioses" com 007 i Missió Impossible ara ja inclouen la comèdia com a ingredient.
The humor seemed to be intended for children rather than adults and, for me, the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as funny as the gags of Mr. Bean, who represents Atkinson.
The frequently repeated thesis is that Great Britain is in serious problems.
A pirate informatic has infiltrated the secret network of British spies and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the territory, which provokes the consternation of the agent of service, a paper lamentably small for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last time for a prime minister who is a pretentious and self-important figure, who has already collapsed totally in terms of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself in this character, but the script doesn’t go any further.
Their intelligence officers inform them that, in the case that each spy acted in peril, there will be no retirement.
In this movie, Johnny English, a former MI6 agent, is hired by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to prevent an assassination attempt on his life.
Catalan has returned rapidly to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with the Prime Minister’s press secretary Ben Miller.
Ara Bough is a home boy, attached to the command of a submarine, a very enthusiastic paper, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little underutilized.
Yes, the Batman and Robin of when the things are going to happen in the secret service of His Majesty the King enter in action one more and they find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular “femme fatale” Ophelia Bulletova.
The Catalan prime minister is under pressure from the billionaire technologist who claims that he can solve the information technology problems of Great Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
Catalan: 
All the parades have certainly come to an end in this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and lightness that it presents, it seems like a children’s program.
Things that are quite normal.
With all the other Johnny English films, it hasn't helped to think if the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that does justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it wants to introduce a four-day working week
The Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn will have to consider a radical plan if the British work four days a week and get paid for five.
As a matter of fact, the partit that the caps of the companies pass through the estalvis obtinguts with the revolution of the intelligence artificial (IA) to the workers giving-them a day more of festa.
The employees will enjoy a week of three days off, but the same salary.
According to the fonts, the idea would fit in with the economic agenda of the parties and the plans for inclining the country in favour of the workers.
The change to a week's work in four days counts with the support of the Trades Union Congress, as a method for workers to benefit from the economic change.
An experienced Partit Laborista is going to declare to The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a revision of the policy will be announced before the end of the year.”
It will not be the night of the day, but a week of four days is an aspiration that fits into the perspective of the party to balance the economy in favor of the worker and in the general industrial strategy of the party.
The Catalan Socialist Party would not be the first to give its support to this idea, as the Catalan Socialist Party has already promised a four-day working week during the general elections of 2017.
Nevertheless, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration at the moment.
According to a statement from the Partit Laborista: “A week of work is not political and the party is not political.”
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell will use the conference of the party next week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell will show his determination to restore the power of the "anonymous directors" and the "speculators" to the public services.
The plans of the minister also imply that the shareholders of the water companies could not recover all the investment, since the labour government could apply "deductions" for the crimes that have been committed.
The Catalan government has also confirmed plans to set up funds to buy shares in private companies and create a 10% stake for employees, who expect to receive annual dividends of around 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change his opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview that is going to be published on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley is going to ask Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could turn on the light on something that could change their opinion.
Kennedy showed more openness than his colleague from South Carolina.
I'm speaking seriously.
I said to the judge that I had spoken with Kavanaugh.
I went to the police when I found out about the accusations, and I asked if he had done it.
He was standing firm, determined and sure."
But Graham's vote seems to be important.
I have my own opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would present an explosive accusation.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I’m here to tell you: Brett Kavanaugh is going to deny it.”
“I cap de les persones que nomeni no ho podrà verificar.”
36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents a program of stars absolutely impressive, which ends with a mission equally impressive: eradicate poverty in the world.
In this year's edition of the Global Citizen Festival, thousands of people will gather in Central Park's Great Lawn to watch performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the global goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which will start in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international organizations that aims to end extreme poverty by 2030.
For free entry to the event (if anyone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistants have to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a prank phone call or any other activity to wake up people's consciences about the goal of ending poverty.
Quins exit the Global Citizen project after 12 years to reach their goal
The idea of rewarding the people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them by asking for a call to action or simply a case more of what we call "clicktivism" (people who think that the difference is made by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?)
From the year 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its sympathizers, who have helped to solve various objectives.
Declares that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37,000 million USD, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group will have achieved 390 commitments and undertakings derived from its actions, of which 10,000 million USD have already been recovered or recaptured.
The group estimates that the protected areas have a direct impact on 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and philanthropists with its headquarters in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "helping children to grow as much as possible" and has promised to send $35 million to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“Thank you to the government of the United Kingdom, to donors, to national governments and to members of Global Citizens, like yourselves, who can turn the injustice of malnutrition into a page in the history of humanity”, said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group will also explain that after more than 5,000 actions demanding better nutrition for children, the government will announce the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million children and infants with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F of your website that asked "what do you think that can end up with extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen respongué: "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes we will stumble and sometimes we will fall."
However, with the great movements of defence of civil rights and against apartheid, we will win, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at the event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Mediterranean as a "blockade" to obstruct the export of Russian energy (Interior Secretary)
Washington Post: "If it's necessary, we'll have to go to the Mediterranean to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including those in the Middle East," said Ryan Zinke, the secretary of the interior.
Zinke has denounced that the intervention of Russia in Syria, mainly, operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, and it is a pretext to explore our energy markets.
“I believe that the motive behind the movement is the will to negotiate with the energy, which is already happening in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe.”
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this question.
“The United States have the capacity, together with the Navy, to guarantee that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block, to prevent the energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke was addressing the audience at the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with no ties to the oil and gas industry that calls itself "the voice of energy consumers in the United States."
Compare the strategies of Washington to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and you will see that they are the same.
“The economic option to Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of profiting and substituting for fossil fuels”, he said, while indicating that Russia only has a reserve, since its economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to promote the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, in place of Russian gas, the most economical option for European consumers.
With this final goal, the officials of the Trump administration, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump, try to persuade Germany to abandon the project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline "inadequate", according to Trump, which, according to him, will turn Berlin into "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted repeatedly that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely economic.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of its competence.
I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers, I will declare the Minister of Energy of Russia Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the Secretary of the Department of Energy of the United States Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization of the German industry, FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called the EU to separate the energy policy of the EU and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy policy," said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between the German chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian president Vladimir Putin.
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren has said that she will “seriously consider” running for president in 2020.
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren is expected to announce on Saturday that she will run for president after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirms that she would consider running for president.
The time has come for women to take over the White House and the Senate, and to occupy other important positions.
“After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president very seriously.”
Warren va intervenir sobre el president Donald Trump durante la reunió municipal y va afirmar que "estaba portant el país en la dirección equivocada".
I'm really worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Thursday, Warren will say: "It's clear that the FBI had an investigation before the elections."
A recent poll shows that a majority of Warren's voters think she won't run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of likely voters in Massachusetts say they would not vote for Elizabeth Warren if she were to run for president in 2020, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent of Catalans support the candidacy.
The poll will reveal a stronger support for Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% in favor and 48% against.
Other names of the Democrats who are going to take into account in relation to a possible candidacy for 2020 include the Vice President Joe Biden and the Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden will reveal his decision officially to the president, according to Associated Press.

18 states and the District of Columbia support a new policy on asylum
The States of Catalonia and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new policy of the United States that denies asylum to victims who flee domestic violence or other forms of violence
Representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia will present an amicus curiae brief on Friday in Washington to support a refugee who challenged the Trump administration's policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the request of the case Grace vs Sessions that the United States for Civil Liberties is going to present against the federal policy in August has not been revealed.
You will say that the wife of the member of the violent band is "and the children of the member of the violent band" is going to be attacked, but the North American officials are going to deny her request for asylum on July 20th.
I don't want to live in Texas.
The advocates of the states that give support to Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, on which there is a great number of applicants for asylum in the United States, as countries that face general problems of banditry and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States revoked a decision of 2014 of the Board of Appeals of Immigration, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The general prosecutor of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, is going to declare on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
The federal laws require that asylum requests be adjudicated according to the facts and circumstances of the request, and this prohibition infringes on this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The advocates also argue that the policy that denies entry to immigrants hurts the economy of the United States, since it is more likely that successful entrepreneurs and "jobs that Americans won't do" will move to the United States.
In June, the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is going to order the judges of immigration to not grant asylum to victims who flee domestic violence and gangs.
The asylum is available for those people who leave their country because of persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion.
The asylum has the power to solve all the problems, not only the most serious ones, but also the most common ones, which people face every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to rescue survivors in Palu after quake
For the survivors, the situation is getting more and more desperate.
“The atmosphere is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of two, as she sat calmly with her feverish son in a makeshift evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance carries someone.
Lack of drinkable water.
They have visited residents to see if they can salvage what they can from flooded houses.
There are hundreds of thousands of victims, and the hospitals are full of injured people.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his leg, have been discharged from the military hospital in Palu, because the patients are being transferred out due to the strong aftershocks that continue to occur.
The dogs barked while the man explained how the violent terratrèmol va sacsejar the room of the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and his daughter.
“There was no time to save us.”
He was trapped in the ruins of the house, he said, and he added that his family had witnessed a wedding in the village.
“I felt my wife asking for help crying, and then I didn’t feel her anymore.”
I don't know what happened to her and to my daughter.
I hope you are well.
The US ambassador to China accuses the Chinese government of "propaganda announcements".
One week after a Chinese official publication published an advertisement of four pages in a North American newspaper promoting the advantages of doing business between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the newspaper to spread propaganda.
The president Donald Trump is going to address on Wednesday the supplement of payment of China Daily to The Des Moines Register, the most important newspaper of the state of Iowa, after accusing the Xina of intervening in the elections of the Congress of the United States of America on November 6, 2018, which the Xina denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is meddling in the U.S. elections will mark a new phase of Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
It is normal for the governments of foreign countries to insert advertisements for promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that is intensifying and that has put pressure on the import and export trade between the two countries.
The aranzels of the Xina had the objective of punishing the exporters of states, such as Iowa, that support the Republican Party of Donald Trump, according to experts from China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, said that Beijing has harmed the workers, farmers and businesses in the U.S.
China, Branstad will write an article in an opinion piece to The Des Moines Register on Sunday: "is redoubling the assetjament with the publication of propaganda ads in our free newspaper."
In order to disseminate his propaganda, the governor uses the esteemed tradition of free speech and press in the United States to insert an advertisement for payment to The Des Moines Register.
“In the change, all those who have come here to Beijing, will find few differences and will not be able to find a real reflection of the opinions of the citizens of China on the economic trajectory that the Chinese Communist Party is taking, until the means of communication are dominated by the Communist Party of China.”
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the newspaper.
The Republicans are the voters of women before the elections of mid-term with the disaster of Kavanaugh, warn the analysts
Many of the leading Republicans have given their support and defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have noted that they expect a negative response, especially among women, to the midterm elections.
The emotions that surround this case are extremely high and the majority of the republicans have already shown that they want to make a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be done", will explain Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, in an article to be published Saturday.
Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will say that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will be enough for the FBI to continue its investigation and calm the angry voters.
“The women will not forget what happened today, nor tomorrow, nor in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, principal adviser and national portavoz of the progressive group MoveOn, on Thursday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, the Protestants cry "November is coming!" (November is coming) while demonstrating in front of the Senate vestibule while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decide to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of the Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
The enthusiasm and the motivation of the democrats will be outside the graphic.
The people who have been here before are all dead; it's certain.
But I could have done more, especially among women and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who don't vote while they don't like the president.
After the testimony of Ford, before the confirmation of the candidate to the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that it was possible to produce a negative response if the republicans pressured with the confirmation.
“This has become an embolism for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the Senate or the final vote. It’s also about how the Republicans have managed this issue and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, executive director of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC that helps elect Democrats, to CNN.
The North Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford’s testimony and those who believe in Kavanaugh’s, with the balance of power tilting towards the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of the respondents believe Ford's testimony, while 35% believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
More, a 38 percent say they believe Kavanaugh lied under oath, while a 30 percent say they believe Ford.
After the pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and, at the very least, another woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford will testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee next week under oath that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when they were both 17 years old.
Ramirez alleges that the candidate for the Supreme Court will show his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the open source platform of code of Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to sort through their data and only allow certain people to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that the hidden intention of Inrupt is to "dominate the world".
“I have to go to the office”, he said.
It's a historical moment.
The application uses the technology of the platform Solid to allow users to create their own "personal data space" or a POD.
To contain lists of contacts, lists of tasks pending, a calendar, a music library and other professionals and personal contacts.
It’s like the Google Drive, the Microsoft Outlook, the Slack and the Spotify. They are all available in a browser now.
The person who is excluded from the scope of personal data in the online environment is the user who decides who can access the information.
The company calls itself "empowerment through personal data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the delegate of the company, John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and aptitudes adequate so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a platform for security acquired by IBM, some in-house developers contracted to work on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
Next week, developers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications (dApps) using the tools available on the decentralized web.
Berners-Lee is going to say that none of his team is talking about "Facebook and Google on changing all their business models completely during the night.
“We are not asking for permission.”
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that the “mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated into the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The next two months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over the neutrality of the network.
Fins i tot durant el llançament d’Inrupt, Berners-Lee continuarà essent el fundador i director del World Wide Web Consortium, la Fundaci� World Wide Web i l’Open Data Institute.
“Incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web”, says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebració del clergue de la Creu Victòria de la I GM
The only cleric of the Church of England who will be canonized during the First World War as a combatant has been honored by his city 100 years after his death.
The colonel and reverend Bernard Vann obtained the guard on the 29th of September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Nevertheless, it will be shot down by a fighter plane four days later and the pilot will not know that he had shot down the most important British military honour.
Els seus dos néts van destapar una lápida commemorativa en una desfilada dissabte a Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, will say that it was "magnificently symbolic" that the diamond was presented exactly 100 years after the death of the pilot.
According to The London Gazette, the 29th of September 1918, the colonel Vann will lead his battalion through a thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns.
Later we will run to the line and, with the maximum courage, we will advance the line before launching ourselves onto a canoe with only one paddle and leaving behind three members of the team.
The colonel will be shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) is going to say that the actions of his father and mother were a proposal that could never be equaled, which produces a feeling of humility.
And his son, the Dr. James Vann, will also leave a crown after the parade, directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann will say that he felt very honored to be part of the parade and will add that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he receives from a lot of people.
The fans of MMA who are going to stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, will be able to watch Peppa Pig in their language
Imagine that we stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206 and that we didn’t get to see the most important event.
The billboard of San José contained 13 lights, including six of the main tower and could be seen by the whole of the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing for the fight, the spectators of the United Kingdom will be astonished when the programming will change to Peppa Pig.
Some people were angry because they had to stay up all night to see the demonstration.
A Twitter follower is going to describe the changes in the drawings as "a mouthful of vomit".
The Catalan government says that the 6:00 a.m. slot is not appropriate, so they are going to change the programing, Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, said when asked about the retransmission.
Peppa the pig, yes.
The president of the company Bellator, Scott Coker, is going to say that they are going to work in the programming of the United Kingdom in the future.
When I think about repetition, I think it can work.
“But all the same, they are the sisters of the morning of a Sunday and we can’t get rid of them until Monday at our hour, Tuesday at their hour.”
But we're working.
I'm sorry, when I changed the channel, there were many messages that came in, and not all of them were pleasant.
We're trying to resolve this issue, we think it's a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that. It was a government problem.
I promise you that I will not pass again.
Let them leave in five lights, in place of six normally. They're going to try to make it show up for the followers, but it's going to end.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he has felt inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexual orientation, but that this will provide him with the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old sportswoman has declared that she won’t give up until she goes to secondary school like everyone else.
The Desert Island Discs programme on BBC Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, was talking about the rights of gay people to give hope to other people.
I'm also going to say that it's very important that the Olympic Games are still going on.
The regular presenter of the long-running programme, Kirsty Young, has been on sick leave for several months.
Daley, who will appear on the first program of Laverne, will say that he felt "less than" the others because "it was not socially acceptable for children and children".
Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference, have been real things that have given me the power and strength to triumph.
I wanted to prove that there was "something", I mean, not to deceive anyone when I said that I was "gay".
The bronze medal winner of the 2012 Olympic Games has become a promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was happy to be able to live openly without having to hide his sexuality and that he wanted to give hope to other people.
The triathlon champion of the world is going to explain that he had fallen in love with a man, the American director, Dustin Lance Black, who is going to meet in 2013, "he is going to grab him by surprise".
Last year, Daley is going to marry the winner of an Oscar, 20 years older than her, but the difference in age has never been a problem.
According to him, when he was 14 years old and he participated in his first Olympic Games, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The pair will be named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "the whole of his perspective" has been canvassed.
If I had been asked last year, all that was needed was to win an Olympic gold medal.
There are more important things than the Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is my Robbie.
His son is just like his father, Robert, who is going to die in 2011, at the age of 40, of a brain tumor.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked for was if he already had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell you “wait, you won’t be able to occupy the first row”, he’ll say.
While I was holding him, he stopped breathing and he wasn't going to live any longer, that's why I accepted that he wasn't invincible.
Next year, Daley will compete in the 2012 Olympics and will win the bronze.
“I knew that was what I had been waiting for all my life: to jump in front of a crowd at home in the Olympics. There was no better feeling,” he said.
We will also be inspired by the first song (Proud by Heather Small), which accompanied us during the preparation for the Olympic Games and which still gives us goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs s’emet a BBC Radio 4 el diumenge a les 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is going to present the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The North American Phil Mickelson will break a record by playing his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his physical state if he wants to convert into a lucky tape.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for the 12th time, will be presented by captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
In the place of being at the center of the action, as has been the case in the United States, the referee of the five main tournaments distributes his time between being an announcer and working on the game, with the hope of correcting what he does wrong.
There have not been any more direct drivers, nor as sunny as the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, on the long rough is accustomed to punish the off-line cops.
If Mickelson’s own trajectory is not encouraging, Mickelson, at the next round on Sunday, will face the precise camp of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points ahead at the start of the 12 matches, start strongly, the match of Mickelson could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk will express confidence in this home, without being able to say much more.
“You’ll hear me perfectly on that day, I’ll give you a pat on the back and I’ll wrap my arm around you while I’ll tell you that you’ll be ready for the end.”
I have great confidence in myself.
It's a hall of fame and he has contributed a lot to these equipments previously and this week.
Probably, I didn't imagine playing two matches.
I’ve been thinking about it a lot, but that’s how it is and that’s how it’s going to be.
He will be the same, as any other.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record of most Ryder Cup matches played.
To mean the end of a career at the Ryder Cup, which has not been equal to his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 ties, all of which Furyk has said that his presence has brought intangible benefits to the team.
“He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke around, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great company for the team”, he explained.
“I think that the younger players are also having fun with this week, which has been a lot of fun to watch.”
Add more to the band of your game.
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage in the individual matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn out to be a hard day.
The Spanish team will start the year 1997 at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the American team, but in the end they will win by the minimum, 14,5-13,5.
“And continue to remember that we have a great advantage at Valderrama; we have a great advantage at Brookline, on will lose, and at Valderrama, we will win, but for few”, said Bjorn, in the image, after seeing the victory of the team of 2018 for 5-3 on Friday, as well as the victory of the team of 2019 for 10-6 on Saturday, which leaves the score at 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The history has taught me and all the members of the team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to take the whole machine.
It has to come out and be done.
That's not over until the fat lady sings.
We have a goal, to try to win the trophy, and we have to keep our concentration to do it.
Yes, I have said it, in the 12 players that we have in the team, but also I have present here some of our rivals: the best players in the world.
I am very happy with the performance of my players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn has added: “I will not rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual payment will make the difference and it will change everything.
It's fantastic to be here with such a great company, but the individual duels put to the test the maximum of your capacity to play golf.
This is the message you have to send to the players, the best for tomorrow.
At this moment, leave your company and he will come out and also the best of it.
In opposition to Bjorn, the captain rival, Jim Furyk, expects that his players will perform better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who will add three points.
Furyk knows everything about the money on the last day, because he is going to be part of the winning team at Brookline before losing in the “Miracle of Medinah” that will win Europe.
“I remember all the words”, he replied to the question about how he would motivate Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, on the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start with a good one, as you can see at Brookline and Medinah.”
There is a team that is inspired, there is a lot of pressure in these central matches.
We are preparing the line-up according to the circumstances and the best way to do it.
Thomas is trying to start the counter-attack against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the European players in the first round.
“He triat aquest ordre perquè crec que cobreix totes les possibilitats”, diu Bjorn sobre la seva selecció per als enfrontaments individuals.
The new warplane of Germany, postponed again
The new German battleship will be ready by the end of 2014 to replace the warships of the era of the Cold War, but it won't, at least, until the end of the year, if everything goes well, according to local sources.
The finalization of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the main ship of the new class Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the German newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military source.
The ship will be ready to join the Navy in 2014, but the subsequent problems have marked the end of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the class Baden-Württemberg that the German Navy will replace in 2007 will substitute the old ships of the class Bremen.
It is believed that it will include a potent cannon, a combination of missiles and anti-missiles, as well as technology against covert actions, such as a radar reduced, infrared, acoustic signatures and signatures acoustics.
Other characteristics to be highlighted include longer maintenance periods: it would be possible to use the new fragments for two years without having to pass through national ports.
The fact that these ships are still under construction, and that they are supposed to be able to project power to Germany as a powerful force, will be obsolete when they are put into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 will be news next year, when the German Navy will take back the frigate and return it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned a vessel to the shipyard in one piece.
We don't have many details about the movements of the ships, but the German media have cited various "defects in materials and technology" of the vessel that would have made it unusable in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, because almost 120 seamen, the majority of the crew needed for the old ships of class Bremen, or operate in vessels of class Baden-Württemberg.
More and more, it has also been said that the weight of the vessel is excessive, which means that it is necessary to reduce the weight and limit the capacity of the Navy in the future.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as much as the German ships that were used during the Second World War.
The band of defective materials, the cost of the project, which also includes the training of the crew, is also starting to pose a problem.
It is believed that it has arrived at some surprising 3.100 million euros (3.600 million dollars) starting from an initial pressupost of 2.200 million euros.
The problems of the new frigates have become an issue of special importance, if they are taken into account the recent warnings that indicate that the military power of the German Navy is weakening.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), has said that the German Navy “can't be used”.
The official has said that the situation has worsened with the passage of time because they are going to stop using the ships, but they are not going to provide a new one.
He lamented that the Baden-Württemberg class ships are not able to join the German Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of the rats
A new investigation carried out in a farm in the highlands of Scotland is trying to discover how the red squirrels use the landscape to feed themselves.
It is hoped that the new discoveries will provide new data on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of the natural sciences at the University of Glasgow will continue to be supported by the Foundation for Science and Technology in Scotland, as well as a number of north-eastern Scottish watermills.
They will install special recording devices in the areas of the property to monitor the activities of the rats during the season.
Volunteers and staff of the National Health Service of the Kingdom of Spain will also carry out mobile surveys with detectors.
The analysis of the sounds of the recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the sounds of the rats and what each species makes.
With this information, we will create a report and a map of the habitat to create a detailed image of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation assessor for the National Trust for Scotland, hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important for the species and how they use them.
This information will help to determine the advantages of the management of the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and to improve the maintenance of the woods for birds and other associated species.
The population of rats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has reduced considerably in the last century.
The helmets of construction and restoration of buildings threaten the bats, since they affect the nests and can cause the loss of habitat.
The turbines of wind and the lighting also supposes a risk, as the paper matamosques and the chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as the attacks of domestic cats.
In reality, the rats are not cecs.
Tanmateix, because of his nocturnal habits of hunting, the owls are more useful than the owls when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated localization technique to locate insects and obstacles that get in the way of their flight.
The National Trust for Scotland, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across Scotland, is taking the matter very seriously.
We have experts with the appropriate training, who carry out surveys, inspections and, in some cases, rescues.
Fins and tot, the organization has created the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to beavers at Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the two species of beaver in Scotland.
The owner of the farm, David Thompson, says that it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here, at Threave, we have a great area for red squirrels”, he says.
“We have many old buildings, many old trees and a good habitat.”
However, there are still many aspects of the ratpenats that we do not understand, so the work that is being done here and at other properties will help us to understand better what we need to create.
Emphasizes the importance of verifying if there were rats before doing maintenance work in properties, because it could be that the possible destruction of a newborn colony of 400 females and juveniles, which could mean the disappearance of an entire population.
The rats are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, molest or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, director of the Scottish Seabird Centre, has urged the public to help.
He said the following: "We still have to learn a lot about the rats and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have any data on their population".
Ronaldo denies the accusations of rape while his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the accusations of rape against him are "false news" and he has said that "people want to be famous" thanks to his name.

No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, false news
“I want to be famous thanks to my name.”
It's normal.
I don't want to be famous, but it's part of my job.
A happy home and everything is in order”, he added, sighing.
The lawyers of Cristiano Ronaldo are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have qualified as "inadmissible information about private life", in agreement with Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz has said that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant infringements of personal rights in recent years".

The documents support that Ronaldo is going to confirm that he has sexual relations with both of them, but they will be consensual.
Mayorga also said that she will go to the police and have her injuries photographed at the hospital, but she will accept a later agreement outside the courts because she had "fear of reprisals" and did not want to be "humiliated publicly".
The woman, 34 years old, says she wants to annul the agreement, because she is still traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of signing for Real Madrid from Manchester United in the summer and this summer he has signed for Juventus, the Italian giants, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will always lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom will always be a great place to do business, says Greg Clark, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
He added that it was “worrying” that the base of Toyota in Burnaston, Derbyshire, had told the BBC that, if the UK left the EU without reaching an agreement, it would have to temporarily stop production at the factory.
“We need an agreement”, said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Auris and Avensis models for Toyota, will produce 150,000 cars this year, of which 90% will be exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My point of view is that, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal in March, we will have to stop production at our factory”, said Marvin Cooke, director of operations at Toyota Burnaston.
Get out of the EU without an agreement on trade with the rest of the EU has awakened the interest of other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to the fact that the manufacturers consider risks in the supply chain in case of Brexit without an agreement.
The line of production of Toyota is realitza in a base “just in time”, with fishes that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers of the United Kingdom and the European Union for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on the 29th of March, it is possible that there will be disturbances at the border, which the sector considers that it could generate delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to be halted as a result.
Clark affirms that the Chequers plan of Theresa May for the future relations with the EU is “calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls”.
“We want to reach an agreement. We want to get the best possible agreement that allows us to enjoy the current situation, but also to take advantage of this opportunity.”
“The proofs are not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, that they need to be able to continue with an exit of conjunctions of chains of production”.
Toyota has not been able to confirm for how long it will be able to continue production, however, in the long term, it has warned that the additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite the Union coordinator at the plant, has said that the members are starting to get worried about the situation: “For experience, when these jobs are lost, they don’t come back.”
A government spokesman has said the following: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU”.
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could lead to the end of the investigation
The expected meeting between Donald Trump and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for a week while the fight over the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 elections, the links between Russia and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If Trump does or does not fire the prosecutor general and pose a risk to Mueller's independence, he has fueled the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies the information.
However, the day before yesterday I was going to the White House between rumors that he was going to resign.
Tanmateix, is going to announce on Thursday a meeting with Trump, who was in the United States at the time.
Trump has said that he would prefer not to appoint Rosenstein, but he is postponing the meeting in order to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on Kavanaugh and one of the women who is going to accuse him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Friday, Trump is going to order the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's accusations for a week, which is going to endear him more to the Senate.
The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, will appear on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he will answer the following: "We have not yet set a date, it could be this week, or that we will have to wait another week for all the assumptions with the Supreme Court.
But I've already seen it. I always like to keep up to date with the press.
Some journalists could refute this assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace is going to ask why.
Sanders is going to answer that the lack of sessions was because he didn’t like the fanfare of the TV journalists, but he’s not going to deny that he’s a fanfaron.
It seems to me that the contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president asks more questions and gives more answers than the previous president”, he will say, before adding, without citing any source: “I have consulted these data”.
Sanders has said that the sessions will continue, but “if the press has the possibility to ask directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking with me.
I intend to come soon, I have seen it very much in the last few weeks and I will substitute the informative sessions when I can speak with the President of the United States.
Trump responds to questions when he is at the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences or when he is on an official visit.
The first-person plural pronouns are rarely used.
This week, in New York, the president has demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and, in some moments, distant from the journalists gathered.
The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care wrote to the workers of the National Health Service of Scotland about the fears over Brexit
The Secretary of Health of Catalonia has written to the staff of the European Union that works in the National Health Service of Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and wishes to continue after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, member of the Scottish Parliament, is going to send a letter in the next six months.
The Scottish government has agreed to cover the cost of applications from EU citizens working in public services.
According to his letter, Freeman is going to write the following: "During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and it seems to be heading towards the decisions expected at this late hour."
However, the government of the United Kingdom has also started preparations in case of a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know that these are difficult times for all of you.
For that, I would like to reiterate that I appreciate a lot the contribution of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The companies of the EU, and of course also in our country, contribute a valuable experience and resources that strengthen and improve the health service, at the same time that they benefit the patients and the communities that we serve.
Per descomptat, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after suffering an injury to his head
Christion Abercrombie, the starting quarterback for the Tennessee State Tigers, has been ruled out for the remainder of the season after suffering a knee injury in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ, of the Tennessean.
The coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, has told the press that the injury is going to keep him out for a few weeks.
“He’s going to come to the line of scrimmage and he’s going to fall over there,” Reed said.
The coaches and the medical staff will give oxygen to Abercrombie before putting him in a litter and waiting for him to recover.
An official at Tennessee State University has informed Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has been released from the hospital.
Harris has added that "there is still no information about the type or the amount of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury will be produced.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, from second year, after coming from Illinois.
There were 5 matches left to play when I left the club, which is a total of 18 matches this season.
The foreigners have to pay a higher stamp duty to buy a property in the United Kingdom
The foreigners will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional costs used to help people without a home according to the plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the exit of the Corbyn movement among young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will be levied on those persons who do not pay taxes in the Kingdom.
The Catalan government expects to obtain 120 million euros a year to help the people who don't have a job.
It is hoped that the increase in stamp duty for non-residents buying property in the UK will be used to help people who cannot afford to buy a home, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the exit of Jeremy Corbyn from the votes of young voters with promises of providing more affordable housing that would affect the rents more.
The increase in the stamp duty will be levied on those persons and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; these funds will be used to combat tax evasion.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty rate, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in second homes and speculation in real estate, could be as high as 3%.
Hisenda expects to obtain-ne fins a 120 milions de lliures anuals.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are owned by non-British residents, which increases the prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up to the scale of properties.
Many areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp duty for young people to help them buy their first home.
To accuse the big construction companies of maintaining the high prices of the land and not using it, and to ask May to annul the quotes over the affordable prices to correct the “immobiliarial disaster” of Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, such as controls over the rental market and the finalization of “without guilt”.
We can also give more power to the municipalities to build new roads.
I have said this before: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British sleep: life must get better for the next generation.
This is what we want to correct in our real estate market.
The Great Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
Tanmateix, it's not correct to say that it's the same for people who don't live in the UK, as well as for businesses that work abroad, to buy property in comparison with British residents who work in the UK.
For a large number of people, the dream of having a house of their own is still far away and the indignity of not having a house of their own is still very real.
Jack Ross: “My maximum ambition is to coach Scotland”
The manager of Sunderland, Jack Ross, has said that his "maximum ambition" is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scotsman, 42 years old, has accepted the resignation of the club from the north-east, which currently occupies the third position in the League One, three points from the leader.
I'm going to the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren were promoted to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I want to play for my country when I was a player.
I’d like to call a vote and this is why
“But I grew up playing a lot of games in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it’s something that always takes me back in time.”
This opportunity will only come to me if I have a contract with a club, however.
The predecessors of Ross in the Sunderland job include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The manager of Alloa Athletic says that he is not feeling the pressure of being the next in a list of names that have been consecrated in a team as big as this, after having turned down previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my criteria for measuring my exit will be if I can return this team to the Premier League.”
With the structure and the installations of the club, it is obvious that its place is in the Premier League”, he said.
“It’s not easy to arrive here, but I only think about coming back if I can play.”
Ross only has three years of experience as a coach, after a period with a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months with the technical director of Hearts.
You will help the Alloa to avoid the descent to the third category and you will transform the St Mirren into champions of the Championship the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It’s probably going to be a decisive moment,” he said about accepting the offer from Alloa.
“I always thought that training was the most important thing, more than playing.”
Sona estrany perquè ho vaig fer bé, me'n vaig sortir raonablement i vaig gaudir de prou bons moments àlgids.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things that you have to overcome every week.
However, I feel good as a coach.
I've always liked to train and I've been doing it for a long time, and this is the first time that I've felt comfortable as an adult.

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, according to a study
The heat wave of summer has disappeared from the bars in Great Britain, but it has put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The bars and restaurants have obtained an increase of 2,7% in the sales in July, but the consumption in restaurants has reduced in a 4,8%, according to the statistics.
Peter Martin, the financial advisor of CGA, the company that has collected the data, said the following: "The continuous hours of sun and the participation of England in the World Cup, which has expanded more than expected, have made the month of July similar to that of June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered a little more.
The reduction of 1.8% in the consumption of restaurants in June has increased in July.
The bars and the taverns, leaders in the consumption of begudes, have obtained the best results, while the consumption of restaurants has been at a low.
The bars that offer to eat have also been affected by the sun, all and that it has not been so dramatic as in the case of the restaurants.
It seems that the people only want to go out and have a good time.
The bars and taverns that they have consulted, the sales of houses have increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sales of food have decreased by 3%”.
Paul Newman, from the analysts of the hotel and catering industry RSM, said the following: "These results continue the trend that we saw at the end of April.
The time and the impact of great social events or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to the sales of the external market.
It is not surprising that the restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% interannual would be particularly harmful, more than the continuous pressure on costs.
This summer was so long and hot that we could not have arrived at a better time for the markets that serve to eat and the time will tell if the temperatures more moderate that we have had in August will provide us with this necessary breath.
The total increase in the sales of bars and restaurants, including the recent openings, has been 2.7% in July, as indicated by the presentation of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for restaurants, bars and taverns in the UK tracks sales and trading performance of 47 operators, with a combined turnover of more than £9 million and is the established reference point for the sector.
One out of every five children have secret accounts in social networks that threaten their peers
One out of every five children, some 11 years old, have secret accounts in social networks that threaten their parents and teachers, according to data from a survey
A survey among 20,000 secondary school students has indicated an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The news have made grow the fears about the publication of sexual content
The 20% of the students say that they have a “principal” account that they show to their peers
One out of every five children, some as young as 11 years old, believe that social networks are a threat to adults.
A survey among 20,000 secondary school students has indicated a rapid increase in the number of false accounts on Instagram, a reference to the photo-sharing site.
The news have made grow the fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of the students say that they have a “main” account that they show to their friends, while they also have a “private” account.
A girl who is going to discover the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter is going to see a message from another girl who wants to "violate" her.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, of which the majority have private accounts.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, has declared the following: “It is worrying that many young people are tempted to create spaces in cyberspace with their peers and teachers cannot find them”.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” at the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been named Director of the Executive Board of the Scottish Athletics Federation at the Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is the athlete of camp and track in Scotland and the president Ian Beattie will describe the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his international experience in the last decade.
“The Eilidh respects the community of athletics in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the whole world and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit from her appointment to the board”, said Beattie.
Doyle has said the following: "I have a lot of desire to act as a referee for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute to the development of sport in Scotland".
The United States, which is going to win the gold medals in the 200 and 400 in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympic gold medals and currently is a regular commentator for the BBC, will be prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
I will write the following on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.”
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say that only time will tell if I can recover or not.
I've run out of breath, but I've recovered all of it, I'm going to do some agility exercises now!
Thank you for the nice messages!
An ad about bulls and cows that divides opinion on the Internet
A company of tirallets has divided the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares the milk of cows with that of mares.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent tirallet that can carry the weight of the world", the consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a funny music video to show the freedom that the new tirallet brings to women.
Four mares graze in a large meadow and a flock of sheep at the rhythm of a song that includes letters such as: "Yes, I love my little one, but you won't see it" and "If you don't give it to me, it's not because you don't have it, but because it's mine".
The storm continues: “Bombeja, bombeja, feed the fishes, bombeja, bombeja, feed the fishes”.
Tanmateix, the announcement, published on the Facebook page of the company, has caused controversy on the Internet.
More than 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has broken a bar of reactions, of which many affirm that it shows the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a bad decision to announce the product.”
With us, they will have to be embarrassed and give birth, with the difference that they are separated from their children only a few days after giving birth.
The Elvie is hidden discreetly in a lactation support (Elvie/Mother)
Another person is going to comment the following: “Comprehensible traumatic for the sea and the swim.
But why not use them to announce a tirallet for a mare that would keep her foal?
Another user is going to add: “This is an ad out of place”.
Other people defend the announcement; one woman admits that she found the song “funny”.
“It’s a great idea.”
I'll buy one if I still haven't breastfed.
Bombejar per al tirallet em feia sentir exactament com si fos una vaca.
The announcement is a bit of a lie, but we have to take it as it is.
It’s a great product”, writes a user.
Another person is going to comment on the following: “It’s a funny ad aimed at people who blow their noses with their hands (normally at work or in the bathroom and feel like they’re sick).
It is not the judge who decides that the industry is in Catalonia.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have danced with the tirallet discretely with the supporters.
The concept that underlies the campaign is based on the perception that many people feel as if they were cows when they use the tirallet.
The Elvie is completely silent, it doesn't have a cable or tube and it fits discreetly in a lactation support, which gives women more freedom to move around, breastfeed their babies and, finally, go out while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, co-founder and developer of Mother, has declared the following: “The Elvie Tirallet is such a revolutionary product that it deserves an audacious and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallel between women and cows, we would like to show to the public how the tirallet is used and how it works, at the moment when we demonstrate, in an entertaining and instructive way, the incredible sensation of freedom that it offers.
It is not the first time that Elvie breaks the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a pair of girls will appear on the catwalk for the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children, silently transported to a tent camp at the border of Texas
The name of children who have emigrated has increased even though the monthly entries through the border have remained almost stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and the political measures introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult for children to be adopted.
Traditionally, the majority of godparents are immigrants without papers, who have had to take the risk of staying in the country if they want to stay with their child if they decide to adopt a child.
The risk has increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the possible sponsors and the rest of the adults who have adopted a child will have to send digital certificates, which will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), will testify before the House Judiciary Committee that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have sought to bring unaccompanied minors into the country.
The agency will confirm later that 70% of the arrests did not have criminal records.
“More than 80% of the people who have arrived or are living in a person who has arrived in the country illegally, and a great majority of them are criminals.”
Therefore, they will continue to persecute these people”, said Albence.
To process the children more quickly, the officials have introduced new rules that require that some have to present themselves at the refugee camp within a month of being registered, instead of 60 days, which was the standard before, in agreement with workers at the refugee camp.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of in person, to defend their case in order to obtain the legal status before a judge of immigration.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be deported immediately.
With more time spent with children, it is more likely that they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to run away, according to the workers and the reports they have provided in the last few months.
Advocates say that these concerns can intensify in larger installations, such as Tornillo, and it is more likely that, because of its size, it will pass through all the signs that indicate that a child is present.
He added that taking the children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that they already have to deal with.
Syria calls on the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Directing himself to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Muallem, will ask the refugees from Syria to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also acted as vice-prime minister, has said that foreign forces were operating illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will deal with it accordingly".
“They must be removed immediately and without conditions,” he said.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem has insisted that the “war on terror” has practically ended in Syria, and more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He has said that Damascus will continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have cleansed all of Syrian territory of all terrorist groups and of any foreign presence that is illegal.”
The United States have 2000 troops in Syria, mainly to form and advise the Kurdish and Arab Syrian rebels who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 tropes on its territory because of the war.
On the assumption of the refugees, Muallem said that the conditions were good for their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for escaping "irrationally" and leaving the Syrians to fend for themselves.
“We are calling on the international community and human rights organisations to facilitate these returns”, he said.
“They are trying to make it look like a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
The diplomatic representatives of the United Nations have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in Idlib, the last bastion of the rebels, has favored the opportunity to continue the political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, there are three million people.
Tanmateix, Muallem has pointed out that the agreement has clear "terminis clars" and has expressed the hope that the military action will put an end to the jihadists, which include combatents of the Front Al-Nusra. linked to Al-Qaeda, which will be eradicated.
Staffan de Mistura, sent by the UN, is waiting to convene the first meetings of a new committee formed by members of the government and the opposition to start working on a new constitution after the war and to prepare the way for elections.
Muallem will present the conditions of the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, the pocket of which will have to be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and will warn of possible interferences.
Why Trump will win again
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections in 2020, just as he did in 2016, despite the fact that many liberals probably hope that the scandals and the impeachment process will lead to his removal from office.
Whoever it would be, there would be no doubt that it would be the most dramatic presidency in the history of the country.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
From 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled from 1.05 million to 2.1 million on CNN and almost tripled from 1.6 million to 4.5 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, down from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and “The Rachel Maddow Show,” on MSNBC, has led the cable news ratings with an average of 3.5 million viewers in the prime-time hours.
“The people have seen it coming because they haven’t been paying attention,” says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series “Designated Survivor,” about a White House staffer who becomes president when a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club”, has another theory.
Remember a trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver will tell you that he will vote for Trump.
“Why?”, he will ask.
“He will answer that because he was laughing”, he will say Scovell.
There is a point of entertainment in the chaos.
The difference between the programs of television, the guide that comes from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if the families of immigrants can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
I totally agree with that, being a citizen of the information age and more so when it comes to seeing a group of experts debating the use that Bob Woodward has made of the term “for private use” in his book “Fear”, the jacket of $15,000 of Paul Manafort (“a piece of junk cloth”, says the Washington Post) and the consequences of the descriptions that Stormy Daniels is going to make of the anatomy of Trump.
In my house, I will never see Super Mario again.
“Part of what makes ‘Pawn Stars’ seem like a reality show is that every night we give away something new,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of ‘Pawn Stars’ and creator of ‘Pawn Stars’ about the changes in the cast and the girls in the show’s script.
We can't lose this episode because it's the last one.
I was able to see Fleiss this past week, the temperature was 25 degrees and it was sunny outside of the house that is on the north coast of Kauai, but I was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
Could not be disentangled, not with Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when I first saw those programs and realized that the end of the Western Civilization was at hand,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was a joke, but it seems like they have a point.”

The dinners of the external guests in the Chamber of Representatives during the second half of the legislative term are more adjusted
It is not surprising that there has been an inundation of diners in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has made two current members have to compete for the same place.
This recent reassignment of the suburban district of Pittsburgh implies the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who is going to get the place in another district after the special elections last spring.
Lamb faced off against another representative, Keith Rothfus, who represents the current 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps must be redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has ruled that the districts are unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the 17th district has triggered a financial war between the main financial organizations of the main parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb is going to make a name for himself in Pennsylvania after winning a special election in March to represent the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The Republicans have occupied the White House for more than a decade and President Donald Trump is going to give the district 20 points of difference.
The political experts give the democrats an unfair advantage.
The United States have imposed sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but they will be lifted
Diplomats have observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized the People's Republic of China, with little response from Washington.
Trump is going to have a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until his associates left the management of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department will decide to withdraw the caps of the diplomatic missions of the United States in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for the “recent decisions on the issue of not recognizing Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the department, this month.
Tanmateix, you only have to look at the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which is going to receive $ 140 million in aid from the United States this year, according to the estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and better economic conditions.
The sanctions proposed, which include restrictions on financial aid and restrictions on visas, will be harmful to the country and will increase the number of deaths by murder and assassination.
With the internal meetings, official representatives of both countries are postponing a high-level meeting on security and prosperity to continue with a similar endeavor similar to the one held last year and that will be seen as a step forward in order to prevent emigrants from going to the United States.
However, at the end of September, officials of high rank in the administration will clarify that they want the meeting to take place, and that they want it to end effectively, with a high probability of sanction for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been selected to lead the meeting, scheduled for October, as a signal of the importance that the administration gives, according to the diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys to the Dominican Republic, Panama and the Republic of the Dominican Republic will leave the country in a discreet manner without sending any messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House of Bolton is going to reject the details of the debate that will be discussed by the three officials, which include two diplomats, who will agree to debate the internal deliberations from the anonymity.
An external analyst, appointed by the administration and also from the anonymous, is going to corroborate the declarations.
Study history
The correct interpretation of the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Donald Trump, of which there are many proofs in the public records.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on the 2016 elections.
If the Congress votes to impeach Trump, he could be tried by the International Criminal Court, just as soon as he is prepared for the voters, and, finally, before a jury of members of the party.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump, or of any of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
There are decisions that have to be taken by all the riberas of the Atlantic that will affect how long this situation will last.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the western bloc had resisted and had given support to the Czechs.
If you break and lose the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that will follow.
The course of history fluctuates over points of inflection like this and accelerates or decelerates according to the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States of America is facing various points of inflexion at the moment.
What will happen if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water since yesterday when this newspaper will inform that, last year, he will suggest secretly recording the president and will speculate that it was not appropriate for the pain.
Rosenstein affirms that the information in the Times is not correct.
“If the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it confirms the credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony, will you vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court?”
We, especially, will vote for a Congress that will make Trump responsible?
If I do not succeed in these proofs, democracy will begin to run out of steam.
But I think they won't break, because I've already learned the language in Prague.
My mother was a young Czech deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that will occupy the house of the ambassador.
You'll survive, you'll emigrate to the United States and, 60 years later, you'll send burning crosses on that table with the swastika.
Do you think this is a good bagatge, as I have to be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans, from Rangers, optimistic about the game against Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers beat the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians would put them in a good position to qualify for the group stage of the Europa League.
The injury to the knee of Graham Dorrans will prevent him from playing the first 2 minutes of the season until the draw 2-2 against the Vila-real, but he thinks that the Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to get great results.
“It will be a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team.”
“We’re going to play the game to see if we can get a good result and get out with a point.”
Maybe we could have something more at the end, but, in general, probably the empat will be a result.
They will be better at the first part, but we will be better at the second.
On Thursday, it's another great night in Europe.
We hope to be able to stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they will try to get a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we will give everything and get a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but this is a good place to be.
The team is doing well, the trainings are good.
I hope they can donate it all, leave it there until the end of the season and then take it out.
The women lose their voice when they retire
Most of the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking about it with their family.
Almost all of the national surveys say that they have spoken to their partner about long-term care.
Only 10% of the respondents say they have spoken to their children.
“People want to take care of their loved ones, but they don’t want to plan for it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Let's start here.
Speak with your partner and your children: you can't prepare your family for the future if you don't communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide on and commit to a plan, because these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: we can also help you determine the best way to pay for these expenses.
Your options for financing your long-term care needs may include a long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid long-term care insurance policy, or your own resources, if you have the income necessary to pay for it.
Prepare your legal documents: measure the height of the battles.
Find a representative to be able to designate a person of trust to supervise your medical care and ensure that the professionals complete your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the possibility of contracting a notary for your finances.
Select a person of trust to take financial decisions for you and guarantee that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't worry about the small details: Imagine that your family member has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please specify these details in writing.
The finances are not the only factor that has to be taken into account, but also how many doctors will be able to treat it.
Quins are the medicines?
Who will care for the gos?
This recipe was prepared by me.

Terratrèmols and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Thursday, according to the authorities. It is expected that the number of deaths will increase.
As far as the communications are concerned, the units have not been able to obtain information from the regency of Donggala, a more proximate area to the epicenter of the earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some important data about Palu and Donggala, the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the extreme west of the narrow coastal strip of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that is more than 300 km from the north-west coast of the island of Celebes.
The region, a lower administrative region than a province, had a population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but is concentrated, mainly, in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by various tsunamis in the last 100 years, in accordance with the disaster mitigation agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami will kill more than 200 people and destroy hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The year 1996 will also produce a tsunami in the west of Donggala that will kill us.
Indonesia is finding the belt of focus of the Pacific and it will be able to produce terratrèmols with a certain frequency.
The following is a list of the major landslides and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: On the 26th of December, a great earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of Sumatra, will cause a tsunami that will affect 14 countries and kill 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, most of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes will affect the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Millions of people will die on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake will strike the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and will cause a tsunami that will destroy the southern coast and kill almost 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 is going to shake one of the islands of Mentawai, at the coast of Sumatra, and is going to cause a tsunami of up to 10 metres that is going to destroy dozens of villages and kill hundreds of people.
2016: A strong earthquake will hit Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and will cause destruction and panic, because the population will remember the devastation of the earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami is going to be produced, but more than 100 people are going to die because of the buildings that are going to collapse.
2018: They are going to produce a series of great landslides on the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia that are going to kill more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The demolition will destroy thousands of buildings and leave thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of the ex-governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, born in Wasilla, Alaska, will be arrested for domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Troopers report released Saturday.
According to the police information, when a known person tries to trick the police to denounce the presumed crimes, she will stretch the phone.
Palin has been taken into custody at the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Detention Center, where he is being held without bail on a $500,000 surety bond, according to KTUU.
You will go to court on Saturday, when you will be declared "not guilty, with security" when you will be asked what you were declaring, according to this channel.
Palin committed three faults of class A, which means that she could go to prison for a year and a half and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He was also accused of a lack of class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of 2,000 USD.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
At the end of 2017, Todd Palin will be accused of assaulting his father.
Sarah Palin is going to trick the police to notify the presumed attack.
Right now, the case is in the court of veterans in Alaska.
In 2016, he will be accused of domestic violence, interference with the information of a domestic violence case and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
His wife will declare that she had given him a slap in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin will be criticized by groups of veterans for associating the violent behavior of her son with post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Terratrèmol and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
A total of 384 people have died after a landslide on the Indonesian island of Celebes on Thursday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake has caused a tsunami and has destroyed millions of dollars.
The electricity and the communication networks do not work and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the coastal area of Celebes Central, in the north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
The social networks are circulating videos of the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami was about to hit the coast.
Catalan authorities demand death penalty for suspect in New York attack
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is allegedly going to use a Home Depot truck to carry out an attack in a bike lane on the West Side Highway, Lower Manhattan and cyclists, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov is going to kill the eight victims "intentionally" and that "intentionally" he is going to cause grievous bodily harm, in accordance with the advice of the district attorney of the Southern District of New York.
Crimes against humanity may be punished by death, according to the document of the tribunal.
After the attack, a federal grand jury is going to indict Saipov with 22 counts, including 9 counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which the federal prosecutors can use in cases of organized crime, in addition to a count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The tax authorities have affirmed that the attack will require a "considerable planning and premeditation" and they will describe the way of acting of Saipov as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused terror, death and injury to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
The victims were all tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last execution in the southern district of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, will be sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of two drug dealers, but will be sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs will be electrocuted on June 19, 1953.
According to the documents of the court, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, will not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police will explain that they will affirm to the investigators that they felt bad for what they had done.
In agreement with the indictment, Saipov will explain to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his cell phone.
According to the police, they will also ask that the flag of ISIS be displayed in the room of the hospital.
He has been found not guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represented Saipov, is going to say that it is "obvious" that the decision of the prosecution was "wrong".
“Consider that the decision to request the death penalty, in lieu of accepting a declaration of guilt and a life sentence without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton will say.
Saipov's defense team had previously requested that the death penalty not be sought.
Member of the Conservative Party says Nigel Farage will have to resign as Brexit negotiator
Nigel Farage is going to promise to mobilise "the popular tropes" today during the conference of the conservative party.
The leader of the UKIP has said that the politicians have to "feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics" when one of the members of the parliament of Theresa May has suggested that he would lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP Peter Bone will tell the people of Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be out of the EU if Nigel Farage was the Secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenge facing the lady May at the hour of conciliating her ranks deeply divided has been highlighted when the conservatives in favor of the union have presented in another protest against the Brexit in the City of London.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep her Chequers plan intact between the attacks of the Brexit Party, the Brexit Party and the EU.
The Catalans insist that they will achieve an agreement with Brussels despite the negative answers and the pressure from the Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and the chaos.
The Lord Bone will tell the meeting in Solihull that Chequers is dead.
You are suggesting that Lord Farage has been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he has been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If I had been there, I would have been out already.
The Member of Parliament for Wellingborough will say: "I will defend Brexit, but we need to deliver on Chequers".
In order to express our opposition to the EU, we are going to add: "We will not fight world wars to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
The Lord Bone will disregard the suggestions that say that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has changed its mentality and wants to leave the EU is completely false".
The conservative party of the Brexit Andrea Jenkyns will also be present at the march and will affirm in front of the reporters: "Only the prime minister can decide".
The compromise of Chequers is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular among our party and our activists, who are the people who support the street and advise us to hold elections.
Abandoned the compromise of Chequers and started to escort.
In a message directed to Mrs. May, you will add: "The first ministers maintain their line when they maintain their promises".
The Lord Farage will say that the politicians of the meeting have to feel the pressure if they want to bring the decision taken in the referendum of 2016.
This is a question of confidence between us (the people) and our political class.
“We are here to tell you that we will not allow you to betray the Brexit.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he will add: "I want to say to the political class, at the risk of betraying the Brexit, I feel the pressure".
We are mobilizing the popular tropes of this country that will give us the victory with the Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent Kingdom, autonomous and proud.
The Catalan parties are going to have a meeting in Birmingham before celebrating a meeting of two hours at the centre of the city.
A small number of activists were waving banners against the conservatives after the launch of the group last week.
The conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis is going to resign from the conservative party because of the security problems that the party is facing.
These are the people who tell us that they can have the systems we need and all the technology to make an agreement with Canada plus more, for the border without friction, for free trade with Ireland without borders.
It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a Brexit without Catalonia
Warren has said she is considering a run for the presidency
The US Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said that she will examine the possibility of running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Democrat of Massachusetts will speak about her future in an open meeting to the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's running mate in Massachusetts in the 2016 election.
It has been speculated that Trump will run for president in 2020.
The event of late Saturday in Holyoke will be his 36th meeting with constituents with the format of an open meeting.
An assistant will ask if she had planned to present herself as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren will answer that it's time that "the vagina of Washington repairs our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the cabinet."
A person arrested for the murder of Sims, from LSU
The Baton Rouge Police Department will announce Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at the press conference at 11:00.
Publish a video of the shooting on Thursday and ask for help to identify the shooter.
Sims, 20 years old, is going to shoot himself and he is going to die in front of the Southern University campus in the morning of Friday.
“Wayde Sims is going to get another shot at him, finally, and he’s going to kill him,” said the police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday during the broadcast of the game by 247sports.
Wayde is going to try to defend his friend and he is going to break a leg of Simpson.
Simpson will be interrogated and will admit having been at the scene, in possession of a weapon, and having shot Wayde Sims.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton secures the title of the world after the orders of the team gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment when Valtteri Bottas is going to be ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it will be clear that the orders of the Mercedes team have a big impact on the race.
From the pole position, Bottas will hold a good start and almost exhaust Hamilton while defending his position on the first two turns and inviting Vettel to attack his company.
Sebastian Vettel is going to come into the pits and let Lewis Hamilton pass, which would have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes will have to stop in the pits and will come out behind Vettel, but Hamilton will advance ahead of the Ferrari driver with a move that will cause the driver of the Ferrari to abandon the inside lane with the risk of ending up outside after a double move.
Max Verstappen will start at the back of the grid and at the end of the first lap he will be in the 21st position.
After that, he will continue in a good position for the rest of the race, as he will keep his tyres in good condition, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and pass him to the fourth position.
Finally, he will enter the boxes at number 44, but he will not be able to increase the rhythm at the next eight laps and Raikkonen will be in fourth position.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri is going to do a fantastic job throughout the whole week and he's going to be a true gentleman who deserves all the praise he gets.
The team has done a fantastic job today
His body language will be terrible
President Donald Trump is going to rip into Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for refusing to release the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In a meeting at the Western White House, the president is not going to talk directly about the testimony of Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he will comment that the fact that Ford was appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee demonstrated that the people are "dolent, cruel, and mendacious."
“One thing that could pass through the most innocent of those who are passing through the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see pain, cruelty and lying.”
When you read the messages and the filters and you say "No, I wasn't there."
No he estat jo.
Recorded?
Dianne Feinstein, are you filtering?
Recorded your response... Do you want to filter the document?
No, no.
No I can't filter it."
Wait a minute.
Vam filtrar... No, no el vam filtrar.", va afegir mentre imitava la senadora.
Feinstein will re-release the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July, but she will deny that the leak came from her office.
“I did not believe Dr. Ford’s testimony, I did not believe her story,” Feinstein will tell the committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and I will keep it confidential.
However, his denial will not please the President, who will comment at the meeting of Saturday night: "Know what? His body language will be terrible.
Maybe I won't do it, but it's the best language I've ever seen.
Continuing with his defense of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of inadequate sexual conduct with three women, the president is going to suggest that the Democrats are using their own statements for their own purposes.
They have decided to use the necessary means.
I don't care about cruelty, I don't care about violence, I don't care about who gets hurt, I only care about power and control", said the President, as reported by Mediaite.

An analyst composed a chronology of the night that is going to burn a woman alive
The prosecutor will close the case on Saturday in the revision of the court of a man accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in the year 2014.
The analyst of the Justice Department Paul Rowlett is going to testify during hours as a witness of the analysis of intelligence.
Please describe how you used the cell phone records to build the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett is going to say that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicts his earlier statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
If the data shows that your mobile phone was with you at the time in question when you said you were with your friend Michael Sanford, the police are going to talk to him.
Saturday, Sanford will testify that he was not in the city on that day.
When the tax officials ask if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the truck with Sanford that night, Sanford will say that he had lied, because his truck was in Nashville.
Another incoherence will be that Tellis will say that he knew two weeks that Chambers was going to die.
The telephony registers show that only one week has passed.
Rowlett is going to say that, some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis is going to suppress the messages of text, the tricks and the contact information of Chambers from his phone.
He's going to take it out of his life.
The defense will begin its final arguments on Monday.
The judge is going to say that he expected the trial to be finished by the end of the day.

Another black person?!
A woman from New York asked for a pair of shoes after receiving a message "racist"
A woman from New York City has filed a complaint against a man after he sent her a text message saying "there's another black person here."
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, will express consternation to see that the new manager, Giselle Maurice, is black when she arrives to work on the first day of the year 2016.
 "NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON", writes the lady Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But, in the place of sending it to her husband, she sends it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After having a bad experience with the maid, a "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman is going to meet Mrs. Maurice, saying that the maid she had hired, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she was expecting a Filipino maid, in agreement with the New York Post.
The lady Maurice is going to pay the amount corresponding to her day of birth and, after that, she is going to send it home with an Uber.
Maurice demands compensation for the inconvenience and asks for a compensation of, approximately, 350 USD per day for the work he had to do during his stay of four months for the contract he had not signed.
“I’m going to show them that they can’t do things like that,” he explained to the Post on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple has responded to the declarations that they are racists by affirming that the acceptance of Maurice was the most reasonable, since they could not trust her after having offered her a job.
My wife is going to send me something that she didn't want to say.
It's not racist.
I am not a racist
But, leaving your children in the hands of someone you have never met before, even if it is a mistake?
A baby?
Vinga.
Plasco, who has compared the demand with an "extortion", is going to say that she has two months to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
I'm going to pursue something like that?
It is not a very nice attitude
The legal case is not yet resolved and the public opinion has already condemned the decision of the xarxes socialists and condemned their logic.
The editors of Paddington Bear think that the readers don't have to identify with a bear that speaks, in agreement with a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who is going to publish the book in a few days, will say in the interview: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who is going to publish for the first time."
It's very nice, but we already know what happened to Paddington."
You will explain that your father, who had worked with the camera for the BBC before writing the children's book about a little mouse, was optimistic about the future of the book. You will also say that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books will be "sweet", after your father's death last year.
Describe Paddington as a very important member of his family and that his father was very proud of him.
He was a quiet man; he wasn't a presumptuous one.
“But, how could Paddington be so real for her, it’s almost like when your child asks you for something: you’re proud, even if it’s not a good thing.
I think she thought that was the way out of Paddington.
Paddington always recognized the value of his own creation and his own imagination.
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her goodbye over the phone
When they landed, they took the girl to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors were working to save her life.
“I often told them that it was very difficult and that I didn’t think I would be able to do it” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“I’ve had enough of this shit. I’m going to die in the next two minutes and I’m going to say goodbye.”
I have done it.
I went there: "Tashi, I love you so much.
I will fly with you.
Aniré with you.
The medicines that have been given to you so that you can continue breathing and eating have been consumed and have been excreted from your system.
She had died before the one who was supposed to be there, and so it went out.
There was only one thing to do, and that was to wait and see what would happen.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I've got to keep in good shape."
Finally, the lady Ednan-Laperouse, who has just lost her daughter, is going to board the plane with the rest of the passengers, distressed by the experience she has just been through.
No one knew
He had the cap on his head and the tears in his eyes.
It's difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad the parachutist.
The sensation that I needed from my love and my understanding.
I know that I want a lot.
Dones de dol pengen targetes per impedir els suïcidis a un pont
Dues dones que han perdut persones estimades que s'han suïcidat estan treballant per evitar que altres persones ho facin.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been targeted with phone calls and numbers to call for assistance.
The son of the lady Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started to suffer from a depression and, at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
I don't want to feel what I have to feel every day.
The lady Davis, 45 years old, with residence in Lydney, will say that her son was a promising young man with a contagious smile.
 "We know each other's secrets."
As long as his shadow could illuminate any room.
Tanmateix, you will abandon your feina before you die because you are in a "punt molt fosc."
The year 2014, Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, found out that he had his own life.
Mrs. Davis is going to say: "I'm always concerned about the collateral effect."
The lady Davis is going to create the targets "so that the people can know that there are people to whom they can go to, that they can listen to, even if it is about a friend.
Do not be silent: you must speak.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, is going to lose Mark, her company for 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
“I’m not going to say that I wasn’t depressed or that I wasn’t feeling down.”
Two days before Nadal's birthday, we will see a change in attitude.
When the children go to open their presents on Christmas Day, they won't look at the adults or the other presents.
They say that his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to work: "Open a wound in the family."
He was killed.
But we have to continue and play.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs by a thread as the FBI begins an investigation
I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and a limited time), we could achieve some kind of unity.
Why didn't the Lord want Kavanaugh and the Republicans to have an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to do with the moment.
Only five days are left until the elections of the 6th of November. If, as expected, the Republicans do not obtain good results, they will be weakened at the time of trying to achieve that the citizen who wants to be elected arrives at the main court of the country.
George W. Bush has been using the phone to trick the senators and pressure them to vote for Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for the senator Bush. He also knows the senator's wife, Ashley, through the senator Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, now, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear if the senator Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The name of deserters from North Korea "cau" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un came to power, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that 1,127 deserters were reported in 2012, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
The Lord Park will say that the strict controls on the border between North Korea and China and the increase in the cost of traffickers of people have been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made a public comment.
Normally, the majority of desertors from the North are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The fonts of Seül affirm that more than 30.000 north-coreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the war of Korea in 1953.
The majority escape through Xina, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Xina considers the deserters migrants illegal, in place of refugees and sometimes they have to be repatriated by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which technically are still at war, have improved considerably in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries are going to meet in Pyongyang in order to continue the negotiations on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
This will happen after the historic meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they will agree in general terms to work to achieve a nuclear-free peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, will blame the sanctions of the United States for the lack of progress in the denuclearization process.
“With confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally,” said the senator Ri in a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi said that Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical figure" and that he is not fit to work at the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority of the Cambra Nancy Pelosi is going to say that the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historical" and that his temperament does not allow him to work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi will make these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I don’t want to think that if a woman had acted like this, she would have said that it was a “historical” case,” Pelosi said in relation to the testimony of Kavanaugh’s before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, emotional, will deny the accusations of having sexually abused the doctor Christine Blasey Ford when they were adolescents.
During his initial declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times crying and without words while talking about his family and his years at the institute.
We will also condemn explicitly the democrats of the committee and we will say that the accusations against them are grotesque and coordinated by a person organized by the liberals because Hillary Clinton is going to lose the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi is going to say that the testimony of Kavanaugh showed that he could not work at the Supreme Court, since it showed his prejudices against Democrats.
“I think it’s disgraceful that she’s trying to disqualify him at this stage and the way she’s attacking the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi will show reticence when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats advise the House to impeach Kavanaugh.
This is what I can say: if he did not tell the truth to the Congress or to the FBI, he is not capable of being at the Superior Court, but he is not capable of being at the Supreme Court either.
Currently, Kavanaugh serves as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi will add that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could take against the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
He will avoid answering questions about the annulment of certain decisions of the Superior Court.
“This is not the moment for a person with a history of prejudice and bias to enter the Supreme Court and expect us to marvel at her,” Pelosi said.
The women have to exercise their power.
It's a justifiable diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and I can't help but cry.
“I cry because I have no shoes, until I meet a man who has no feet.”
“I don’t think it will continue like this. And you?”
She's going to continue... "She's going to help a lot of women who were executives in some place that she's going to say that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started to cry, to tell the person she was talking to: "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm annoyed.
After that, he continued.
It seems bright.
The llàgrimes es permeten com a sortida per a la ràbia en part perquè, bàsicament, es malinterpreten.
One of the clearest memories that I have of one of my first female colleagues in an office with a majority of men, one day I ended up crying with rage, it was the one of a director who had always terrified me, who was going to grab me by the throat and throw me down the stairs.
I don't want to see you crying
They don't know you're furious.
Think that you are sad and they will be happy, because they have you.
Patricia Schroeder, who at that time was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In the year 1987, when the Lord Hart is going to be discovered in an extramarital adventure on a boat named Monkey Business and is going to retire from the race, the Lady Schroeder, very frustrated, is going to think that there was no reason to not explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
It will not be a well-considered decision
Yes, there were other candidates for the job and the last thing we needed was another one.
Anyone can say "Blancaneu and the little ones"
As he arrives late to the campaign, he's going to have to recapture the funds, so he's promising that he won't run if he doesn't recapture 2 million USD.
It was a lost battle.
You will discover that some of your party members, who have only 1,000 USD to donate, are only willing to donate 250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?”
She is going to pronounce her speech and she is going to announce that she is not going to start a formal campaign, she is so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who have helped her, frustration with the system because it is difficult to recapture diners and to guide the voters, in place of doing it with the delegates, and the rage, and the sexism) that she is going to remain without words.
“It could have been thought that I was having a nervous breakdown” recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press.
I could have thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put on my tombstone?
“Will you cry?”
The trade war between the US and China could benefit Beijing
The initial salvoes of the trade war between the U.S. and China will be deafening and, as long as it doesn't seem like the war will end soon, a distance between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, will issue his first warning at the beginning of this year, when he will impose tariffs on the main exports of China, such as solar panels, aluminum and steel.
The most significant climb is going to happen this week, with aranzels that will affect products with a value of 200.000 million USD. These aranzels suppose an imposition of taxes on all the goods that arrive from China.
Beijing has countered every time in the same way and recently it has asked for 60.000 millions USD of American bens.
Xina has promised to replicate the U.S. and it is not likely that the second largest economy in the world will be made again in the near future.
If Washington continues to behave in the same way in front of some of the requests, but to incline publicly in front of the EU would be very embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
The experts say that, if Beijing plays its cards well, the trade war with the U.S. could benefit China in the long term by reducing its dependence on the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would start a downward spiral in any of these countries is much more perilous than the testimonies we have heard so far,” says Abigail Grace, an associate fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of the refugees, according to the Minister of External Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the return of the refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than five years.
Before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem will say that the conditions in the country are improving.
At the moment, the situation on the street is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists are going to destroy in order to restore normality.
It is very complicated all the conditions for the return of all the refugees to the country that will have to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that will affect their livelihoods and the maintenance of their families.
The EU calculates that more than 5.5 million people have fled the country since the beginning of the war in the year 2011.
There are also millions of people who come to the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem is going to say that the Syrian regime needs all the help it can get to rebuild the country.
However, I will highlight that I will not accept conditional aid nor the aid of the countries that will finance the insurgency.
The European Ryder Cup team advises victory in Paris
The European Ryder Cup team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, near Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost two Ryder Cups in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup on European soil since 1993.
The European team is going to win the crown again when Thomas Bjorn's team arrives at the 14.5 points necessary to win the United States.
The Northern American star Phil Mickelson, who is going to play during the major part of the tournament, is going to hit the ball into the water on the 16th hole, which is going to give the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Francesco Molinari will shine in all his series and he will convert into one of the four players who have achieved the 5-0-0 in the current format of the tournament since the 1979 season.
The American Jordan Spieth is going to be apart with a 5&4 with the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The most qualified player in the world, Dustin Johnson, is going to lose 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter, from England, who could have played the last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with seven Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, is going to be the major winner that the tournament has had the most, with 25.5 points.
I can't stop crying, but I can't avoid it.
It has been a very hard year.
Thanks, Thomas, for trialing me and creating in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy to have recovered the cup.
The team is the most important... I am very happy to have been able to help.
Pass the ball to your compatriot John Ram, who is going to beat the legend of the American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
I am incredibly proud to have helped Tiger Woods, I grew up following him.
Woods is going to lose the four matches he had in France and he has a record of 13-3-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A statistical anomaly for one of the best players who has ever existed, with 14 Grand Slam titles and only one behind Jack Nicklaus.
The North American team is going to play all week to try to win the Ryder Cup, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who are going to play high-level golf all week.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, is going to talk about the frustrating result of his team: "I am proud of these players, they have fought."
This morning has been a moment in which we have pressured the European selection.
We are in agreement.
I'm going to the bar with Thomas.
It's a great capità.
The 12 players have played very well.
We will regroup, we will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will progress.
I am proud of these 12 players and I am proud to have been their captain.
There is no more than the barret.
They have been defeated.
Actualization of the red tide: the concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in certain parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there have been more widespread conditions of proliferation in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which suggests a lower concentration.
The proliferation of the red tide has extended approximately 200 km from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
They can be found at a distance of 16 km from the county of Hillsborough, but in other places, in comparison with the situation of the last week.
The red tide has also been observed in the county of Pasco.
The National Weather Service in Tampa Bay has issued a Flood Watch for portions of the Tampa Bay area, including Hillsborough, Manatee, Charlotte, and Lee counties. 
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No s'ha notificat cap irritació respiratòria al llarg de la setmana passada al nord-est de Florida.
