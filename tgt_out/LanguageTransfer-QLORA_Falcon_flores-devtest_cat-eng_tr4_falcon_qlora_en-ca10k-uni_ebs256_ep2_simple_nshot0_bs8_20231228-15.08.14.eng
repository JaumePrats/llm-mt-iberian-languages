The researchers will observe the formation of crystals in the urine of cats using the addition of melamine and cyanuric acid.
The composition of these crystals coincides with that of the crystals found in the urine of animals affected by companyia, when comparing them using FTIR spectroscopy.

The witness is under the custody of the prosecutor and the judge, but any witness could be rebutted because his image has been published to the whole world.
This is a common practice in any other part of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
The professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said that "journalists seem to be walking on a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of the suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecutions, has indicated that it will not make any further statements, at least until the sentence.

A publicació d'un estudi de la revista Science descrivaix la formació d'una nova espècie d'ocell a les illes equatorianes de Galápagos.
Researchers from Princeton University and the University of Uppsala in Sweden have informed that the new species has evolved only in two generations, although it was thought that it took much more time for this process, because of the increase in the population of the Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortis (endemic), and the Galapagos finches, Geospiza conirostris (foreigner).
Catalan can work in all forms. It can be moulded in figures of smaller size.
It can be inserted in the primary files, which can be rolled up. It can be flattened or rolled up in the rolls.
It is possible to make a lot of them and to pile them on other metals. It is possible to make them so that sometimes they are piled up to decorate the images painted on books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is the pH of a substance. You can make an indicator using this col.
The sugar of the colombarda grape changes color according to the acidity or basicity (alkaline) of the wine.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (H of pH) in the substance to be analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons, which are the ones that have been lost by the electrons (since the hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two poles and then, with the wet hands, make a ball.
The catalan society reacts with the external caps, which provokes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.

When you find a person who is found at a distance of thousands of kilometers, you are using a satellite.
The satellite is reflected in the space and then reflected in the mirror, almost instantly.
The satellite will be sent to the space for a while. The scientists use telescopes in the space because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of our light and our vision.

There are more cats than dogs in Catalonia, from the smallest to the largest, from the cat to the lion.
Finally, there are many small mammals (including the domestic cats) that feed on the small prey that are more abundant, such as small insects, rosegadors, llangardaixos and birds.
The secret of his exit is the concept of nínxol, a special work that each one has and that prevents them from competing with the others.
The lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
The manades are formed by three adult males related to each other and to the females and calves.
The females are very close, forming a great family of Germans and daughters.
The bands of lions are composed in a great measure of the same way as the bands of leopards or the bands of wolves, which are animals with a very surprising behavior, similar to that of the lions (although not to the other great felines) and also mortal for the prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (all and if it is not very high), jump, jump and run with 5 times the force of a human being.
The tiger is of the same group (genre panther) of the lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the roar of the lion, but more like a cry of pain.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they hunt mice, snakes, lizards and rats. They like to hunt animals that are smaller than them.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the animals that they hunt (prey) with the smell, leaving the tracks that they leave on the ground.
You can see very well the owls at night, and they can also die in a very silent way. The ocelots hunt their prey camouflaging themselves with the environment until they can get away with their prey.
When a small group of people (a small population) is separated from the main group (for example, by creating a forest or a river, or by emigrating to a new island and not being able to return) they will find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations different from those needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not been affected by the virus, and they continue to require the same adaptations as before.
With time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after thousands of years and millions of years, the two populations were so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
I call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce food from the soil using photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and with things made with plants. The majority of what we eat is plant-based. Without plants, most animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, for which it had no other prey, except for other Mosasaurs.
The mandibles of the Catalan ant were longer than the mandibles of the European ant, and had more than 70 teeth, and were accompanied by an additional game, so that there was no way to escape from the path of the Catalan ant.
I don't know about all that, but I think it had a bifurcated language. Her diet included tortugues, big fishes, other mosasaures, and it could be that you were a cannibal.
He also attacked anyone who entered the water; not even a giant dinosaur could compete with a T. rex.
The majority of the Catalan food is familiar, but the Romans had some rare products or unusual ones in their banquets; among them, the swan, the peacock, the caragol and the rosegador, which were called lirons.
Another difference was that, while the poor and the women were given the means to live in a certain way, the men were allowed to participate in banquets and to get drunk while they were eating.
Catalan: 
For example, they didn't have bread, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and the Catalan will try to eat a sandwich in a French restaurant.
Catalan: 
The Catalan people sacrifice to the gods and the priests try to cover the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a patio or a cloister and a sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes they build special pyramids in the shape of towers, called zigurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special place for the gods.
In the cold climate of the Orient, the habitat was not so important.
The majority of the life of the Jewish family took place in the open air.
Women are in the kitchen; the shops were simple openers that watched the street. We used the stone to build houses.

If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may imagine that at the end of the Declaration of Independence there is a map of the treasure.
Yes, it's true. But it's not a map of the treasure.
The Catalan text of the Declaration of Independence is found at the bottom of the document, under the heading "Declaració d'Independència original amb data 4 de juliol de 1776".
And that no one knows who is going to write, we know that the first sheet of paper (29¾ x 24½ inches) is going to be rolled up to be stored.
So, it seems that the notation is going to be added simply as a label.
The landings of the day D and the battles that will come after will free the north of France, but the south is still not free.
Catalonia was governed by France "de Vichy". It was about Frenchmen who signed the pact with Germany in 1940 and who were going to collaborate with the invaders in the front.
The Catalan Air Force will be based in the south of France on August 15, 1940, the invasion will be called "Operation Dragon".
In only two weeks, the Americans and the French forces liberated the south of France and advanced towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a group of important people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilitas, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or state, and it also defines in some way the dimensions of the society.
The city-states precede the nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural practice and an equitable diffusion.
Catalan minorities sometimes disappear without leaving any historical traces and are not recognized as civilisations in their own right.
During the War of Independence, the three states formed a weak central government, the Congress, which was the only component of the Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and, as there was no executive or judicial authority in Catalonia, the Catalan government had to rely on the authorities of the State, which were often few cooperatives, to enforce all its acts.
Catalonia did not have the authority to invalidate the tax laws and the treaties between states.
The Articles need unanimous approval by all the states before they can be put into effect. The states are so often absent that the representatives of the central government sometimes have to stay away.
The national football team of Italy, with the national football team of Germany, is the second team with more world cups and will be the champions of the FIFA World Cup 2006.
The most known sports are football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
The most popular esports in the north regions are the winter ones, and they count with the presence of Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan counts with 7.000 islands (Honshu is the largest), which makes it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the group of children that has the Japanese, sometimes we call it, in geographical terms, an "archipelago"
The first contacts between Catalonia and Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when the European sailors who passed by the island for the first time called it Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company will establish a base in the south-east of Taiwan, and will start the transformation of indigenous practices of production and will recruit Chinese workers for the plantations of rice and sugar.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) takes control of the coastal areas of the west and north of Taiwan, and declares Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the House of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings in the complex have been reconstructed to give the tourists a better idea of how they were originally built.
In 1976 the Machu Picchu had been restored 30% and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common format of film is 35 mm, which was the standard size of the film during the era of the analog films.
It is produced today, but it is still more important: the relationship between the image and the sensor has changed in the digital image sensors.
The 35 mm format creates, in fact, a little confusion, with 36 mm of extension and 24 mm of height.
It is said that the relation of aspect of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the relation of simpler numbers) is, in any case, of 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal or very similar to this relation of aspect.
The rule of thirds, which has been used and sometimes ridiculed, is a guideline that creates dynamism and order in an image.
The most efficient place for the subject is the intersection between the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example).
During this period the European history is going to pose the question of the Catholic Church, which has been rich and powerful.
During more than a thousand years, the Christian religion is going to unite the European states, despite the differences of language and customs.
His power was omnipresent, affecting kings and plebeians.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the Church's financial resources should exist precisely for this purpose.
The main authority of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and wealth would mean that many people would be asking if this dogma was being complied with.
Shortly after the start of the hostilities, Brittany began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy will prove to be effective, taking into account the vital ministries of military and civilians, even though this blockade violated international laws that have been generally accepted by various international agreements in the last two centuries.
Catalonia will mine the international waters to avoid that any vessel can enter in complete segments of the sea, putting in danger the neutral vessels.
There was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine warfare without restrictions.
During the years 1920s, the prevalent attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and non-intervention.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations want to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla is going to move to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company of New York.
We will arrive to the United States with four hundred books, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the last book of the series that will be published in the next issue) for Thomas Edison.
The old Xina had a unique way of showing different historical epochs: each stage of the Xina or of each family in power was a dynasty.
There was also a period of instability in the dynasties. The most known of these periods is the 3 Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were fierce wars between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most bloody periods of the ancient China, thousands of people were going to die fighting for the control of the capital Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single governor.
Just after the Revolution, the occupations will be opened to all the men who will ask for it, allowing the most ambitious and successful to get it.
This also applies to the military, because instead of basing the military institutions in classes, from now on they will be based in the relevance.
The French Revolution will also inspire many other people from the working class repressed in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mahoma is deeply interested in assumptions that go beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that would be known as "Hira" to the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, gives a very clear image of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the top of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, the cave is completely filled with the rest of the world.
Yes, and all that, but it's not easy to find. The cave is absolutely the only place where you can find them.
There is no way to see the sea from the cave and the beautiful mountains that surround it. There is very little of this world that I can see or feel from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists.
Built by the Egyptians during the IIIrd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many great pyramids built to honour the Pharaoh.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh, or "Necropolis of Gizeh", is a pyramid in the Egyptian city of Giza. It is the largest pyramid in the world, and the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid is going to be built in honour of the Pharaoh Kheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples are going to be built in honour of the exhibits and the members of the family of the Pharaoh.
The signal "d'arc cap amunt" is assembled to the letter V (the lower case) and the "d'arc cap avall" seems like a grap or a square without the lower side.
When the amount of the arrow is big, it means that I have to start from the tip and start the arc in the direction of the ascendant, and when it is small, it means that I have to start from the taló (which is the base of the arrow) and stretch the arrow in the direction of the descending.
Pulling the strings from right to left generates a more sour sound, while pulling them from left to right produces a more assertive sound.
Take the freedom to note your own indications, but keep in mind that the marks of the arc are for a musical reason, so they have to be respected.
The frightful King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two little children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the German of the King, Madame Elisabeth, are forced to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a cart, they will go to Paris surrounded by a crowd that cries and shouts threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd will force the king and queen to open all the windows of the carriage completely.
In a certain point, a member of the crowd shows the head of a guard killed in front of the Queen in Versailles.
The expenses of war of the imperialism North-American during the conquest of the Philippines are paid by the own people Filipino.
We will see that the Catalan people will have to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States, so that we can pay for a large part of the expenses and interests of the good loans in the name of the Filipino government through the banks of Wall Street.
For the purpose of comparison, the big profits derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people for a long time constitute the basic elements of the imperialism of the United States.
To understand the Templars, we have to understand the context that promotes the creation of the order.
The period in which the popular events of the Plena Edat Mitjana take place, the period of European history in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (1000 - 1300 dC).
The Middle Age is preceded by the High Middle Age and followed by the Low Middle Age, which ends in the year 1500.
Determinism is a term that in practice has a wide range of ideas, from the technological imperative or the technological imperative to a strict sense that the human being is guided by an occult logic that is associated with the scientific laws and the manifestation of technology.
The majority of the interpretations of the technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, instead of being socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the motorway tolls are necessary for the development of the roads.
The network of railways is not viable economically, so we are developing new methods of production to reduce the cost of having a car.
The possession of large amounts of cards also leads to a greater incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new medical assistance techniques to repair damaged objects.
Romanticism will have an important deterministic cultural component, written by Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romanticism context, geography gave shape to people, and with time, customs and cultures related to that geography appeared, which were better than those imposed arbitrarily, since they were in harmony with the place and with society.
As Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in the feudal Europe.
His fame as an epicentre of luxury is going to start in the year 400 dC and it is going to last until the year 1100 dC.
His status is going to change during the 12th century, especially because the Croats have returned to the city with more valuable goods than the ones that the Byzantines offered.
It will be in this moment when the capital of fashion will go from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style will achieve maximum popularity during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture.
And, because of the slowness of the communication channels, the styles can arrive to the west with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, the Western Europe will start to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the period is that, as a result of the Crusades, the people start to use buttons to button up their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the one that ends up producing food only to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple system, often organic, that uses native reserves of the area combined with other techniques relatively simple to maximize the yield.
Historically, the majority of the pagesos dedicate to subsistence agriculture, and it is so in many countries in the process of development.
Subcultures gather people with similar ideas in order to feel less alone and develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location and gender of its members.
The qualities that determine a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of the factors.
The members of a subculture sometimes distinguish themselves from the others by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashion, customs and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to show the cases of children who are not socialized by adults while growing up, due to negligence, bad luck or intentional abuse.
These children are called "ferals" or "salvatges". Some of them have been adopted by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the difficulty of the parents to cope with the child's intellectual or physical disability.
The children saved can have suffered maltreatment or traumas before being abandoned or fleeing.
Other animals have been created by animals; some say that they have lived in a state of salvation in all the suns.
The infant saved, when it is created only by animals, presents behaviours (always within physical limits) similar to those of the animal that it creates, as the indifference towards the humans.
Even if the learning based on projects would be easier and more interesting, the bastida is one step further.
The theory of the bastida is not a learning method, but an aid that provides the individuals who submit to a new learning experience, as learning to use a new software or starting a new project.
Catalan bastides can be virtuals or real: in another way, a professor is a form of bastida, but also it is the small clip assistant of Microsoft Office.
Virtual bastides are internalized in the programming and are designed to question, show and explain procedures that could have been very complicated to understand for the student because they were not explained in a simple way.
Children are given in foster care for different reasons, from abandonment to abuse, passing through extortion.
There would be no one who would not have to grow up in an environment that is not fed, educated and cared for, but only one who does it.
I think that the system of family reunification is a way of security for these children.
Our system of reception must provide safe, caring, stable and reliable education and health care.
It is supposed that the reception confers all the requirements that are not covered in the house where they are going to take the original.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication with interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet bring about additional dimensions in terms of the focus on uses and gratifications.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal implication and "relations in course" are also identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigate the reaction of the public to web sites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is affirmed that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by interpreting correctly their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, pointed out that people who are not able to hear the king's speech are not necessarily deaf, but they are also not able to evaluate the sincerity of the speech.
I suggest that these capacities of interpretation of the human behavior could be shared by animals like dogs.
In the XX century, research has shown that there are two genetic variants: exposed and protected.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection eliminates the combination of genetic variations that expresses the patrimony of variation.
The segregation and recombination combine the variation of the past and the present between the two genetic patrimonies in each generation.
At the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human one to satisfy its needs of amino acids with the available resources of plants.
In addition, it has serious consequences: malnutrition, stunting and finally death.
The most easy to obtain resources are the vegetals, but they have to be cooked, which is difficult for us humans.
In the case of animal origin food (honey, beeswax, ous), they are digested easily, but they also contain a great quantity of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not be surprised by this, because our ancestors have already solved the problem of proteins, as we can see in the case of the ximpanzés of the savannah.
The interruption of the sound is the process of taking a break during the normal period of sound and returning to sleep at the end of a nap (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do with a clock that wakes you up but not completely.
If you are the ones who restart the washing machine while sleeping, try to put it on the other side of the room, so that you can turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythms include many liquids (especially water or tea, a diuretic) before going to sleep, so that one has to wake up to urinate.
The amount of inner poverty that a person has is correlated inversely to the amount of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the vital force. Each person has the potential to find peace and full satisfaction.
We can all arrive at illumination. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is spread by the path of love of Mahayana and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of the kundaliní yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With the Kundalini Yoga the kundalini energy is awakened (illuminated energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is the yoga of the state of being. By visualizing various states, the channels of energy are activated and the chakras are awakened.
Catalonia was the enemy of the Second World War, which will facilitate the collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice will come the system, processes and cultures, and both countries will be enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the Catalans and the French were enemies and the cold war had begun.
It will prolong the forty years following and it will fight with the delegated exercises, in camps of battle of Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the bridge of Roman.
These plans will become obsolete by the end of the night, when more than 800.000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army will enter and create the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having violated the Treaty of Riga, the Pact of Non-Aggression between Soviet-Polish and other international treaties, bilateral or multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is, with some differences, the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional task of the marines has been to ensure that your country has the capacity to defend itself against the enemy and to protect its people and its goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's capacity to defend itself and to protect its people and its goods.
One of the most recent examples is the Catalan campaign of the Second World War. The United States is trying to move people and materials across the Atlantic to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Catalans had failed, it is likely that Germany would have conquered Great Britain, as it is going to do with the rest of Europe.
It seems that the goats are domesticated for the first time 10.000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
Catalan cultures and ancient tribes start to domesticate animals by making it easy to get wood, fire, meat and skin.
Domestic goats should be kept in areas that are suitable for grazing, such as pastures or other areas of pasture, sometimes watched by children or adolescents. These methods of grazing are still used today.
The wagons will be built in England in the 16th century.
All the lives consist in only the parallel tracks, the trains with horses to reach the speeds greater and the carriages with more weight in the parts more difficult.
The sleepers were introduced with great force to keep the lives in their place. Thus, the sleepers are seen that the lives would be more efficient if they had a cover of iron over.
This is going to become a habitual practice, but the rails are going to wear out more on the wagons.
Finally, the rods of the fusta are going to be replaced by rods of iron. The first completely iron rods are going to be introduced in the year 1767.
The first transport known to Catalonia was the train, which began to run in 1854, and the people began to walk on two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their passports, the australopitecs, do not walk in a usual way.
They have found bipedal fossils in the Austropithecus of the 4.2-3.9 million years ago, all and that the sahelanthropids could have walked on two legs to stretch 7 million years ago.
We can start to live in a more respectful way with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become activists to reduce the pain that could exist in the future.
This treatment is only effective in the majority of cases. However, if we do not want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem and we have to disable it.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems have increased because of the excess of population and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After the adoption of the Declaration of Independence by the Congress on July 4, 1776, he was sent a copy of the Declaration to the printer, John Dunlap, who was located a few blocks away.
During the night they will print between 150 and 200 copies, which we know today as "Dunlap's Volants".
The first public reading of the document will take place at Independence Hall on July 8th.
If we send a letter to George Washington on July 6, he will read it on July 9 in New York. A copy will arrive in London on August 10.
The 25 copies of Dunlap that are known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original manuscript has not been perused.
Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and that they are alive. In the morning.
Many people don't see us as dinosaurs because we have feathers and can fly.
But there are many birds that assemble to form a dinosaur.
They have a lot of teeth and claws, they put them on the back of the tail and they walk on their own legs like a tyrannosaurus.
Almost all the computers that we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can only have two possible values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called bits, according to the jargon of the informatics.
The internalization of the Catalan language can be a process that is not immediately evident. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general and can not be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator of environmental impact of the winter is the presence of a container for medicines or domestic chemical products toxic.
Instructions on how to use specific auxiliary aids for the specific label.
The term insect is used by entomologists for this group of insects.
This term derives from the antiparentic relation with the xinxes, which are very adapted insects to parasitar humans.
The reduvids and the xinxes are small, adapted to see in the new or in the host's habitat.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the most common neurological disease in young adults and adults.
Catalan: 
The research has concluded that women have twice (2 times more) the probability of suffering from multiple sclerosis than men.
A swimmer can decide that it is not the best option for him to train in a club.
These parallels can choose to adopt a child.
The adoption of a child ends the parental rights of the parents of the child, so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method guides the vast majority of scientific research.
Yes, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a proof used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
The Catalan naturalists and philosophers will centre on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Catalan.
They will accept Aristotelian opinions on all the assumptions of science, including psychology.
As the Greeks' knowledge decreases, the Orient will be disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that are observed in physiology and behavior sometimes depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production using biologically active substances.
The periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in the majority of cases, as in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological oscillators are self-sustained oscillators that follow a period of inertia until they are not influenced by external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase have developed a way to deliver a virus, or a piece of DNA, to implant in a bacterium.
We will carry out two experiments that will mark the DNA of the virus with radium or the protein of the virus with radium.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the material affected by the mutation and whether the affected cells are germinal cells.
Only the mutations in the germinal cell line can be transmitted to the sons, in any other place the mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is based on the natural environment, which attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife.
Among the examples of activities in situ, we can include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks and environmental information centers.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, the people of the rural villages take their bags to the place where they work and leave the place where they have been working to go to the place where they will work.
In this dynamic vehicle, everyone is connected to, and supports, a system of transport based on private coins.
Science shows us today that this colossal economy of carbon has been out of balance for one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has given support to the evolution of man during the last two million years.
Catalan Society participates in the society and uses transport systems. We all complain about the transport systems.
If you are a Catalan, you will probably not feel the same way about the quality of the water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fall down so often? Because the engineers of transport are incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental?
The Flux of Transport is the study of the movement of individual conductors and vehicles between two points and the interactions that are established between them.
Studying the traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict the behaviour of the driver with 100% certainty.
For sorting, the conductors usually behave in a range of considerable constancy; therefore, the flow of transport tends to have a considerable constancy and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To represent better the flow of traffic, relations have been established between the three main characteristics of the city: (1) cabal, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations help to plan, design and operate the railway lines.
Insects are the first animals that will conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from their enemies more easily and to find food and mate more efficiently.
Most of the insects have the advantage of being able to bend the wings of their prey to the point of breaking them.
This provides a great variety of small places where you can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the sphinx and the ephemera.
There are thousands of years, a man named Aristarcus will affirm that the solar system is moving around the Sun.
There was a man who thought that the sun was moving towards the earth, but many people thought the opposite: that the solar system was moving away from the earth, including the sun (and all the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, or is it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the largest river on Earth. It transports 8 times more water than the second longest river.
The Amazones are also the widest river of the Earth, sometimes it is more than a thousand miles wide.
20% of the water that comes from the rivers of the planet is from the Amazon.
The main river Amazones is 6.387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
The construction of pyramids with stone will continue until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the measurement and the technical excellence of the construction of the pyramids of Gizeh will not be surpassed.
The Egyptians of the New Empire were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which had more than 1000 years.
The population of the City of the Vatican is of 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Catalan is also the language of daily use for the majority of people who live in Catalonia, while that the Valencian is used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the City of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
It has a knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, which are found in nature in their natural state and are relatively easy to extract with primitive methods.
Aristotel, a philosopher, proposes that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
The four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, all and what else, according to his theory, convert themselves into new substances that form what we see.
The alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. You don't have to worry about the periodic table having many elements.
The elements of calcium and potassium are considered metals. It is clear that there are other metals such as silver and gold.
Catalan people can also have small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The whole Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of atoms are contained in the final point of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil is going to become a good friend of many people when it is invented.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status.
At the moment, we write messages on the computer screen, without needing a punch.
You can ask what will happen to the keyboard when the new thing comes out.
The fission bomb works with the principle that joins a nucli with many protons and neutrons.
It is similar to the way a heavy cart costs a lot. Separating the knot from this energy.
Some nuclei have unstable isotopes, which means that they tend to break down with a small or no collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and poles. The outer layer of the Moon is called escorça.
The average distance of the route is 70 km in the most proper part and 100 km in the most lunar part.
It is more common under the lunar phases and more abundant in the mountain areas.
It may be that there are more lunar phases visible to the naked eye because the lava is more fluid. It is easier for the lava to come out to the surface.
The theories of content are centered on finding out what pleases or interests the people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and desires that have been internalized so that they mature to adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want to do certain things and what makes them do them or not.
Two famous theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, there are two behaviours that the administrators begin to lead their predecessors. One extreme of the spectrum is to try to follow "a little more" (or "a little more").
This type of manager has problems taking unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary actions, taking a long time to evaluate, assigning responsibilities and making others responsible for their acts.
In the case of the opposite, the individual is transformed into an irrecoverable individual that feels that it has to change everything that has been done by the equipment and make it his.
After all, the leader is the responsible for the exit and the failure of the team.
This behaviour often ends in a picabaralles between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual equipments are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional equipments, but with some small differences.
The members of a virtual group can function as a contact point for their group immediately.
Catalan teams have more autonomy than the teams of the conventional ones, since they can meet according to different time zones that the local direction cannot understand.
The presence of an "invisible" facilitator (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible equipment" is the equipment administrator to which each member addresses. The equipment administrator establishes the standards for each member.
Why would a Catalan organization want to go through a long process of establishing an organization for learning? One of the objectives of putting into practice the concept of learning organization is innovation.
Creativity and innovation can emerge when all the available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization.
As a consequence, the work of a joint organization to overcome a challenge can lead to a process of innovation to respond to the client's need.
To be an innovative organization, the leader has to create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and learning organization.
Angel (2006) explains the approach as a method to help organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data will provide physical proofs for a theoretical focus on cognition research. Therefore, the area of investigation will be much more exact.
The correlation between brain diseases and the behavior of scientists is the basis of the scientific research.
It is very important to know that different types of damage, traumas, lesions and brain tumors can affect the behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The new technologies allow us to see and investigate structures and brain processes earlier.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build models of simulation that will help us to understand processes in our mind.
The fact that the AI has strong connotations of science-fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research in AI implies machines to automatize tasks that require an intelligent behavior.
Examples of control, planning and programming, the capacity to respond to the diagnostic and the client's questions, the recognition of the script, the view and the index.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The Catalan Artificial Intelligence System is used frequently in various economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as it has been built in various domestic and video games applications.
The thematic subjects are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take her students to places that a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution to virtual trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire the beauty of art while they are in class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share the experiences with future students.
For example, each year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to Washington, D.C., each year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept as a record.
Blogs can also help to improve the writing of students. As long as students start blogging with a bad grammar and spelling, this can change with the existence of a public.
As students are often the most critical, the blogger starts to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogs "force" students to be more astute with the world that surrounds them. The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be more curious and attentive (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and expands the learning beyond the traditional school day.
The use of blogs can help students to be more analytical and critical; they can define their own positions in the context of the texts they write and also highlight their own perspectives on specific issues in a concrete way (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting bilingual capital of Canada and it counts with a series of art galleries and museums that show the past and present of Canada.
To the south there are the Niagara Falls and to the north the natural beauty of Muskoka and more in the north.
These are all the elements, among others, that make Ontario a city of excellence.
The population of the large extensions of the north is less dense, and some zones are still uninhabited.
For a comparison of populations that are usually surprising: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Catalans.
The Islands of the Eastern Africa are found in the Eastern Coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the most different, and a continent in itself, in terms of life.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs will also bring Islam to the lands, and will take a great path to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism start in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama finds the route to India.
Catalonia is located in the north of the Mediterranean Sea, and in the south of the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who is married, regardless of her civil status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (one that does not look like that).
Women have to admit that cultural differences can cause them to be considered as "different", and not as "equal".
The men are not going to defend the position (with or without cultural differences, it doesn't matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca will be founded by Catalan fishermen in the 10th century and will be used as a strategic port by the Romans, the Visigoths and the Berbers, who will name it Anfa.
The Portuguese are going to destroy it and they are going to build it under the name of White House, only to abandon it after a terratrèmol in 1755.
The Sultan of Marrakech is going to rebuild the city with the name of Daru l-Badya, the name of Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting places to visit in Morocco.
The old Medina can be easily found by the tourists, who can find there a wide range of Moroccan traditional products, such as tajins, terrissa, objects of pell, narguils, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is not thought for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the extreme east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma will be destroyed by the lava of Nyiragongo, which will bury the majority of the streets of the city, especially the center.
If Goma is as safe as it is claimed, it would be wise to investigate before any visit to this city to assess the state of the conflict in the province of Kivu Nord.
The city is also the base to climb Nyiragongo and to some of the gorillas of the mountain more economical in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycles) to go to Goma. The normal price (local) is 500 Congolese francs for the trip.
Combining with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" has ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic lands, lunyanes.
Today, Tombouctou is a poor city, totally, and it is known as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it will be included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of the sand dunes.
It will be one of the main parades during the special program "African Miracles" by Henry Louis Gates for PBS.
The city is found in a strong contrast with the rest of the cities of the country because it has a more Arab air than African.
The Kruger National Park is located in the north-east of South Africa and crosses the border with Mozambique to the east, and with Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the border to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecozones, each one with a different fauna.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the reference of the national parks of South Africa (SANParks).
All the national parks in South Africa have a daily entrance fee.
You can also benefit from buying a Wild Card, which allows you to enter a selection of parks in South Africa, all the National Parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the main island of Hong Kong and is the place that most tourists consider the main center.
The buildings that make up the urban silhouette of Hong Kong have been related to a graphic of bars that is evident with the presence of the Victoria Harbour's aiguas.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, I abandoned the island and went to the other side of the Kowloon Bay promenade.
The vast majority of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is located in the coastal area of the north.
This is the place where the British colonists will settle, so, it is a good starting point if you want to know the past colonial past of the territory.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, covering 10,000 km2 (3,860 mi2) in Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only swamps of mangroves, but also include some of the last remaining power-forests that once covered the plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3.850 km², of which 1.000 km² are covered by water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for the life of the Bengal tiger and it is estimated that there are 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Asiatic lions in the area.
The buses from the interurban bus station (on the other side of the river) run all day long, every day, but especially the ones that go to Jakar/Bumthang, which leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
As the buses between districts sometimes get full, it is recommended to buy a ticket with some days of advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to move around the city, like Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock Bridge is a bridge that attracts. It is located at the end of the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock with the Guiana French.
The two towers have a height of 83 metres, a length of 378 metres and two tracks of 3.50 metres wide.
The open space under the bridge is 15 metres high. The construction will be finished in August 2011, but it will not be possible to cross it until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be fully functional in September 2017, when the Brazilian dams are expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group that inhabited the Paraguay Oriental, and they lived as nomadic hunters, but they also practiced agriculture for subsistence.
The Chaco region was the home of other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived hunting, gathering and fishing.
The Paraguay, formerly known as "Province of the Giants of the Indies", will be created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
The Catalans will start the period of colonization that will last three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to keep a great part of its character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important polo tournament of this sport takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here you can also see smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments or to buy the tickets for the polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Balearic Islands is the Euro (EUR), with a value equivalent to a British pound (GBP).
The dinners can be enjoyed in the only restaurant on the islands, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West shop.
Generally, the British accept the free movement of people and goods within the EU and also the free movement of capital and currency within the EU.
The islands of the periphery probably will not accept credit cards, although they can accept British and American money; this was proved by the owners who had to decide which method of payment was accepted.
It is impossible to change money from the Balearic Islands to the Canary Islands, so you have to go there.
As Montevideo is found in the south of the Equator, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere is winter, and viceversa.
Montevideo is found in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures are usually over 30 °C.
Winter can be false: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make the sensation colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "wet" or "dry" stations: the amount of rain is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many animals of the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the authorities of the park, the distance between the bones and the animals is 100 and 25 meters, and between the rest of the animals is 25 meters.
For more than it seems, bears, wolves, antelopes, elephants and all the big animals can attack.
Every year, hundreds of visitors are injured because they have not left a sufficient distance. These animals are big, saved and potentially dangerous, so it is advisable to give them their space.
In addition, you should take into account that the odors come from the bones and other animals rescued, so, avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia is founded in 1850 and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port will be the scene of a famous insurrection in 1889, when the ships of Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to abandon it.
All the ships will be sunk, by a British destroyer. In addition, they will lose 200 American and German citizens.
During the Mau's independence movement, a pacific meeting in the city will result in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are abundant, as Auckland is the horse of two ports. The most popular ones are located in three zones.
The beaches of North Shore (in the district of North Harbour) are facing the Pacific Ocean and they are extended from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
Most of them are beaches of sand and they are safe, and most of them have shadow thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are Mission Bay and St Heliers to the south, and Mission Bay and St Heliers to the north.
These are sometimes beaches with a good range of shops along the coast. It is safe.
The most known local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is refreshing and pleasant. The other local beer is "Manta".
You can take many French wines, but the wines of New Zealand and Australia do not tolerate the trips well.
It is the water of the local well, but if you want to drink it, bottled water is easy to find.
For the Australians, the concept of tallat is foreign. A short coffee is a coffee express, the head is well filled with cream (without foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The chocolate melts in the mouth. The fruit juices are very good, but the quality is excellent.
During the whole year there are many trips to the hospital and it is rare that there are serious injuries caused by these causes.
All this, and follow the recommendations of the authorities, respect all the signals and pay special attention to the security alerts.
The nests are found in the banks of rivers and estuaries from October to April. They are also found outside these months.
Bullfighting exists, but rarely attacks humans. The majority of bulls fear humans and become docile.
