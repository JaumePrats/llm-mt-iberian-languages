In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that is generally accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and their three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this bird has a reddish brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or caroteneous color on the lower part.
This discovery also helps us to understand better the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Since the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called raquis, but does have other features of feathers (wings and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raquis is probably the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but to temperature regulation or as an indicator of the same. Researchers maintain that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, although the tail of a young dinosaur is shown, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the Cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take over the post of Minister of Business that Davey leaves vacant.
The 16th of February is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, both 25 years old, died. Alden was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered arm injuries and a broken jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon jammed as he aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, he can only see with one eye, part of his skull is missing and his face was reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via a virtual link from a US Air Force base in his country of origin.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races in addition to the Wednesday competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "Did not finish the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In his other career, the giant slalom, he finished tenth in the women's sitting combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four slalom skiers sitting down did not complete their races and a total of 45 slalom skiers out of 117 in the Giant Slalom did not reach the classification.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh recovered the laptop and the mobile phone stolen.
The Deputy Inspector General, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."

At first, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is under custody awaiting trial, any witness's testimony can be questioned, as her image has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the processing, said it would not make any further comments until the charge sheet is issued.
According to the information that leaked out, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the existing boundaries prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also addressed, according to information received, include the future status of Jerusalem, which both countries consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PA only accepts five.
During the complementary control of pests, the game wardens had to supervise the shooters closely, since they were monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the NSW State Association of Target Shooters, volunteers were recruited who were suitable for the program of hunting within the Association of Target Shooters.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge, provisionally, of the office of Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS Park, noted that comprehensive training was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its Spanish initials) of nine members.
In four years, Martelly is the fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the previous CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures aimed at leading the country to new elections.
The commission was the way in which Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were caused by the fact that elections were not held, in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 iPods have been reported with problems of malfunctioning and overheating, which have caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry said it was "truly regrettable" that Apple had not yet submitted its report.
Mariana was shaken by a 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 h GMT) earthquake on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage on the national territory.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the Philippines, a former police officer kidnapped a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 rifle against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs could be accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that investigators for the government had recovered the flight recorders from the black box.
The comrades who fought alongside Luna also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro en Polvo Runnels said: "Luna is as strange as I am, even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
From 2008, when the survey was conducted before the federal elections of 2010, the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic increased by 8%.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic once the Queen Elizabeth II's term of office had ended.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
In the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; 31% believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle had to swim in the freestyle style in the 100-meter and 200-meter races, and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned after his complaints.
He been unable to take painkillers because they are prohibited during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using various hardware and software and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps cometas have served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists expect to understand how planets, including our own, were formed, given that comets have crashed into the Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He described the rumours as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel a year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast with the old radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and dissuasive measures will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered whether the game could be played behind closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the magazine Science reported on a new species of bird that had appeared in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Experts from Princeton University, aux Etats-Unis, et de l'Université d'Uppsala, en Suède, ont déclaré que la nouvelle espèce avait évolué en deux générations seulement, alors que l'on estimait qu'il faudrait beaucoup plus de temps pour que cela se produise, en raison de la reproduction entre un pinzón de Darwin endémico, Geospiza fortes, et un pinzón de cactus migrante, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It is so thin that it can be adhered to another metal. It is so thin that it was used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "manuscrits illuminés".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will change depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a proton-free hydrogen ion is the result of removing a proton from an electron.
Shake both powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in their hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost all houses with odorless toilets connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the cities of Creta and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had public toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to provide us with a much simpler and faster means of transport.
Thanks to her today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including domestic cats that are independent of their owners) that feed on smaller species that are much more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the big cats that socialize the most and their lives take place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, joined by up to 30 females and their offspring.
Generally, females are very close to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in the same way as wolf packs or dogs, with a surprising similarity to the other great cats (unlike the other big cats, lions are highly lethal to their prey).
The tiger is a full-fledged athlete, with the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, dive, and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a full roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and shouts.
Ocelotes enjoy eating small creatures. In most cases, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Most of their prey will be smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelotes track and find prey (food) by smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and they move very quietly, and they also hunt their prey very stealthily.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they come (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island), they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still needs the same adaptations as in the past.
As the population grows, it begins to resemble less and less the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will not be possible to classify them as belonging to the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an ineludible consequence and a fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
The food of the plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from the plants and also make clothes from them. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth like knives, as well as another group of teeth in the palate, which means that anything that comes in front of him has no escape.
We don't have the security, but it could have been a viperine. Its diet included tortoises, large fish, other mosasaurians and even a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water, even a T. Rex as large as the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
While most of the food we would eat would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that distinguished them was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the wealthy and men enjoyed sharing meals and eating sideways.
It is impossible that the recipes of the ancient Rome included foods that arrived in Europe centuries after they were introduced in America or Asia.
They did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no Roman of antiquity ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
People made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to satisfy the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests can enter.
In other cases, special towers with a pyramidal shape were built, called zigurats, to form part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only display windows that faced the street. Houses were built with stone.
In Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him more westward, discovered the island and gave it his name.
Despite his discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
While each country was Scandinavian, there were significant differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Treasure Island, you may think that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. The back of the document contains something written, but it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has the following written on its reverse: "Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776." The text is written on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known exactly who wrote it, it is known that the document was drafted shortly after the event and rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the notation was added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out on D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, the south still remained.
His government was in the hands of the Frenchmen of "Vichy", who had agreed to peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragon was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that belongs to a large group of people who live and work together; in other words, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and relates both to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, as to civitas, which means city or city state and which, in addition, determines in some way the size of the society.
The state cities are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogeneous dissemination.
Minorities tend to disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilisations.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, initially, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was the only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and since it had executive or judicial powers, the function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to enforce all their laws.
He was not authorized to annul tax laws or customs duties between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval by all states for their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German selection, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan there are about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is usually referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed through the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the establishment of a Dutch East India Company base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the indigenous method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal and western regions of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this last as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings in the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to see how they looked originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and work continues today.
To illustrate, the most common format for fixed-image photography worldwide is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the era of analog film.
Today, this phenomenon still occurs, but the most important thing is that the dimensional relationship has been transferred to the digital image sensors of the cameras.
In fact, the 35 mm format is confusing, because its width is 36 mm and its height is 24 mm.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividir par 12 pour calculer la raison la plus simple de nombres entiers) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g. APS group) are similar or very similar to this relationship.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while also providing some order to the images.
He indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power was everywhere, from the monarch to the common people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be reserved for that specific purpose.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian vital supplies, was successful, this measure violated the generally recognized international right and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted water from international waters in whole sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even putting at risk the ships of neutral countries.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would face a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid a repetition of such situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at Edison in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his last manager) addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between each dynasty, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, when thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, because now the charges are based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed working people to start their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured over time, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
Atop a one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if one is sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains in the vicinity. From the inside of this cave, it is difficult to see or hear anything of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramidal structures built to worship the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The "upward arc" mark resembles a V and the "downward arc" mark resembles a graphe or a square without its lower border.
Above means to start at the tip and push the bow, and below means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, while a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but do not forget that the marks on the archery instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose, and therefore they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife, Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Luis Carlos, 4 years old), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook his head at the execution of a guardia real in front of the queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war costs of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the expenses and interest on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From the outset, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in which these events take place is known as the Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The deterministic technological concept includes, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from the technological imperative to a strict sense of that there is a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and that it is related to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds along a path independent of any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
One could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a vehicle.
The widespread use of automobiles also leads to a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography moulded people and, over time, customs and cultures developed that were related to that geography, which, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began approximately around 400 BC and extended to approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century, the status of the Crusaders declined, especially because when they returned, the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital de la moda" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The pinnacle of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the Xth and the XIVth centuries.
At the beginning, the way of dressing was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, Western styles could take a delay of 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Agriculture of subsistence is understood as that which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family exclusively.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple practice, usually organic, which combines the use of stored seeds from the region with crop rotation and other simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of the small farmers was subsistence agriculture, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginación por los estándares sociales y les proporciona la posibilidad de generar un sentido de identidad.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a combination of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic traits of their belonging by using distinctive and symbolic styles, such as fashion, gestures and jargon.
One of the most common mechanisms for graphically representing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some of these children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children may have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or fleeing.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When a child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, he exhibits behaviors (within his physical capabilities) almost equal to those of the animal that cared for him, as well as his fear or indifference towards people.
Even though the project-based learning should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also a small animated subject in Microsoft Office is a scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolding is incorporated into the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to understand on his own.
Children are taken into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care or education; but it happens.
We can see that the family-based care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The objective of family placement is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home of the child before placement.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and people.
The different characteristics of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
In a study of the reactions of users to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), the authors also identified "personal participation" and "lasting relationships" as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that, by reading the microexpressions correctly, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", explained how those who cannot understand speech because of a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of a speaker with precision.
He also suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior can be shared with domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
The segregation and recombination of genes weigh on the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available to it.
Not doing so has serious consequences: slowing down of growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digested by primates like us, except if they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not surprise us if our predecessors solved their proteic problems in the same way that chimpanzees do today.
Interruption of sleep consists of waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a softer alarm clock that will bring him back to a conscious state, but without waking him completely.
The registration is an additional requirement in the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige him to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person enjoys is inversamente proporcional a la tensión que haya en su cuerpo y en su espíritu.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we have to deal. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all achieve illumination. The only thing that stands in our way is our tension and negativity.
While the basis of Tibetan Buddhism is the teaching of Buddha, it has spread along the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, the laísmo is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be cleared, the chakras activated and the consciousness of enlightenment developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture led to the separation of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies are now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The war would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that Poland's defense was already broken down on September 17, 1939, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize itself in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, the Soviet-Polish Mutual Assistance Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to ensure that its country can move its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The Atlantic campaign in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic with the aim of supporting Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did with other European countries.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
With the aim of obtaining easily their milk, hair, meat and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes started to keep them.
Domestic goats are usually gathered in herds that roam the hills or other areas of pasture, and are often tended by herdsmen who are usually children or teenagers, like the most popular shepherd.
In England, railway tracks had been installed in the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and carry heavier loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The sleepers were added early on to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused greater wear and tear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones, and in 1767, iron rails were used for the first time.
The first form of transport known was walking. Man began to do it upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
The Australopithecus did not have the habit of walking upright.
While bipedal fossils have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more friendly with the planet, join environmentalist movements or even become activists and fight to reduce, to some extent, the suffering of the future.
In many cases, it is like the asintomático. But if we are not only looking for a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of technological and scientific advances by humanity, and the problems have intensified because of overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, who lived a few blocks away.
Approximately 150 to 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies."
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time in the garden of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs by Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not represent them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs in the same way as the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate on the basis of the manipulation of coded data in binary.
A binary number can only have two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. For example, vomiting is too common a symptom to be able to make a diagnosis immediately.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is finding an open bottle of medicine or toxic cleaning products.
Read the label to obtain specific information about the first aid relevant to that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasite insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its former relationship with chinches, a species that has developed a very effective way of parasitizing humans.
The bedbugs and the clothesbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is estimated at about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the spinal cord, the medulla oblongata and the optic nerve are the targets of multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women have twice the chance of men of suffering from EM.
A couple could conclude that raising a child was not the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a child.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method serves as a guide for the vast majority of scientific investigations.
However, it is not an experiment, but a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of naturalists and philosophers was placed in the classical works; especially, in the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those on science and psychology, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Many of the rhythms present in physiological processes and in behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free cycle, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA consisted of a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fungus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic fragment and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have different effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks, and study of information on the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and often meet others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transfer launcher, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and they support it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the last two million years.
All of them are part of society and use the transport systems; and almost all of them complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason for the complaints of such a serious nature and why are there so many failures every day? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is not easy to study the flow of traffic, because it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency among drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to be represented approximately mathematically.
In order to graphically clarify the circulation flow, the three most important elements were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations facilitate both planning and design as well as the operation of the road vehicles.
The first insects to take flight were the insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, pressing them against their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of possible hiding places in small areas.
Currently, only the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera are unable to bend their wings.
Aristarco once centuries ago said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon River is the most voluminous and the second longest river in the world. It contains eight times more water than the river that follows it in size.
The Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water that flows into the world's oceans from rivers, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the pyramids of Guiza, nor in size nor in the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian village of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
The Vatican City, with approximately 800 inhabitants, is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Italian is used in the Vatican to draft its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by most of those working in the state is Italian, and Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All the citizens living in the Vatican City adhere to the Roman Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but at the same time it had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be the elements such as calcium and potassium. In addition, there también existen metals del tipo del oro y la plata.
It is also possible that there exist alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
As a result, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, after the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They do not even need to approach a pencil.
The only question is what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy vehicle rolls up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once again, it releases part of that energy.
Some atomic nuclei are unstable, that is, they tend to disgregarse con un mínimo o casi ningún empujón.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer shell is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there sont plus de mers sur le côté le plus proche, car la couche de la corteza est plus mince, ce qui a facilité à la lave de remonter à la surface.
Theories of content focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines maintain that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up to reach maturity.
These theories examine what makes some people want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On the one hand, there is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
It is difficult for managers in this category to make decisions that are unpopular with employees, to impose disciplinary measures, to carry out performance evaluations, to assign responsibilities and to demand accountability from the staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes someone who believes that everything that has been done so far must be changed and done in his own way.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This kind of behavior often distances the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical closest group.
In general, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet at different times, for example, which may not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an invisible "team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What could be the motive for an organization to submit to the process of establishing an organization for learning?
When all available resources are used appropriately in operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, il se peut que l'organisation qui travaille en équipe pour surmonter une difficulté de lieu puisse adopter un nouveau processus innovateur pour répondre aux besoins des clients.
To make an organization innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and increase its accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for developing simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a specialty of great importance within computer science, which is responsible for the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to diagnose and respond to customer queries, facial recognition, handwriting recognition, voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The Artificial Intelligence System is now used frequently in the economy, medicine, engineering and the military, as it was incorporated into various applications of video game software and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours. Students can see the exhibits on display in a museum, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as a memory album.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Because students are usually the most critical readers, the blogger begins to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also requires that students be more understanding of the world around them. The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to Internet content, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics." (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting it in Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsèquement canadien aux yeux des étrangers.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited.
For comparison, many are surprised to learn that more African Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of the Eastern African coast is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, without a doubt, the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wild life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the islands by Arabs and was largely imposed in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial impact of European and colonial influence took place in the 15th century, following the discovery by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the route that links Cape Town with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their real marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
If she rejects men, she should not be afraid to defend her position (cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians, who used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it in 1755 after a quiebra.
The city was rebuilt by Sultan Marroquí on order with the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan handicrafts are sold, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared to tourists.
Goma is a tourist point in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left most of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the Kivu North Province, where the fighting continues.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its gorilla trekking excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can take a motorcycle taxi (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francos) for a short trip.
This, added to the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given Tombuctú a picture of an exotic and distant land.
Today Tombuctú is a poor city, but it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included in the World Heritage List, which was due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the PBS special "African Wonders," hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecological zones, each of which has a different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all natural reserves in South Africa, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to all the parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
It has been compared the deployment of buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong with a luminous bar graph that is evident by the presence of waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and go to Kowloon Bay, located in front.
The reclaimed land on the northern coast of Hong Kong is where the city's dense urban development is concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove chain in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site.
Despite this, the forests are not only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or swamp.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a sanctuary for wild life and it is estimated that there sont 400 tigres réels de Bengala et 30 000 cerfs à queue blanche dans la zone.
Buses leave the station between districts (on the other side of the river) all day, but most of them, especially those traveling to the east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance.
Most districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a structure that spans the river, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a 15-meter-wide space, but although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is expected to be completed by September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will end.
The area that is now the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the indigenous group with the largest population in that region, and who lived as nomades hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá groups, for example, hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
Spanish settlers began the colonization stage, which lasted three centuries.
Since Paraguay was established in 1537, it has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also see other tournaments and lower division matches in other parts of the year.
At the Argentine Association of Polo website, you can get information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in relation to the British Pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. There you can change your money. It is in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling is accepted in any place on the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There is a chance that credit cards will not be accepted in the outer islands, but cash can be used. Ask the owners in advance which method of payment is accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money outside the Malvinas Islands, so it is advisable to do so before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: although it is rare for temperatures to fall below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild life is still wild, so it is not advisable to feed it or get in its way.
According to the instructions of the authorities of the parks, it is necessary to maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals.
Although they may appear dociles, the fact is that bears, bisonces, elk, bears and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors suffer injuries each year because they do not maintain a safe distance from the animals. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.
He also reminds you that the smell of food attracts bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid cooking food that releases a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 39,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for a British cruiser. More than 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the Mau leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches in Auckland, due to the fact that the city has two ports. The most famous are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, in the Pacific Ocean, are the beaches of North Shore, which extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most beaches are almost all sand with safe places to swim and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
In the Waitemata Harbour, the beaches of Tamaki Drive unfold, in the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complicated, but rather refreshing and pleasant.
While there is a great variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transport.
The local water from the tap is completely safe for consumption, but if he is worried, he can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the idea of "white coffee" foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
Belgian chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year, and, there, wounds caused by any of these causes are rare.
However, he accepted the advice of the authorities, respected all the signals and paid special attention to security alerts.
The Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish are found near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where the saltwater crocodiles live actively. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers located to the north of Rockhampton.
The accommodation booked in advance gives the traveller the peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, but it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined packages of flights and accommodation.
They can also keep the reservation in case they need time to think better about the offer, or to obtain other documents for their destination (for example, a visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, most of the people attending the events camp out at the venue and most of the spectators consider that this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, you will have to get there early to get a place near the musical events.
It is important to remember that, although the musical performances may have ended, in other parts of the festival they may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is located, because crossing the ice generates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During the cruises to St. Petersburg, time is also spent in the city. Those who disembark are exempt from the visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos normally make great efforts to maximize the time and money their customers spend. In general, there are no windows or clocks, and it can be difficult to find exits.
They usually offer special food, drink and entertainment promotions to keep their guests in good spirits and within the premises.
Some establishments serve free spirits. Although drunkenness affects judgment, a good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Any person who intends to drive in high latitudes or in mountain passes must foresee the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy or snow-covered roads, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as one does on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, a lot of snow can fall, which can trap a person in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by snow or ice that forms on the windows of a car.
On the other hand, in many countries, the conditions of ice and snow are normal and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
