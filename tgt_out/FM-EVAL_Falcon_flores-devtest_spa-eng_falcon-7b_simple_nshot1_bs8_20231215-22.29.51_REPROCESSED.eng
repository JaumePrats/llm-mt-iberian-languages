In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were plumíferos, a theory that is already widely accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this bird has a reddish brown plumage on the upper part and a pale or caroteneous color on the lower part.
In addition, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of the feathers of birds.
Given that the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed axis, called raquis, but they do have other feather features (hairs and barbules), the researchers came to the conclusion that the raquis is probably the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but to regulate temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a dinosaur juvenile, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

Even so, the Central American countries imposed tariffs of eighty percent on the products we manufacture. We treat you like that.
I thought that was unfair; definitely not fair.
All I tell people is that you treat us the same way we treat you.
A law proposal was dictated by the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, that forbids the sale or rent of violent video games to minors.
The law requires that video games that are sold in California be labeled with a sticker with the legend "18" and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000.

It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists walk on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about the suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is in charge of the processing, said that it would not make any additional comments until the indictment is issued.
According to the information that leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also discussed, according to information received, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the complementary pest control trial, the rangers had to supervise the shooters closely, as they were being monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the NSW Association of Sporting Shooters, volunteers were recruited from within the Association's membership.
Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS, said that a comprehensive training was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the generalized demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were provoked by the fact that no elections are being held, in some cases since 2011.
More than 60 iPods have been reported with problems of overheating and malfunctioning, which caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry commented on the delay in the Apple report, saying it was "truly lamentable."

In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer of that country hijacked a bus and held captive tourists who were coming from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, it has been confirmed that at least six have died.
All six hostages, including children and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an old lady because she needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday the government investigators managed to recover the black boxes of the crashed plane.
The wrestlers who were Luna's companions also paid tribute.

Dustin Oro in Dusty Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as me; even more so. I love her and I miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
From 2008 to 2010, 1400 people were surveyed before the federal elections of 2010, and 8% of them said they were against Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal elections campaign that Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II is over.
34% of the respondents share this view and want that Isabel II be the last Queen of Australia.
In one end of the survey, 29 % of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; in the other, 31 % think it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been put in doubt after his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers to relieve the pain, because their use is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the greatest known prime number.
Many people checked the discovery by using various types of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of the scientists is to understand how planets are formed, in particular our own, given that comets crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office in January and signed a law in February that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
Use satellite technology, in contrast to the old radar technology on the ground, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be provided and trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the dissuasive will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transportation, it was considered the possibility of playing the game closed doors, without the fanatics of the team.
On Thursday, the magazine Science reported about the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University and Uppsala University in Sweden have revealed that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated to take much longer, due to the reproduction of a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migratory, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take on any shape and be wound into tiny figures.
Not only can you hammer and roll into sheets, but you can also stretch it until you get a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. So thin is it that it can be used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with your hands that are wet and clean, express them to form a ball.
A reaction between the moisture in your hands and your external layers will occur, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, were found traces of sewer systems.
They also had public toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent to space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope to space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most relevant thing it has done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster way of transportation.
Thanks to her we have many means of transportation, like the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized carnivores that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including domestic cats) that feed on species of small size that exist in much greater abundance, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of his success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the felids that most socialize and their life takes place inside groups of large size called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family, united with up to thirty females and their calves.
Usually, females are very close to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behavior as wolf or dog prides, with whom they share a surprising similarity (unlike the other great cats) both in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The complete athlete, the tiger can climb (but not very well), swim, dive, and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a fully-formed roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. In the best case, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will be smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) by smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey mimicking their surroundings and then attack them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one from which they come (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily go back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
No changes have been made to the original population, which still needs the same adaptations as in the past.
As time goes by, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look more and more like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will not be able to be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable and fundamental consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so nothing feared it, except other members of its own species.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth, and another group of teeth in the palate, which means that anything that passed through his mouth, had no escape.
We don't have the certainty, but it could have been the viperine. Its diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs and even could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some unusual items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the lizard.
Another thing that distinguished them was that the poor and women ate sitting on a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and eating sideways.
It is not possible that the recipes of the ancient Rome include foods that arrived to Europe from America or Asia centuries after.
Verbigracia, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate, or any Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to satisfy their needs by celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
In some cases, they built special towers with a pyramid shape, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
The Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the patio; the shops were only showcases that opened to the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that he undertook more westward, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to his discovery, the Eskimos already inhabited the place at that time.
While each country was Scandinavian, there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie Treasure of the National Map, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. The reverse of the document contains something written, but it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has the following text on its reverse: "Declaration of Independence, original text of July 4, 1776". The text is on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that the huge document was only rolled up, measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out on D-Day, as well as the subsequent battles, had liberated the north of France, the south still remained.
His government was in the hands of the French "Vichy", who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed the peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the "Operation Dragon" was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In only two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
Civilization derives from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, and is related to the word civis, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city state, and which also determines the size of the society.
The states are the precursors of the nations. A culture of civilization with a long-term transmission of knowledge, a cultural legacy that is durable and a homogeneous propagation.
The minor cultures tend to disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and they are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to fix taxes, and since it was not a national executive or judicial power, the function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to make sure all its laws were enforced.
He was not authorized to annul tax laws or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second team with the most victories in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern zones, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
In Japan there are about 7000 islands (the largest one is Honshu), which makes it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, it is usually referred to as "Japan" as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who were sailing in the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, gave rise to a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labor to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty army took control of the coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this region as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see how they looked originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and the works continue today.
To illustrate, the most common format for fixed photography worldwide is 35 mm, which was the most used film size towards the end of the era of analog films.
Today, the process is still going on, but the most important thing is that the dimensional relationship has been transferred to the digital image sensors of the cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is confusing, since its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relation of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest rational number) is equivalent to 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g., the APS group) are similar or look very much like this relationship of appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the object of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing for some order in the images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of the history of Europe, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had managed to unite the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the king to the people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church are reserved for that specific function.
The dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
Although the strategy, which involved the interruption of military and civilian supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognized international legal principle and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Great Britain extracted international waters in complete sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral ships at risk.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would find a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid that situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation letter written by Charles Batchelor (his last employer) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many of its political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same happens with the military, since now the charges are based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed people to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has endured through the ages, illustrates very realistically the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
On the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains in the surroundings. From the inside of this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one that still stands is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramids of the same shape and size built to worship the deceased pharaoh.
The Guiza Plateau, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built in honor of his wives and relatives.
The mark of "upward arc" is similar to a V and the mark of "downward arc" is similar to a grap or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The ascending movement of the arch generates a softer sound, whereas a descending movement is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on the bow have been printed in that place with a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a executed guard in Versailles in front of the Queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war expenses of the imperialism of the U.S. in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the banks of Wall Street.
From the very beginning, the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of profits for the American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in Europe in which these events take place is known as the Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300.
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The determinism of technology is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the impulse or imperative technological to a strict sense of that there is a subyacente logic that drives the destiny of humanity and that is related to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds along an independent path from any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of highways is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair the damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography molded people and, with the passing of time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, being in harmony with that location, were preferred to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered as such in the feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began approximately in 400 BC and extended until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its status decayed, especially due to the fact that, upon their return, the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "capital of fashion" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the way of dressing received great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the western styles could take a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe started to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
It is understood by agriculture of subsistence that whose objective is to produce enough food to feed only the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of seeds stored in the region with the rotation of crops and other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, the main activity of the farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many countries in the path of development.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality due to the standards of social life and provides them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The traits that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic traits of their belonging by using distinctive and symbolic styles, such as fashion, gestures and slang.
One of the most common mechanisms for graphically representing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or fleeing.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost equal to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Although the project-based learning should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are going through a new experience, such as the use of a new software program or the beginning of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also is the small animated sticky note of Microsoft Office.
Virtual ropes are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand on his own.
The children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family-based care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The objective of the foster care is to cover all the needs that were not attended in the home of origin with previous foster care.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different traits that characterize the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of the users to the web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), the "participation personal" and the "durability relationships" were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that, by reading its microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained the way in which those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate the sincerity of a speaker with precision.
He even suggests that the skills for interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of a human, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the resources of plants that it has at its disposal.
Moreover, not doing it entails serious problems: slowing down of growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of vegetable resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except when cooked.
On the other hand, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
The interruption of sleep consists in waking up intentionally during the normal sleep period and sleeping again after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a soft alarm clock that will wake him up without waking him up completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm consist in drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige him to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The more relaxed the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we can count. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that blocks the way is our tension and negativity.
While the bases of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread through the path of love Mahayana and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, the laísmo is very simple. It is based on the kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be unblocked, the chakras can be activated and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up by distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that for the 17th of September 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize itself in the extension of the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union invaded and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, the Polish-Soviet bilateral agreement, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
For as long as the navy has existed, its function has been to guarantee that its country can transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The Atlantic Campaign in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to cut off this circulation.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken over Britain, just as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and skin, the ancient tribes and peoples started to hunt them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered the hills or other areas of grazing, often tended by herdsmen who were children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, the railways had been installed in the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel boards of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and drag heavier loads than on the rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place was carried out quite early. However, gradually, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
It became a regular practice, although the iron caused a greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones and, in 1767, iron rails were used.
The first form of transportation known was walking. The human being began to do it in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Our ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking erect.
While bipedal tracks have been found in fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, join environmentalist movements or, even, we can become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, the future suffering.
Yes, in many cases, it is like the asintomatic treatment. But if we are not looking for a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has undergone great changes, due to the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4, 1776, the draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, who lived a few blocks away.
About 150 to 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies."
It was John Nixon who read the Declaration of Independence for the first time and did it in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On July 6, 1776, a copy of the Declaration of Independence was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A great number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are birds.
Many people don't represent them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work with the manipulation of data coded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to the computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is finding an open bottle of medicines or cleaning chemicals.
Read the label for specific information about the first aid specific to that poison.
Entomologists use the term parasite insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with the chinch, a very developed species to parasitize humans.
The bedbugs and the bedbugs are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States have risen to about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among adults young and middle-aged.
The central nervous system, the union of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women have twice the chances of men to suffer from EM.
A couple could conclude that raising a child would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could plan to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not a test, however, it is a procedure that is used to discard some of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing what guides the scientific investigation.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was put on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those of science, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in the behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining way and have a free period of operation, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that the DNA consisted of a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visits to parks, and study of information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking pictures and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place from which they just came.
In this dynamic transfer vehicle, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists support the idea that the massive release of carbon dioxide has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of the society and uses the transportation systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is not common to hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
What is the reason for the complaints about the transportation systems that are so severe and why do they happen daily? Are the engineers of the transportation systems simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial that is happening?
The traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the traffic flow, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of the drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and can be represented approximately by mathematical models.
In order to graphically represent the flow of traffic, three important elements were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning and design of the road network as well as the operations of the road network.
The first species to take flight were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, sticking them to the sides of their bodies.
This provides a larger range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects unable to fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Millennia ago, a man called Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, correct?
The Amazon River is the most caudalous and the second most extensive river in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water that flows from the rivers of the world that flow into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the pyramids of stone continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian town of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
The Italian is used in the Vatican City, both for drafting its regulations and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that is spoken daily by most people who work in the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The total number of citizens living in the Vatican City are Catholics.
The basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is formed by a combination of one or several of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
He was the one who had the most similarity with the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but at the same time, he had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements like calcium and potassium. From now on, there are metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with the presence of small amounts of carbon, which are not metals.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Because of that, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, due to the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need a pencil.
Only time will tell what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to decompose with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km on the side close to it and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more waves on the side closer to the Falls, as the bark is thinner, which facilitated the lava to rise to the surface.
The content theories are focused on finding out what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines claim that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up to reach maturity.
These theories analyze what causes some people to want certain things and what factors of their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two very well known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
The managers of this category have a hard time making decisions that are unpopular with the employees, imposing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and demanding accountability from the staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it necessary to change everything that has been done until now by the group and do it in its own way.
In the end, the ultimate success or failure of the team is the leader.
This way of behaving often distances the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional equipment apply to virtual equipment, although there are some small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet at different times, which, for example, might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What motive could an organization have for submitting to the process of establishing an organization for learning? One of the purposes of applying the concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the available resources are used in the operational departments of an organization, there is space for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that the process of an organization that works in a team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process to attend the needs of customers.
To make an organization innovative, the leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous focus as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They reduce the field of research and give it greater precision.
The correlation between the cerebral pathology and the behavior contributes to the research of the scientists.
It has been known for a long time that several types of brain damage, traumas, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the new technologies, we have the possibility to see and investigate the structures and processes that take place in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material for developing simulation models, which help us understand the mental processes.
While it is often associated with science fiction, artificial intelligence is a very important field within computer science, which is responsible for the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligent machines.
The research in the field of AI implies the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this are, among others, monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and customer queries, as well as facial recognition, handwriting, voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
The system of Artificial Intelligence is now often used in the economy, medicine, engineering and the military, in the same way as it was incorporated in various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common that a teacher wants to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual tour is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital of the state and every year the website is updated, but the previous versions are kept online as a memory album.
Blogs can also contribute to improve the writing of students. Even though students usually start their blogging experience with a poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes in front of an audience.
Because students are usually the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Likewise, blogging "requires that students be more understanding of the world around them." The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics.
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries that exhibit the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more south and the north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting it from Muskoka and the extension that follows.
All these aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian to the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison of the population that causes great surprise to many: there are more African Americans in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is in the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wild life.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and it was imposed, in large part, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The first footstep of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, as a result of the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that unites the Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their real marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round-shouldered to reject men and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, that's not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco on the order of the Spanish merchants who established their businesses there and called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist point of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the eastern border, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left most of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the North Kivu province.
In addition, the city is the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To get inside Goma, you can take a boda-boda (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
It is also relatively inaccessible, which has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and distant image.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included in the World Heritage List due to the threat of the desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts much with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecoregions, in each of which a different wild life develops.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all the natural reserves of South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks of the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island homonymous, which is the destination of most tourists consider the main attraction.
The skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a bar graph that is lit up by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and go to the Kowloon side, located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where the urban development is most dense.
This is the place that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see proofs of the colonial past of this region, this is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest inside the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Despite that, the forests are not only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extension is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of the wild life and it is estimated that there are now 400 tigers in the area and 30 000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the bus station to all districts (on the other side of the river) all day, but most, especially those going to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are usually full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance.
Most of the districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cantilever bridge that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that currently constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The region of Guaycurú was inhabited by other aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spanish started the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also witness other tournaments and lower-level games in other parts of the year.
In the Argentine Polo Association site you will get information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo games.
The value of the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP), official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. It is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling is usually accepted in any place within the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There are chances that in the islands of the periphery they do not accept credit cards, but they could use British or American money. Ask in advance to the owners to be able to define which is the accepted payment method.
It is practically impossible to change money from the Malvinas Islands outside the archipelago, so it is advisable to do it before leaving.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is located south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere is winter and viceversa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
The winter cold can be deceptive: while it is very rare that temperatures are below the freezing point, the wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, the wild life is still wild, so don't feed it or disturb it.
According to the authorities of the parks, it is recommended to maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals.
Despite their gentle appearance, it is true that bison, uapatíes, elk, bears and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors suffer injuries every year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid cooking food that releases a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of about 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the boats, except for a British cruiser. More than two hundred Americans and Germans died.
During the war for independence that the Mau movement faced, a peaceful meeting in the city had as a result the assassination of the state chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a great number of beaches, due to the fact that Auckland has two ports. The most famous ones are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, in the Pacific Ocean, are the beaches of North Shore, which extend from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
The beaches are almost all of sand with safe places to swim and most of them have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
In the port of Waitemataas, the beaches of Tamaki Drive unfold, in the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the local beer most popular and is not complex, but rather refreshing and pleasant. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a great variety of French wines, the New Zealand and Australian ones could be considered better for transport.
The local water from the tap is completely safe for consumption, but if he worries, he can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the notion of "black coffee" foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and, there, wounds by any of these causes are rare.
However, take the advice of the authorities, respect all the signs and pay special attention to the safety alerts.
The jellies are found near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers from October to April, north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where the salt water crocodiles live actively. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
The reservation of accommodation in advance gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined packages of flights and accommodation.
They can also keep the reservation in case you need time to think better about the offer, or to get other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, most of the people attending the events decide to camp in the place and most of the spectators consider that it is a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action, then you should arrive early to the camp to get a place near the musical events.
