In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that is already widely accepted, it also offers specific data that fossils generally do not, such as their colour and three-dimensional structure.
According to the experts, this bird has a reddish-brown upper plumage and a pale or carotenoid lower plumage.
Moreover, the discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Given that the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed axis, called the rachis, but do have other features of feathers (barbs and quills), the researchers came to the conclusion that the rachis is probably the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but that they were used to regulate temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers say that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analysed shows adult plumage features and not those of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

Although it was a highly theoretical work, the programme was written with the aim of simulating the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way would be responsible for the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the galaxy of Sagittarius in the same way as the moon exerts a force of attraction on our planet and causes the tides.
The experts came to the conclusion that dark matter is affected in the same way as regular matter.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy is located around it in a class of halo and consists of numerous small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in South Africa's Zululand area.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant generated "much concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate."
Dr Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of the infected were staff at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they have had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the total of TB patients still seems to be relatively low: 6000 of a total of 333 000 patients infected at a particular time in South Africa.

The authorities have also guaranteed several million doses of the vaccine to fight against encephalitis, which will allow health companies to prepare for next year.
This year, a shortage of financial resources and a lack of prioritisation, compared with other diseases, have led to delays in the implementation of vaccination plans in historically vulnerable regions.

In France, elections have traditionally been a relatively low-tech experience: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed ballot in an envelope indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter enters the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voters' list.
The French electoral law sets out the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, which allows voters and observers to check that there are no extra ballots at the start of voting and that no other ballots are added which are not those of the voters, properly counted and authorised.
The candidates have the right to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, the volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

The bill requires violent video games sold in California to be labeled with a "M" rating and penalizes their sale to minors with a $1,000 fine.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce will be brought to trial.
Huhne has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take over Davey's role as business minister.
16 February is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are due to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21, died. Cuddeback was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun jammed as he aimed it at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, he can only see out of one eye, and part of his skull is missing. His face was reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave evidence via a virtual link from a US Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo took part in two individual races apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "Did not finish the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished 10th in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four slalom skiers in the category did not complete their races and a total of 45 participants in the Giant Slalom did not reach the classification in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh were able to recover the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is under arrest awaiting trial, any eyewitness statement can be questioned, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, said it would not be making any further comment until the charge sheet is issued.
According to the information that has been leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the existing boundaries prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also discussed, according to information received, included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations regard as sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while the PA is only willing to accept five.
During the supplementary pest control trial, gamekeepers had to keep a close eye on the shooters, as this was being monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the New South Wales Association of Sporting Shooters (NSW) Inc., suitably qualified volunteers were recruited within the Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is currently in charge, provisionally, of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS, noted that comprehensive training and safety was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English initials) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the previous CEP resign, as part of a series of measures designed to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the widespread protests that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, at times violent, were triggered by the fact that elections are not being held, in some cases since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had registered 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry said the delay in Apple's report was "truly regrettable".
Mariana was shaken by a quake at 7:19 local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage on the national territory.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country hijacked a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have died.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research into premature birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that investigators from the government recovered the flight data recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid their respects.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the Extreme. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Powder Runnels said: "Luna was as rare as I am; even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Since 2008, among the 1400 people surveyed in advance of the 2010 federal elections, there has been an 8% increase in those opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II was over.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At one end of the survey, 29% of people think that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other end, 31% think it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner in the 100m and 200m freestyle should have swum the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been called into question following his complaints.
He could not take painkillers to relieve the pain, because their use is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery through the use of various types of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets have served as a source of water supply for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the capacity to form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets are formed, particularly our own, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the start of the year and last month signed a law allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He dismissed the rumours as "political gossip and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce flight distances, which would save millions of gallons of fuel a year, as well as carbon emissions.
Uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, the possibility was considered that the game would be played behind closed doors, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the science magazine Science reported on the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Experts from the University of Princeton, in the US, and from Uppsala University, in Sweden, have revealed that the new species evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated to take much longer, because of the reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migratory, Geospiza scandens.
Gold can take on any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it into a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it could be used to decorate illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will change depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product being analysed determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of depriving a proton of its electron.
Mix both dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in their hands and their external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had odourless toilets in almost all the houses, connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had sanitary workers in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to give us much simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to her today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including independent domestic cats) that feed on species in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the big cats that most socialise and their lives take place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males from the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their calves.
Generally, females are very close to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behaviour as wolf packs or dogs, with whom they have a remarkable similarity (unlike the other great cats) in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, dive and pull five times as hard as a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but more like a sentence spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. Where possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will be much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) using their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) moves away from the main population from which they come (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they can't easily go back), they will often find themselves in a different environment to the one they were used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still require the same adaptations as in the past.
Over time, as the growing population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble less and less the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that it will no longer be possible to classify them as belonging to the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
Plant food is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. They also offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except from other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, as well as another group in the palate, which means that anything that came his way had no escape.
We don't have the security, but it could have had the viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and even a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even the huge T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some rather unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that set them apart was that the poor and women ate sitting down, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and reclining as they ate.
It is not possible that the ancient Roman recipes included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
The people made sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of those celebrating festivals and ceremonies.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramidal towers were built, called ziggurats, to form part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only showrooms that faced the street. Houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
While each country was 'Scandinavian', there were marked differences in relation to the people, monarchs, habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, perhaps you believe that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Nevertheless, that is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has written on its reverse the phrase "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that the huge parchment document (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out on D-Day, as well as the subsequent battles, had achieved the liberation of northern France, the south still remained.
His government was in the hands of the Vichy French, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed a peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders rather than fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, Operation Dragon was launched, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture of a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilisation derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related both to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city state and which, in some way, determines the size of the society.
State cities are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogenous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and are not recognised as civilisations in their own right.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, this function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
He was not empowered to annul fiscal laws or customs duties between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all the states for their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, together with the German selection, is the second team in the world with the most victories and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most popular are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the north, with athletes taking part in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
There are about 7,000 islands in Japan, the largest of which is Honshu, making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who were sailing through the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labour to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The army of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the coastal and western regions of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this latter as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three major buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and work continues today.
To illustrate, the most common format for still photography at the global level is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the era of film photography.
Today it is still being produced, but the most important thing is that their dimensional relationship has been transferred to the image sensors of digital cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is something confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
This is why it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by twelve in order to calculate the simplest rational number) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS format group) are similar or very similar to this relationship of appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant mockery and often ridiculed, is a simple rule that generates dynamism as well as providing a certain order to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the rabble.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be used for that specific purpose.
The central core of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such a measure violated the generally recognized and contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters in whole sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany was expecting a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by the majority of citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with Edison in New York.
He arrived in the U.S. with four cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was that of the Three Kingdoms, when thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, because instead of basing military charges on class, they are now based on rank.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other working class people in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured in time, realistically illustrates the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the summit of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca, lies a cave totally cut off from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one is sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains in the vicinity. From the inside of this cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many pyramidal structures built to honour the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many others of this type, tombs and smaller temples were built in honour of his wives and relatives.
The "upward arrow" mark is similar to a V and the "downward arrow" mark is similar to a grapheme or a square without its bottom edge.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog and pull the bow.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, whereas a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that the marks on stringed instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and, therefore, should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Maria Teresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and his sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd who were shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook his head at the executed guard in front of the Queen, who was in a panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. with the purpose of paying the majority of the expenses and interests of the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the Wall Street banks.
Already, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in which these events take place is known as the Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (that is, between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological imperative to a strict sense that there is a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and that is related to the laws of science and how they are reflected in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself unfolds on an independent path from any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of cars necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not viable economically for a reduced volume of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of cars also generates a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to studies by Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography moulded people and, with the passing of time, customs and cultures developed which were related to that geography which, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the city of fashion, Constantinople was known as such in feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicentre of luxury began approximately 400 BC and extended until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its status declined, especially because, on their return, the Crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of 'capital of fashion' was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the form of dress was greatly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is understood to be that which aims to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family exclusively.
Subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, which combines the use of indigenous seeds from the region with crop rotation and other comparatively simple methods to maximise production.
Historically, the main activity of farmers was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of social marginality and provides them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is often the case that members of a subculture will use distinctive and symbolic styles, such as fashion, gestures and jargon, to identify themselves as belonging to that subculture.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms for graphing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a severely disabled child.
It is possible that wild children have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were brought up by animals and that some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is reared exclusively by animals different from humans, it presents behaviour (within its physical capabilities) almost identical to that of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a bit further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can present itself both in real and virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also a small animated paper clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is incorporated into the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand on their own.
Children are taken into care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care or education; but it happens.
We can see that the foster care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving foster parents, sustained education and reliable medical care.
The purpose of family placement is to meet all the needs that were not met in the home from which the child was removed.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different aspects of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few hundredths of a second.
Specifically, it is claimed that, through the appropriate reading of microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained the way in which those who cannot understand speech because of a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate sincerity with precision.
Even suggests that the ability to interpret human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination balance the variation between one and the next generation from generation to generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available to it.
Moreover, not doing so entails serious problems: economic slowdown, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been the simplest source of vegetable resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except when cooked.
In contrast, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not come as a surprise if our own predecessors resolved their 'protein problems' in the same way as chimpanzees do today.
Waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a fairly soft alarm clock which will bring him back to a conscious state without waking him completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige you to get up to go to the toilet.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we can cope. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all attain enlightenment. The only thing that blocks the way is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread along the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In general terms, laicism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be unblocked, the chakras can be activated and the consciousness of enlightenment can be developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. When the war ended, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who had been allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that for the 17th of September 1939 the Polish defence was already broken, its only hope was to retreat and reorganise itself in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way of moving large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Since time immemorial, the function of the navy has been to ensure that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in the Second World War offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not been successful, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did in the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10 000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
In order to obtain easily their milk, hair, meat and skin, the ancient peoples and tribes started to take them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasture, often tended by shepherd boys who were usually children or teenagers, like the most popular shepherd.
In England, railway tracks had already been laid by the 16th century.
Even though the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel boards of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and carry heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The introduction of sleepers to keep the rails in place took place quite early on. However, it gradually became apparent that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper surfaces.
This became a regular practice, although the iron caused more wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels and, in 1767, iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transport known was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Our predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While bipedal tracks have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, be part of environmentalist movements or even become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is manifest that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent by hand and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, to the print shop of John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap copies".
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs by Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work on the manipulation of coded data under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to enable a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be finding an open bottle of medicines or toxic cleaning products.
Read the label for information on specific first aid for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term insect parasite in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with fleas, a species very developed to parasitize humans.
Bedbugs and clothes moths are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been reported in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, a union of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies showed that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from EM.
A couple might conclude that bringing up a baby would not be the best thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on the classical works, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those on science and psychology, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behaviour depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA was a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using viruses.
Two experiments were carried out in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulphur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks, and study of information on the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work, and they often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place from which they have just come.
In this dynamic transfer vehicle, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists are saying that this massive economy of carbon has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear such complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
What is the reason that transport systems give rise to complaints of such a scale and why do failures occur daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study traffic flow, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to have a logical consistency and to be represented approximately by mathematical models.
In order to graph more clearly the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both planning and design as well as the operation of road traffic devices.
The first species to fly were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, pressing them against their bodies.
This provides a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects unable to fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemera.
Millennia ago, a man called Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon River is the most voluminous and the second longest river in the world. It contains eight times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total amount of water from the world's rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 per cent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they were never surpassed in size or in the sublime technique of their construction.
The old Egyptian town of the New Empire was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Italian is used in the Vatican both to draft its legislation and to issue its official statements.
The language spoken daily by the majority of those who work within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in the Vatican adhere to the Roman Catholic religion.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known from antiquity, since all of them can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
It had a greater resemblance to the states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but at the same time it had the theory that they are transformed into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium. Already, there are metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metals.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Therefore, when the pencil was invented, it won many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need a pencil.
The only question is what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, i.e. they tend to decompose with a minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These doctrines assert that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they have grown to maturity.
These theories analyse what makes some people want certain things and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum is the attempt to continue to be "one of the boys" (or girls).
Managers in this category find it hard to make decisions that are unpopular with employees, impose disciplinary measures, carry out performance appraisals, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into an unknown person who believes it necessary to change everything that the group has done until now and do it in its own way.
In the end, the ultimate success or failure of the team is down to the leader.
This kind of behaviour often ends up distancing the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their nearest physical team.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet at different times, for example, times that might not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of management and to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the process of establishing a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used appropriately in operational departments of an organization, space is created for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result of this, it may be possible for an organisation that works as a team to overcome a difficulty of place to a new innovative process in order to meet customer needs.
For an organisation to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and increase its accuracy.
The correlation existing between brain pathology and behaviour contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material for developing simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important specialty within computer science, which deals with behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to diagnose and respond to customer queries, as well as facial, handwriting and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence is now used in many sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and the military, just as it was incorporated into various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital and each year the page is updated, but the previous versions are archived as an online scrapbook.
Blogs can also contribute to improving student writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Due to the fact that students are often the most critical readers, the blogger starts to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Likewise, blogging requires students to be more understanding of the world around them. The need to engage the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through an active response to internet content, students can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, as well as establish their perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are more south and the north hosts the natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows.
These aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated and some are wild land, almost uninhabited.
To make a population comparison that causes great surprise to many: more African Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of Eastern Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we are talking about wild life.
Most of the smallest islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The first step of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, of the route linking Europe with India.
The region borders on the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in rejecting men and do not fear defending your position (cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of the White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan with the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as earthenware pots, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, but everything is geared to tourists.
Goma is a tourist point in the Democratic Republic of Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is quite safe, any trip outside should be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the ongoing clashes in the North Kivu province.
In turn, the city is the base for scaling the volcano Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To travel within Goma, you can take a motorcycle taxi (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
The fact that it is relatively inaccessible has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and distant image.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included on the World Heritage in Danger List as a result of the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which has a different wild life.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognised as the icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all natural reserves in South Africa, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
A comparison has been made between the buildings that delimit the horizon of Hong Kong and a luminous bar chart that shows the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront, located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where the dense urban development is concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove chain, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site.
Despite this, the forests are not just mangroves, but also contain some of the last remaining trees of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swamp.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of wild life and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is an easy and comfortable way to travel to nearby places like Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cantilever structure that spans it, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two 3.5 m wide lanes.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 metres and, although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when it is expected that Brazilian customs controls will end.
The eastern part of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spaniards began the stage of colonisation, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
They can also see other tournaments and lower league games at other times of the year.
On the site of the Argentine Association of Polo you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo games.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in terms of the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there in front of the FIC West shop in Stanley.
Sterling is usually accepted anywhere on the islands. In Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or US dollars.
There is a good chance that credit cards will not be accepted in the outer islands, but you could use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance which method of payment is accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so do it before you leave.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: while it is very rare for temperatures to fall below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically 'rainy' or 'dry' stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild life is still wild, so do not feed it or get in its way.
According to the instructions of the park authorities, at least 100 yards/meters must be maintained from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals.
In spite of how gentle they may appear, the fact is that bears, bison, elk, bears and practically all large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors suffer injuries each year by not maintaining a safe distance from animals. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
In addition, remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted by smells, so you should avoid cooking foods that release a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of around 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
They sank all the ships, except a British cruiser. Two hundred Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau independence movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, due to the fact that Auckland has two ports. The most famous are in three areas.
In the district of North Harbour, in the Pacific Ocean, are the beaches of North Shore, which stretch from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
The beaches are almost all sand with safe places to swim and most have pohutukawa trees which offer shade.
In the Waitemata Harbour, the beaches of Tamaki Drive unfold in the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the local beer most popular and it is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a great variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better for transporting.
The local water from the tap is completely safe for drinking, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the notion of "white coffee" to be foreign. A small black coffee is called an "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips are made to the reef throughout the year and, there, wounds by any of these causes are rare.
In any case, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all the signals and pay special attention to security alerts.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them are afraid of them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where actively living salt water crocodiles reside. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
The advance booking of accommodation gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to stay when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camp sites.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
You can also keep the reservation in case you need time to think better about the offer, or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
However, any modification or request should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the majority of those attending the music events decide to camp at the site and most of the audience consider this to be a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the action, then you should get there early to get a place near the musical events.
It is important to note that, while the musical performances may have ended, in other parts of the festival they may continue until the early hours of the morning.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is located, because crossing the ice generates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During the cruises to St. Petersburg, time is also spent in the city. Those who disembark are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Normally, casinos make great efforts to maximise the time and money that their customers spend. Generally, there are no windows or clocks and exits can be difficult to find.
Special offers of food, drink and entertainment are often offered to keep guests in good spirits and within the premises.
Some establishments serve free spirits. Although drunkenness affects judgment and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Any person who intends to drive at high altitudes or in mountain passes must be prepared for the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy or snow-covered roads, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as one does on bare tarmac.
During snowstorms, a lot of snow can fall in a very short time, leaving you trapped.
In addition, visibility can be reduced by snow or by condensation or ice that forms on the car windows.
On the other hand, in many countries the conditions of ice and snow are normal and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely to be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable for many visitors.
The popular use of the term'safari' refers to overland journeys to see the remarkable wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach vehicles and the standard equipment will provide good visibility.
Sometimes leopards, lions and jaguars can be shy, so you will have a better chance of seeing them using binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as 'walking between the bushes','safari on foot' or 'walk') is a walking expedition, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between 24 August and 5 September 2021. A number of events will take place in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, there may be complications.
There are different types of travel cancellation policies, but from the end of March, the coverage of most of these policies based on the coronavirus does not extend until July 2020, which is when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the majority of entries to events will cost between JPY 2,500 and JPY 130,000 and that common passes will cost JPY 7,000.
Ironing clothes while they are still wet can help to dry them. Many hotels provide an iron and ironing board for guests, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a flat iron available, or if you don't want to use a flat iron, you can try using a blow dryer, if available.
Do not let the fabric get too hot, as it could shrink or, in extreme cases, catch fire.
There are different methods for purifying water, some are more effective against certain specific threats.
In some places, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others, it takes several more.
Not all filters have the same effectiveness and, if this concerns you, you should consider buying bottled water with a certified seal.
It is possible that travellers may come into contact with pests of which there is no knowledge in the regions from which they come.
Plagues are capable of ruining food, causing irritation or, in more serious cases, triggering allergic reactions, spreading poison or transmitting infections.
Infectious diseases, by themselves, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals through the use of their force, are not usually included in the category of plagues.
Free trade in customs duties offers an opportunity to acquire, in certain places, duty-free products.
Travellers to countries with a high tax burden can, sometimes, save a significant amount of money, particularly on goods such as spirits and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Turnpike, the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont is one of the most challenging stretches of road and is often traversed through isolated and lonely terrain.
If you don't usually drive on rural roads, stay alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow roads and tight curves.
The established speed limits are notoriously lower than on the previous sections and those that follow, generally 56-64 km/h (35-40 mph), and strict compliance is even more important than on any other section.
However, curiously, cell phone signals are much better here than in many other sections of the road like Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is of good quality and, in Bavaria, the cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those made in Austria, its neighbour to the south.
Common are fruit tarts, with cooked apples inside all year round and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. In general, popular cakes make a great combination with a strong cup of coffee.
If you have a craving for small but tasty pastries, try the Berliner, also known as a Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a recipe based on herbs and spices and served with meat or vegetables.
We can find dry and wet curry, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the villages of the northern interior of India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry. In the south of India and in other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more common.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines that are spread throughout the country.
However, employed without any other qualification, the term tends to refer to the original cuisine of the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, currently available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of dishes seasoned with simple condiments, with a predilection for the aromas preferred by the Javanese, such as peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the supports for the feet of the riders who hang on both sides of the saddle.
While providing greater stability for the rider, they can present problems of safety, as it is possible that their feet may get caught in them.
If a jockey is thrown from a horse, but his foot is caught in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the animal bolts. To reduce the risk, there are a series of safety precautions.
First of all, the majority of riders use riding boots with a toe cap and a fairly narrow sole.
In addition, there are saddles, especially English saddles, with safety bars that allow the leathers of the saddle to come away from the structure if a rider who falls off pulls back.
Cochamo Valley is the most popular climbing destination in Chile and is known as the "Yosemite of South America" for its extensive walls and granite cliffs.
The summits also offer impressive views from the peaks. Climbers from all corners of the globe are constantly delimiting new paths between their walls of infinite potential.
Snow sports such as downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular disciplines that consist of sliding down a slope on skis or a snowboard, on snow.
Skiing is a major activity of travel with many enthusiasts, sometimes called'ski lovers', who organise their holidays completely around skiing in a specific place.
The idea of skiing is very old, as there are cave paintings that depict skiers and which date back around 5,000 years.
Alpine skiing as a discipline dates from the 17th century. In 1861 the Norwegians founded the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacker on skis: also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring or backcountry skiing.
Although they are linked, in general they do not involve the practice of cross-country skiing or alpine mountaineering, developed on steep slopes and with skis and boots much more rigid.
Imagine the ski slope as a hiking trail.
In satisfactory conditions, it will be able to cover distances a little longer than if it were on foot, but very rarely will it reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy rucksack on prepared ski slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling to several countries would mean having to deal with visa applications and passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen space works as a single country in this sense.
Generally, if you move within this region, you will be able to cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
In the same way, with a Schengen visa, you do not need separate permits for each of the member states of this space. This will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects older than 100 years are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit could be more restricted in places like North America than in Europe.
It may happen that handmade products are classified as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar products manufactured in series.
Reindeer husbandry is a fundamental way of life for the Lapps and the culture associated with this commercial activity is important for many engaged in other professions.
Even so, even traditionally, not all the Lapps have devoted themselves to reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but have lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Today, many Lapps work in modern commercial activities. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sámi region.
While it is used extensively, especially among those who are not Roma, the term gypsy is often given a pejorative connotation, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate assessments of Roma.
If your destination country is subject to a travel alert, this could affect your medical insurance or cancellation insurance.
It is possible that you want to consult the recommendations of other governments, but they are intended for their own citizens.
For example, a North American visitor to the Middle East might face different situations from those of a European or an Arab.
Travel warnings are only a brief summary of the political situation in another country.
The views presented are often superficial, generic and too simplistic in comparison with the more detailed information available on other sites.
The term severe climate refers, in general, to any climatic event that is capable of causing serious damage, social disruption or death of people.
Severe weather can occur anywhere on the planet and there are different types depending on the geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Hurricanes, pebbles, excessive rains and forest fires are types and consequences of extreme weather, as are lightning storms, tornadoes, water spouts or cyclones.
Among regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena, we find windstorms, snowstorms, ice or dust storms.
It is strongly recommended to travellers to find out about any extreme weather risks in the area they are visiting, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a trip to a country that could be described as a war zone should receive professional training.
It is likely that when looking for "Course on Hostile Environments" on the Internet, one will find the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail and, in general, with practical experience.
A normal course lasts between 2 and 5 days, and includes role-playing games, first aid, and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines about survival in nature are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Passengers who have booked a sex change operation in another country must ensure they have valid travel documents for the return journey.
The position of the governments on the possibility of issuing passports without gender declaration (X) or updated documents in order to bring the name of the person in line with the gender with which they identify themselves.
The readiness of foreign governments to honour these documents varies greatly.
Security checks at border posts have become more intrusive since 11 September.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone gender reassignment surgery should not have their dignity and privacy compromised by passing through airport scanners.
Return currents are the flow that recedes from the waves that break on the shore, frequently in a reef or similar.
Because of the submarine topography, the return flow gathers in certain areas of greater depth and there can be a rapid current with a direction to deeper waters.
The majority of drownings occur as a result of trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as I escape from the current, swimming back will not be more difficult than usual.
Try to reach a place where you will not be caught again or, if you have the skills and someone has seen you, it may be convenient to wait for rescue.
The impact of returning home comes before the cultural (there is no honeymoon period), takes longer to go and can be harder.
People who find it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their native culture.
When he returns home after living abroad, he will have adapted to this new culture and will have lost some of the habits of his native culture.
When you travelled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding, because they knew that travellers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not foresee that tolerance and understanding are also needed for travellers returning home.
The light and sound show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
In the darkness, you can see the pyramids and look at them in silence before the show starts.
Generally, you will hear the sound of tourists and vendors at all times. The history of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx appears as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected on the pyramids and all of them are illuminated.
The discovery of the Shetland Islands South occurred in 1819 and several nations claim them. They have the largest number of bases, reaching 16 active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the Iberian Peninsula. The largest island is Jorge, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include the island of Livingstone and Deception, where there is a spectacular natural harbour formed by the flooded crater of an active volcano.
The Ellsworth Land, whose boundaries are defined by the Bellingshausen Sea, is a region located to the south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the Peninsula mix with the plain and then emerge to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern sector, the Sentinel Range contains the highest peaks of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with its summit at 4892 metres on Mount Vinson.
In remote areas where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone cannot be compared to a mobile phone, because, in order to make a call, one must be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite.
The service is often used in water transport, including recreational vessels, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice.
You can contact your local telephone service provider for more information on how to subscribe to this service.
Combining travel and learning has become a very popular option for those who plan to take a sabbatical.
This is very popular among school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before university without putting their education at risk.
In many cases, enrolling in a study abroad program during a sabbatical year can, in fact, increase the chances of gaining access to higher education once one returns to one's home country.
Normally, a tuition fee will be charged for enrolment in these educational programmes.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing: the "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't always need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the more caudalous lakes are large enough for any yacht, smaller vessels or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a recreational activity at national level in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same thing happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but, taking that out, it is quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the exclusive cruises through the Baltic Sea include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you have the opportunity to visit the historic city for a few days in full during your return journey, sleeping on the ship at night.
If you only disembark during excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany. However, as can be seen from the map above, this city is not near the sea and its visit is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can generate fear in people of any age and place, particularly if they have never been through the experience or if they have experienced a traumatic situation.
Do not feel ashamed of it: it is no different from other types of fears and personal problems that afflict so many others.
For some, understanding a little about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help to overcome a fear that stems from a lack of knowledge or a feeling of not having control.
Messenger companies are paid very well for speedy deliveries. Often time is of the essence when it comes to commercial documents, merchandise or urgent repairs.
The big companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for smaller companies and other routes.
If they shipped by air freight, on some routes they may have had to wait days for unloading and customs.
The only way to do it more quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations prohibit carrying baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or executive class on a plane is to spend a fortune on that privilege (or, better still, have your company pay for you).
But this has a price: in general, you can pay up to four times more for a business class ticket and up to eleven times more for a first class ticket.
Generally speaking, it's a waste of time looking for discounts on first class or business class seats on direct flights.
Airline companies are well aware that there is a basic group of travellers who are prepared to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and charging accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. Its regional language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldavia is a republic composed of many ethnicities, among which conflicts of that kind have arisen.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, to the east of Moldavia, which has its own government and currency, but which no UN member state recognises.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic links between the two parts of Moldavia have been re-established.
Orthodox Christianity is the largest religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third most important city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern commercial metropolis, evolved and busy, established around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The extensive boulevards as well as the buildings with mirrored facades and the avant-garde shopping centres are spattered with red tile roofs, the 18th century market and the old mosques and churches. Even so, their atmosphere is more like that of the Mediterranean than of traditional Turkey.
The people of Haldarsvík have excursions to the nearby island of Eysturoy and have an octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures in the shape of a dove on some graves.
It is worth spending half an hour walking around the fascinating village.
North and easy to reach is the romantic and hallucinating town of Sintra, which gained popularity among foreigners as a result of a vivid account that Byron made of its splendours.
In Scotturb, bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
He should also visit, to the north, the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Shrine) which is a place where there were apparitions of the Virgin Mary, famous throughout the world.
Do not forget that, basically, you are visiting a place that served as a common grave and is also a place of almost priceless significance to a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their stay in this place and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked there until their death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Give the place all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not spoil the place by making marks or graffiti on the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. Approximately half of its people prefer to speak Catalan, most people understand it and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, due to the fact that Catalan is, legally, the first official language, the majority of signs are written only in that language.
Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other buildings.
While the usual announcements in the Metro are only in Catalan, unplanned interruptions are made in a great variety of languages through an automatic programme in a great variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although it is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to have a good time in Paris is to behave as well as possible, like a well-mannered person (a well-bred person). This will make moving there much easier.
A few courtesies on your part will make the apparent brusqueness of Parisians disappear quickly.
The National Park of the Plitvice Lakes is very wooded, mainly with oaks, pines and spruces, and presents a vegetation between alpine and Mediterranean.
It has a wide and extraordinary range of plant communities, thanks to the variety of microclimates, soils and altitudes.
This region is also the home of a wide variety of animal and bird species.
The European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the badger, the wildcat and the pheasant, are some of the exotic animals, among many other ordinary creatures, that can be found in the place.
During a visit to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and may not show their shoulders.
While almost all the monasteries give coats to women who arrive unprepared, if you are wearing yours, especially if it is brightly coloured, the monk or nun will smile at you as you enter.
Following the same line, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the clothes available on entry, but these clothes are not washed after each person who uses them, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
The cuisine of Majorca, like that of other similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in all its recipes.
The Pa amb Oli is a popular and simple meal, especially in the summer. It is a bread with olive oil, tomato and any other ingredient such as cheese or tuna, among others.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie for 'you', always have their initial capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
It is a key method for distinguishing between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it simplifies reading, although its writing is somewhat complex, as one has to find out whether a verb or an adjective is used in the substantive form.
Speaking Italian is relatively easy, given that most of its words sound the same as they are written.
The c and the g are the letters to be most careful of, as they are pronounced differently depending on the vowel that follows.
Likewise, be sure to respect the difference in pronunciation of the r and the rr. For example, caro means expensive, while carro means car.
Persian has a relatively simple and regular grammar.
Therefore, the reading of this Persian grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammatical rules and achieve a better understanding of sentences.
It is not necessary to point out that, if you speak any Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish may arrive at the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and that it is unnecessary to study it individually.
Today, generally, premodern observatories have become obsolete and are functioning as museums or educational destinations.
Given that, in their heyday, light pollution was not a major problem as it is today, they are frequently found in cities or on campuses, being easier to access than those built in modern times.
The majority of current research telescopes are huge structures installed in remote areas with favourable weather conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, called hanami, is traditional in Japan since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the cherry blossom was the most prized.
It was the Emperor of Japan who organised the first cherry blossom festivals, only for himself and other members of the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take 'just one' specimen.
If you collect'specimens' during a visit to a formally organised garden, you will be thrown out without discussion.
Generally, Singapore is a very safe place to be and very easy to get around; you can buy almost any product on arrival.
But, due to its location in the "tropics high", a few degrees north of the equator, you will always have to deal with heat and, when the sky is clear, with strong sun, which happens less frequently.
In addition, some buses go to Hebron, to the north, which is the place where, according to the Bible, the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
He should confirm that the bus he is planning to board is going to Hebron and not just to Kiryat Arba, which is a Jewish neighbourhood close to that place.
Internal waterways can be a good theme for holidays.
For example, visiting castles in the valley of the Loire, the valley of the Rhine, taking a cruise to interesting destinations on the Danube, or boating on the Erie Canal.
They also limit popular hiking and cycling routes.
For the Christian religion, Christmas is one of its most important festivals, in which the birth of Jesus is celebrated.
Many of the traditions associated with this festival have also been adopted by people who are not Christians, both in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
It is tradition to spend Easter night in vigil in some exposed place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The more traditional churches usually offer a Paschal Vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend and, generally, the congregations begin their Easter celebrations as soon as midnight strikes.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because they were so far away from the continent, the mammals could not get there, which made the giant tortoise become the main grazer in the Galápagos.
Many mammal species have been introduced to Galápagos since man arrived on the archipelago, such as goats, horses and cattle, or rodents, dogs and cats.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Because the sky will be dark almost all day, this is a great opportunity to see the northern lights.
Thanks to the small population that lives in these regions and the fact that, as a result, there is usually no light pollution, you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the labour culture has a more vertical and formal structure than what westerners may be used to.
The typical clothing of the business world are suits and colleagues call each other by their surnames or by their jobs.
Harmony in the workplace is fundamental, where the emphasis is on the efforts of the group rather than on individual achievements.
Often, workers must get their superiors' approval for decisions and are expected to follow their instructions without question.
