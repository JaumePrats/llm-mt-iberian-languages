Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM, Welsh acronym) are concerned that they may appear "puppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP, for its English initials).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Member of Parliament said that his group was concerned that the issue would be &quot; left with Twp and Pwp &quot;.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that his group was &quot; unhappy &quot; and had suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member in Wales said that his group was &quot; open &quot; to a name change, but noted that the jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to that of the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed strong support for calling a Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the option MWP received the majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that the Members of the Assembly are suggesting alternatives, but the fight for consensus could scupper the bill, which should be sent to the Assembly President, Elin Jones, in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the operation of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members and the design of the committee system.
The Members of the Assembly will have the final say on how the names should be called when the Assembly is deliberating on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the name change of the country
Voters will be asked on Sunday whether the name of their country will change to &quot; Republic of Northern Macedonia &quot;.
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-old conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia &apos; s President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin &apos; s bells are silent for the difficulties of Harlem churches
Historically, the older people I have spoken to say that there was a pub and a church on every corner,
Today, there is neither one nor the other.
It was noted that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
Now people socialise in a different way, he says.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods that people visit regularly.
With regard to churches, he was concerned that the money raised from the sale of assets would not last as long as church leaders expected and that &quot; sooner or later, they would have to go back to square one &quot;.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment blocks full of the kind of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighbourhood.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, &quot; he said, &quot; and therefore they will accelerate the closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation disappeared in the 1930s.
A black congregation that was worshipping in a building acquired it.
A black congregation took over St. Martin &apos; s, under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black employees.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while the congregation of Father Johnson was planning for its reconstruction, they also ordered the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of the late Father Johnson in San Martin, called them "the poor man's campaigns".
In July, the expert playing the bell called it a &quot; cultural treasure &quot; and &quot; an irreplaceable historical instrument &quot;.
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first handbell choir in the world used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church handbell, a larger size, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the parish board, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was "trying to pass the costs" to the parish council, even though it had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tiger shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for abalone in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the opening day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon &apos; s Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about 30 minutes on Saturday morning when he heard the child calling for help, so he swam over with a group to rescue him.
Hammel said he initially thought he was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then realized he was "screaming that he had been bitten."
His collarbone was broken, Hammel said when he reached the boy.
Hammel said he had told everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark.
The child was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children &apos; s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The medic, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had upper torso injuries.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami s Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles said that there were more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury &apos; s beauty plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury &apos; s acquired Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff working on the aisles of their style and beauty stores.
In order to significantly boost the beauty market in the UK, valued at £28 billion and with growth outstripping that of fashion and homewares, the largest beauty halls in 11 stores across the country will be trialled this year, with a view to rolling out to more stores next year.
Beauty investment comes at the same time as this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury &apos; s declared that it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, there will be more space for existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges, with similar-looking zones to those in other stores, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range, with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will be trialling its concessions in two Sainsbury &apos; s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second of which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the move towards daily small-quantity food shopping in local stores are forcing supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury &apos; s, said that stores would increasingly resemble shopping centres as the supermarket chain tried to combat discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury &apos; s has integrated Argos discount stores into hundreds of its stores and introduced several Habitat stores since it acquired these chains two years ago. It is believed that this has driven food sales and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury &apos; s tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over how to split the profits from the pharmacy sales in its supermarkets.
The new strategy is being developed following the sale of 281 Sainsbury &apos; s pharmaceutical outlets to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury &apos; s, said: &quot; We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand portfolio is designed to meet all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, stormed off after Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to devote to the fashion and accessory brand Truly.
This business had compared favourably with Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter of This Morning, aged 37, announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the girl of gold from television admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for her Truly fashion and accessories brand.
The business had been compared to Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow and was seen as a favourite to double Willoughby &apos; s fortune, which was estimated at £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: &quot; Truly, Holly was the main priority.
It was to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved totally stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters, ready to be sold.
Experts believe the departure of This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and potentially delay the launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby established Truly in 2016 with Capp as CEO and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on holiday together and Jones had a 40 per cent share in Baldwin &apos; s television production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV &apos; s I &apos; m A Celebrity.
A close source to Jones said last night &quot; there was no talk of business &quot;.
A difficult conversation &quot; and then we fell in love &quot;
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some might consider &quot; unpresidential &quot; and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his mocking voice of a "news presenter".
I have not given up.
He said Kim was interested in meeting him again after Trump had praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he saw as a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the North Korean chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country had not seen an "appropriate response" from the United States to the first steps towards disarmament of North Korea.
He said, however, that the United States continued to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump &apos; s speech was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
He said he was doing very well with North Korea.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
We now have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach to the relationship with Kim by speaking of the relations.
It is very easy to be president, but then, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stadium, we would have 200 people right here, he said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, it was reported to foreign NGOs that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for international assistance to be mobilized.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a little.
Save the Children is preparing a team to go to Palu, but they are still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organizations could provide assistance.
Given that Indonesia is a country where the earth is constantly moving, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even if there had been a warning, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, travelling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading for Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia &apos; s dilapidated infrastructure the central theme of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to road and railway construction.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who is facing re-election next year.
It must also deal with the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, scores against Chelsea
Liverpool salvaged a Premier League draw at Chelsea with Daniel Sturridge &apos; s 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a Shaqiri pass from 27 yards out with the score 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot and kicked it to the second post.
The action took him over the area and towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
He was trying to get into that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible, he said on Liverpoolfc.com.
I saw Kante coming and I gave him a little tap. I didn't think too much about it, I just let it go.
Chelsea were winning 1-0 at half-time after Belgium star Eden Hazard had scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues &apos; pass to Mateo Kovacic was a toe-poke in that play, before he turned and dribbled into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle of the field.
Then he made a lovely pass into space that took Hazard into the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished with a left-footed shot that Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not stop.
Liverpool v Napoli, Champions League group stage, Wednesday 15:00, Stadio San Paolo, Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 BST in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the Indonesian disaster agency at 1 a.m. on Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves up to six metres high, according to the spokesman of the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, during a press briefing.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested by police as a suspect in the murder of a woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, resulting in the arrest of a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area to report anything they have seen or heard to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
In addition, I would recommend to any person, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.
A Police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
Some people who believed they knew the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are in the process of informing the family of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was left speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now being allowed back in.
Someone heard an agent telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
He keeps repeating "it is terrible".
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents were standing inside the cordon, controlling the block of flats.
Any person with information should contact the Merseyside Police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, reference 247 on 30 September.
The statue of Oliver Cromwell in Parliament Square becomes the last successful commemoration of "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be a poetic act of justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects and artefacts in England carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick &apos; s suggestions as &quot; crazy &quot; and an attempt to &quot; rewrite history &quot;.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell would be removed from the Palace of Westminster."
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
It may be that the wrong Cromwell is sacrificed to the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft Cromwell is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century and to part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: &quot; Many people see Cromwell, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
If it is a completely accurate description, then it is a matter for historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has given shape to the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”.
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery severed and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines in a pen in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
It seems that he travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a nearby pigsty door was open.
He said that there was a big pig with blood in its mouth in the pigsty.
The post-mortem examination confirmed that the pig weighing almost 250 kilograms had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
My cousin &apos; s legs were bloodied and mangled, he said, to The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera images showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it attacking anyone else, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan &apos; s family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it away.
After pigs in Oregon ate a farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "dispenser."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious - their intention is not to hurt.
What is needed is to treat them with the respect they deserve”, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rainfall across the south-west United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters along the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa caused gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday morning (5 a.m. local time) to Monday morning (local time), and was located about 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressure systems are starting to develop in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rainfall towards the north-east, towards the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will leave more than 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical rain band collides with the approaching low-pressure system, widespread heavy rain will occur in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 cm of rain will cause sudden flash floods, debris flows and possible desert landslides.
Heavy tropical rains will cause rainfall rates of almost 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in the greater part of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain, flash floods may occur suddenly with conditions that rapidly deteriorate.
Due to the threat of torrential tropical rains, it is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms could cause localized winds and dust clouds.
The approaching low pressure systems will bring heavy rains to specific areas of the southern California coast.
Heavy rains may leave up to two inches of water, which could cause small debris flows and make roads slippery.
This would be the first heavy rain of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before widespread rain arrives late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will continue in the Four Corners area on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes will be observed in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warming of the tropics.
Sometimes, this means drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the whole of the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the long-lasting heat of the summer will attempt to recover and expand again.
In most of the central and eastern United States, a warm start is expected in October, with temperatures generally in the 26 degree Fahrenheit range from the southern Great Plains to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could see temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term outlook indicates above-average chances for temperatures to be above normal in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which he denied, in six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, policy remained stalled and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest developments from Friday: a deal crafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake to have the FBI conduct a week &apos; s investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had groped her while she was drunk and that he had tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 per cent sure that that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who Nielsen reported on Friday have seen it.
The company reported the average audience for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other channels that carried the speech, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has some problems in calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is a hearing similar to that of a playoff game in American football or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have strongly supported Kavanaugh &apos; s nomination, led the cable leader, with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had $3.1 billion, NBC had $2.94 billion, MSNBC had $2.89 billion and CNN had $2.52 billion.
After the appearance, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday &apos; s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras captured protesters yelling at Kavanaugh as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing.
As he was being berated, live on CNN, he looked dejected.
Looking me in the face, a woman said,
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
She continued: &quot; You have power when there are so many women who do not have it. &quot;
Mr. Flake said that his office had issued a press release and, before the doors of the elevator closed, that he would have more to say in his appearance before the Committee.
Cable and broadcast networks were airing everything live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to recommend Kavanaugh for the Senate to vote on.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the following week, which some Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part by conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake &apos; s decision was critical, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of "playing politics"
Theresa May, the Prime Minister, accused her critics of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham (United Kingdom) on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside hers on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to share customs duties was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde murder: Dyteon Simpson arrested as suspect in LSU player &apos; s death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder by the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson &apos; s DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, the police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A bond of $350,000 has been posted, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head that had traveled to the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU &apos; s director of athletics, thanked the police in the area for their &quot; diligence and pursuit of justice &quot;.
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game during the last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "in shock" by the death of Wayde Sims.
These are the things that people always worry about, Wade said.
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
Ash from Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to keep away from the volcano after it showed signs of activity and emitted 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre was shaken by several tremors and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, 72 km south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after clashes between anti-riot police and pro-independence protesters during a demonstration coinciding with the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists hurled eggs and powder paint at the riot police, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are normally full of tourists.
There were also confrontations later in the evening and the police used truncheons to quell the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans such as "no forgiveness, no forgetting", clashed with unionist demonstrators shouting "Long live Spain".
Four people were treated for light injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatist Catalans celebrated.
The voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the turnout was low, as those opposed to secession boycotted the referendum in large numbers.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent voting at polling stations throughout the region, where violent clashes took place.
The independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a show of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” she said.
Despite a narrow victory in December 2009 regional elections, the pro-autonomy parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in detention, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
He said that the situation was becoming increasingly tense.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be standing in the European Parliament elections next year.
To stand for the European elections was the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government.
Londonderry: men arrested for crashing a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly driving a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday at approximately 19:30 on Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that there had been damage to the access and to the building itself.
It is possible that the car was shot at with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga &apos; s first goal for Livingston ensured victory
A Livingston promoted to impress Rangers by securing Steven Gerrard &apos; s second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga &apos; s attack made the difference. Gary Holt &apos; s team went up a place, with Hibs in second place.
This season, Gerrard &apos; s team have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table by eight points.
Before that, Rangers play Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their winning run in the division to six games. Manager Kenny Miller has yet to taste defeat since taking over from Kenny Shiels in October.
Livingston lets a chance pass against a determined opponent
Holt &apos; s team should have been a step ahead much earlier, causing all sorts of problems for Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence but failed to score from the penalty spot. Alan Lithgow then saw a shot deflected off Alan Hutton after he had gone in for a header and Craig Halkett scored from a Craig Beattie cross.
The home team was happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-retention play.
That was how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave them a free-kick and Livingston tried to get a shot in, with a combined play from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that point Rangers were in control of the ball but were unable to break down the home defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was looking pretty relaxed.
That game continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stoppage.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor turned away a Scott Pittman shot with his foot and Livingston were unable to get close to another Livingston goal.
In the Livingston area long passes were constantly being played, but they were always cleared. Two penalty appeals were turned down, one after Halkett &apos; s substitution of Glenn Middleton for the injured Kevin Kyle and the other after a handball.
Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous view is that they played a great game that continued to exceed expectations on a rising trajectory.
His style of play and his squad have hardly changed since his appointment, but this is largely down to Holt, who has strengthened the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was immense and marshalled a superbly organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good times with Gerrard, they came up short.
They failed to execute their plays, as they only managed to penetrate the opposition's half once, which is a warning to Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, smiles and a blue sky were on offer at the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey &apos; s EU membership.
Then, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers gathered in the vicinity to see their president.
Opposition to Erdogan was also voiced by hundreds of opponents, many of them Kurds, who condemned both Erdogan &apos; s policies and the German government &apos; s decision to welcome him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German-Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at about 10.15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by the paramedics, but died there and then.
The accident occurred after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the scene of Saturday &apos; s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been blocked and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the Directorate of the prison.
The disturbances started at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 9.30 on Sunday and are still continuing.
A team of elite specialists (known as "Tornado") is dealing with the disturbances, involving eight inmates and affecting one wing.
The officers received first aid for facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the prison service commented: &quot; Specialist prison staff have been deployed to deal with the incident in progress at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in jail.”
Long Lartin prison, which holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, prison officers were requested to attend the prison to deal with a serious disturbance involving attacks on prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen early next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern Nevada, eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain behind on Monday.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix commented in a tweet that only 10 hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status over a 321-kilometre radius from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.”
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of torrential rainfall, which can reach 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be between 2 and 5 cm, with the possibility of up to 10 cm in isolated areas, in other parts of the southwest desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden floods, Rosa rains are a blessing, as the region is suffering from drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that part of these torrential rains will be beneficial due to the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering from extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will hit Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, which is still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 miles per hour, is 619 miles south-southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moving northward at 19 miles per hour.
The storm is running into cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected that the storm will intensify into a tropical storm by late Monday afternoon in Mexico.
Heavy rains are expected in some parts of Mexico, where there is a high risk of flooding.
Heavy rains are expected from Baja California to Sonora in the northwest, with the possibility of up to 25 centimetres, as reported by weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression. Later, it will move southward across Arizona into Utah by late Tuesday night.
The main danger to Rosa or her remains is the torrential downpours in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest United States.
These rains are expected to cause sudden and rapid flooding in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4.00pm on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he is &quot; stable &quot;.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area of Somerset that same night, according to Avon and Somerset Constabulary.
The agents have made an appeal to anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and the anger of the Democratic Party"
Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party, Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had &quot; suffered the meanness and the anger &quot; of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers, with emotion and vehemence.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, that day, "Americans saw the shrewdness, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our day, a lawyer with an impeccable record of service to the public.
The President made indirect references to Judge Kavanaugh &apos; s candidacy in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
We have five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not here, but I am running a race,
That is why I go from one place to another fighting for great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission of &quot; resistance and obstruction &quot;.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh &apos; s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a high-ranking Republican official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, number rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that ravaged the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in Palu city on Friday to celebrate a festival when waves of up to six metres high arrived in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When yesterday it was announced that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, by its Indonesian acronym) of Indonesia, at a press briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, and everything on land was destroyed, said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved at a speed of 800 km/h across the open sea before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and collapsed mosques.
Shelling continued to hit the coastal city of Tartous on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT, by its Indonesian acronym) reported in a press release that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
He added that the geography of the city, which is built on the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
As he said, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300-km stretch of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were &quot; totally paralysed &quot; and there was &quot; no information &quot; from Donggala, he said.
More than 300,000 people were living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
That is a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse, he said.
On Saturday, the agency was criticised for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man can be heard warning people on the street below that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in the vicinity of Palu, hampering the coordination of rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a planned visit to the evacuation centres in Paul on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is higher than 800.
That is very bad.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala had arrived safely in Palu, where staff were sheltering under tarpaulins in the garden of their offices, they had seen a devastating scene on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
She said she had seen many houses destroyed.
That is very bad.
Even as the relief assistance gears were being put into motion, some people were complaining that the movement of relief workers with experience to Palu was being prevented.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign funding, supplies and staffing can be used in a disaster area declared a national disaster area.
That has not yet happened.
It was still a disaster at the provincial level, said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the Government says it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international assistance, but that has not happened yet.
As night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing still had hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolate stories written by natural disasters.
A small child was rescued from a manhole on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, national team coach for Indonesia &apos; s paragliding team, had trained two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia in May.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel included Mr. Mandagi, his students.
For my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional baggage,
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the parapente community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a grey verification mark, not two blue ones.
I think that means the messages were not delivered, he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a cash reload at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, two armed robbers robbed a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a cash machine located in the centre of entertainment and was preparing to reload it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money intended for recharging."
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Any person with information on the identities of these individuals should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will now be known as Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time now, and that is the name of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before it appears on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to debut its new album, Yandhi.
It replaced Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance due to "emotional reasons", as the show's creator explained.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously stated that the word had religious significance for him.
I think it is the most used word in the Bible, which means 'you', " West said in early 2008 while discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
It means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &quot; which means &quot; I am you, you are me, &
He went from being Kanye, which means &quot; the only one &quot;, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without a hyphen.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Square that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the student movements of the left were becoming stronger throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing them with monthly stipends for those who study and by opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in AI, the US should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements by several parts of the U.S. Government, even though, in general, the United States lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China has submitted its plan last year: its goal is to become the number one in innovation in IAs by 2030.
Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the United States. We are looking to the next step in the field of I.A.
The doubling of funding means twice as many opportunities for the next great achievement in I.A. to be achieved in the United States, as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book &quot; AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order &quot; was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China &apos; s most important I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed a computer program that defeated the best American player of Othello. Subsequently, he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
He commended the previous technological competitions of the United States Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get Government funding, said Lee.
It is not China that is taking the academics; it is the corporations, Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent university researchers to work on I. A.
He said that changes in U.S. immigration policy could also help intensify U.S. efforts in I.A.
I think that doctors in I.A. should be given automatic permanent residency cards.
The State Council of China released its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds both individuals and institutions, as does the National Science Foundation of the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In early 2001, the Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic sectors. The White House also announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
As regards the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name will change to "Republic of Macedonia of the North", a gesture that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which had blocked its membership bid in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slav majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the minimum 50 per cent turnout required for the referendum to be valid will be achieved.
The referendum question was: &quot; Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece? &quot;
The proponents of a name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to enable Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
I have come here to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us, 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska from Skopie said.
Although it will not be legally binding, a number of Members have said that they will respect the result of the vote, which makes it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared at 1 p.m. that no irregularities had been reported.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, said: &quot; I am here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe. &quot;
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko Zaev cast their votes in the referendum on the name change of Macedonia, which would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and removing chairs from the tents of those who were boycotting the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needed, with its unemployment rate exceeding 20 per cent.
I believe that the majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO, Mr. Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that a positive outcome would be a &quot; confirmation of our future &quot;.
A survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Studies put the turnout at between 30 and 43 per cent, which is lower than the required 50 per cent.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV, Macedonia, revealed that 57 per cent of those polled intended to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, evades the entire Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart Brighton &apos; s defence to help Manchester City to a 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score in the 65th minute.
Argentina &apos; s Argentinian midfielder received a yellow card in the middle of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking into open play.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded a defender before beating several more in the Brighton area.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who struck it with his right foot to avoid Mathew Ryan with a shot that hit the right post.
City manager Pep Guardiola said Aguero had some problems with his foot.
We are talking about 55 to 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky to score at that moment.”
However, it was Sterling who gave City the initial advantage in the Premier League title race.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball very deep inside the Brighton territory.
He made a lovely ball to Leroy Sane on the left flank.
Sane gave him a few touches before sending him to the second mast.
The Sky Blues forward fired the ball into the net just before going off the field.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. CET at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to rain on the Rockies' parade
With the Nationals out of the playoff race, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to step on the mound Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who play the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies clinched at least one wild-card berth with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still chasing their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be energized and that the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I have faced this year.
Why would he not want to participate?
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but it appears they are leaning toward leaving Scherzer in that situation.
Scherzer, who will make his opening statement on Thursday, has had a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest period on Sunday.
The record of Washington &apos; s right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation, his selection for the Supreme Court, when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
In November, everything we have done is at stake.
We have five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is one of the most important. I do not stand, but I am a candidate, so I go from one place to another fighting for great candidates.
And he continued: &quot; We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, they are in power right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means necessary, and we see the meanness, the wickedness.
They do not care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control. And we are not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, were embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
He said, "We have seen that over the last four days." He said, "Democrats are furious, they are bad, horrible and false."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, nominating Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Does he filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, &quot; What? &quot; 
No, no mmm, I hope for a response. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.”
The Labour Party already covers a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour Members of Parliament who are told that we are not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague in the House of Commons, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment, categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, for Europe. It was ironic that Jeremy was in disagreement with leaders on issues on which he had previously disagreed.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, &quot; we want inclusive and productive meetings &quot;.
During the eight years that I have been a Member of the Labour Party local authority, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a &quot; more compassionate and merciful &quot; policy has long since been forgotten, if it was ever really implemented.
It is becoming increasingly clear that Labour is not a place for differing views and that each view is judged in terms of whether the party leadership considers it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to change his mind radically and take positions he had never previously agreed with, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, whatever I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the centre &apos; s policies, telling me that I shouldn &apos; t be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced this.
I am indeed fortunate in that my colleagues tend to make political comments about me.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a daily torrent of sexist or racist abuse, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that broad range of views, and with every censure motion or change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice to keep my head down and not make too much noise and that way I would be &quot; all right &quot;.
But I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, I have been motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my comprehensive school literally in ruins, and I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, and I did not do so in the last elections.
It is impossible that anyone in Nottingham East would not know my political positions and the areas where I disagreed with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday is that I do not understand this desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is hurtling towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or no political opportunism will stop me from acting in the way I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr invincible rise to the top
Two late tries may have decided the final outcome but, without doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Tennent &apos; s Premiership match.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make the most of opportunities, that gave the local team the victory, so the coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
He said: &quot; We have been tested in all the games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy about that.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: "Ayr deserves the recognition, they took their opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson &apos; s try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card shown to Rory Hughes, the Warriors &apos; loanee for the match, gave Melrose the advantage and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Climo extended the lead with a penalty. Just before half-time, he scored and converted a penalty, leaving the score at 17-5 in favour of the Ayr.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson &apos; s converted try, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long delay after Ruaridh Knott was taken off on a stretcher with a serious injury, and when the game resumed, Ayr went ahead with a Stafford McDowall try converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having one more man on the field for Bruce Colvine &apos; s last-gasp try, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
However, the locals recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card to please Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made a try when he was in the back of the maul going forward.
The weather converted him, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong after a kick and sent Gregor Henry to the bottom of the wing for the fifth shot at goal.
The Still Game star wants to steer his career towards the catering industry
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the catering business after it was revealed that he had been appointed manager of a chain of restaurants.
The actor, 56, is Jack Jarvis, who is the writer and co-star of the BBC's famous sketch show, which he writes and co-produces with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth series will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun claimed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming Glasgow restoration market".
Bolivia without a coastline: hopes that the court will reopen the Pacific route
Navy personnel guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases show the motto: &quot; The sea is ours by right, &quot;
It is a duty to recover it.
In all of Bolivia, a land without sea, the lost coast is still vividly remembered, as is the bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia is expecting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and calm, and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens set up throughout the country, hoping that the International Court of Justice will rule in favour of Bolivia &apos; s claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is locked in a controversial battle over re-election next year, also has much to say about the resolution adopted on Monday.
He said that we were very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the tribunal will rule in Bolivia &apos; s favour and that the situation would not change much if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice &apos; s resolution came only six months after the final submissions indicated that the case was &quot; not complicated &quot;, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have impeded it.
The problem of access to the sea had been seized by the current Bolivian administration, he said.
In addition, he suggested that Bolivian President Evo Morales &apos; s bellicose rhetoric had undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talking at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold conversations after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia &apos; s representative to the International Court of Justice, rejected the idea that the court &apos; s decision-making process was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia would be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and to end 139 years of mutual benefit", he said.
He also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
Bolivia would never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he said.
The resolution is an opportunity to see what we have to leave behind.
North Korea says it will not disarm unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never be the first to give up nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honour its commitments made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come as Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy talks that have been stalled for more than three months since this summit with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.
He said that the continuation of the sanctions and the United States &apos; opposition to a statement that would end the Korean War and submit North Korea were a &quot; fantasy &quot;.
Washington is wary of accepting the statement without North Korea taking some significant disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and the US President, Donald Trump, want to hold another summit.
However, there is a widespread scepticism about North Korea &apos; s seriousness in giving up its arsenal, which the country probably regards as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is expected to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
Paris fashion parades reveal the latest giant hats about to land on a street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a collection of eccentric large-size hats for their spring/summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the Paris Fashion Week style.
Instagram has been flooded with impossible hats this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino &apos; s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large items included pineapples with jewels, a wizard &apos; s hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of outrageous masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-on lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation recalled a complete scuba diving team, including a diver, a regulator and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you are in luck.
The haters of style predict that the huge hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
The big hats are coming in strong with &quot; La Bomba &quot;, with a straw hat with a 60-centimetre wing used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The brand behind this impractical hat that flooded social media presented another great creation on the catwalk: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini that she was wearing.
The Jacquemus orange-brown raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of the Jacquemus Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 Paris Fashion Week.
As stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: &quot;Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories.&quot;
John Edward: linguistic competencies are fundamental for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland have a long history of academic excellence, which has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the examinations, which is further enhanced by individual and collective success in the areas of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils in all of Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are striving to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools have as their aim to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they will occupy as citizens of the world.
As a sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages are still popular and in demand in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said, &quot; If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. &quot;
If you speak to him in his language, it reaches his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if one wants to establish relations and build trust with people from other countries, one cannot rely solely on English.
If we look at the results of this year &apos; s examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables, with the pass rates highest in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centres that make up the SCIS, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A in Chinese, 72 per cent in German, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages because they are seen as a fundamental competence that children and young people will need for sure in the future.
Languages are currently considered to be on the same level as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the independent school curriculum plans and in all schools.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, of the reasons given by employers for difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, linguistic skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential for language skills in the workplace is increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because of this competition, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will enable that person to automatically get ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. It was also found that French was the only language spoken by 15 per cent of the population.
That is why investing in language education today is important for children of today.
If children know several languages, especially those of developing economies, they will be better equipped to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools he or she will always be able to choose between several languages taught by specialist staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are totally committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children for life and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital role to play in the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be seen as &quot; communication languages &quot;.
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait for LeBron James &apos; s first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Luke Walton, the Lakers &apos; coach, announced that James would play in the season opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes is still to be determined.
Walton said on the Lakers &apos; official website that the number would be &quot; more than one and less than 48 &quot;.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers &apos; six-game preseason schedule.
He said: "In this stage of my career, I do not need pre-season friendlies to prepare."
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump campaign events scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump &apos; s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be viewed online?
Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Saturday, September 29, 2018.
It can be viewed online via a live YouTube stream.
It is likely that Trump will comment on this week &apos; s Kavanaugh hearings, which were tense due to sexual misconduct allegations and have left the Senate waiting for a vote on confirmation for at least a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans facing the November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, the Trump campaign signaled that the five rallies next week are intended to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House," according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we are in the campaign, said a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be identified.
The rally tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage in Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 per cent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is falling behind in the polls.
For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has to come in and give him a push in the polls, Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the United States team shows that it is willing to fight to keep the hope alive for the individual matches on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept in sport, but the players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
So where do you think the impetus is now?
Jordan Spieth said: &quot; We were six points down and now we are four points down, so I guess that is a little bit of a push. &quot;
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with 12 more points at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have something going for them and plenty of reasons to be optimistic, among them the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and earned four points together.
Spieth has been lethal off the tee and preaches by example.
The guttural roars of celebration grew louder as the pair rounded the turn, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth round when they were two down after two holes.
The putt that the Americans gave them on the 15th was greeted with a similar cry, one that conveyed the belief that the Americans were not yet out of it.
What is needed is to redouble efforts and focus on the game, said Spieth.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable couple of Europe have won four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
Moliwood was the only pair to not record a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That run and the way their energy flows with the noisy crowd on Sunday make it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning, after teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help on Sunday to get out of the holes.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch because you can see the interaction between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they do not give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the final day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team is willing to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leads by a good margin on the final day of the Ryder Cup, after the fourballs and foursomes had ended with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two wins over a Tiger Woods who was in trouble, moving four points clear in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a US team that made many errors in the morning foursomes, which ended 3-1.
The United States was more stubborn in the foursomes, winning two matches, but failed to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent partnership helped them to beat a dejected Woods and a rookie American Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who had not shone too brightly in the two Saturday matches, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning foursomes, returned as Henrik Stenson &apos; s partner in the afternoon foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world &apos; s number one and number three players respectively, by a score of 2-1.
Although the weather was pleasant and calm in the southwest of Paris, Europe was not having all its own way.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three times, and Justin Thomas, who has two points, served as role models for the Americans, who earned two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2&apos; 1 victory over Ian Poulter and Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&apos; 3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has recovered from a four-point deficit in the singles only twice, but Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a tie to retain it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is "no possibility" of unilateral disarmament unless it has confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of the DPRK informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the international organization that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" in the past year, including halting nuclear tests and missile launches, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received a similar response from the United States,” he said.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of unilateral disarmament.
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea about Washington &apos; s resistance to a &quot; phased &quot; denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea has done in the past.
He referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an American president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un committed to work towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can be trusted.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States has insisted on nuclear disarmament first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a statement of termination of the war.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.
It made no mention of a second Trump-Kim summit, announced with great fanfare by the US President at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of the Republic of Korea, in the past five months, and added: "If the Republic of Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Ri &apos; s tone in this year &apos; s speech was radically different from last year &apos; s speech to the United Nations, when he said that it was inevitable that missiles from North Korea would be directed at U.S. soil after President Trump &apos; s suicidal mission to call Kim Jong-un &quot; rocket man &quot;.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to &quot; totally destroy &quot; North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in advancing towards disarmament, but said there was still much to do and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Security Council on Thursday, &quot; The imposition of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without non-compliance until we realize a fully verifiable and irreversible denuclearization &quot;.
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes.
Pompeo chatted with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang in a month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea had denounced its "demands as those of a gangster".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantling a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all students are now sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of all-night studying fuelled by caffeine.
A teacher discovered that students at the number one university in the world often had no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was just finding out about this now, in her final year.
He said that no one had ever spoken to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university &apos; s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping very little during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section has a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sporting performance and the importance of establishing a routine for going to bed.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that it is not going to change the behaviour of students immediately.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as any one has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride in &quot; staying up all night &quot; still existed and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good night &apos; s sleep should be &quot; the secret weapon &quot; of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
It was noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
She hoped that the next step would be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar programme of study before joining the competitive institution.
The recommendation of Professor Czeisler is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by computer screens and LED lights, which can alter circadian rhythms, so that they will have problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga goal sinks Gerrard men
Rangers suffered another away-day depression when the Dolly Menga-inspired Livingston defeat left Steven Gerrard &apos; s disjointed team on the brink of relegation.
Rangers wanted their first away win since February 4 &apos; s 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt &apos; s team beat them for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Hearts, who lead the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga &apos; s attack came just before half-time and Rangers &apos; lacklustre formation was never going to be enough.
Now Rangers drop to sixth, Livingston move up to third, behind Hibs by goal difference.
The Rangers may have more problems, as referee Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance after allegedly being hit by an object from the visiting team bench.
Gerrard changed eight of the winning team against Ayr, reaching the Scottish Cup semi-finals.
Holt, meanwhile, had taken 11 players from Livingston who had won a point against Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his well-organised team had dominated the opposition throughout.
Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have been booked at two minutes into the game when Menga made a pass into space for Scott Pittman, which went between the defence, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her off.
Keaghan Jacobs made a try in the deep for captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only kick it out on the long side.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction in their play in the third period.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the game when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian Morelos &apos; s request.
Rangers had two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly was hardly troubled by Lassana Coulibaly &apos; s header and Ovie Ejaria &apos; s tame effort.
Although Livingston &apos; s goal in the 34th minute came against the run of play, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, the Rangers could not cope with a deep pass from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed the ball to Menga to score.
In the break, Gerard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the winger fed Morelos, but Kelly, a towering presence, blocked his path.
However, Livingston continued to lead the visitors exactly to the type of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing the way with long passes.
Holt could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed home a corner that did not go in.
The Rangers substitute, Glen Middleton, claimed a penalty in the dying seconds of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the &quot; Sunday Morning &quot; Almanac, 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and COUNTING... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm &quot; Hans &quot; Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film &quot; The Bells of Coronado &quot;, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the apparently incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium."
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity emitted by the minerals”.
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But his invention lives on.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can &quot; see &quot; a common protein in many cancers and re-inject them.
A vaccine trial is showing promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein found in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes growth of different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West went on a rant in favour of Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It did not work out well.
Kanye West was jeered on Saturday Night Live after a shaky performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I talk to white people all the time and they ask me how I can like Trump when he is racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the tape was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted the audio of West &apos; s rant on social media.
It was not clear whether Rock was ridiculing West with the publication.
In addition, West told the audience that he had had a hard time on stage because he was wearing the hat.
They attacked me.
They told me not to wear my hat.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I am asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: &quot; Do you want to see me asleep? &quot; and added that he was &quot; going to put on his cape of invincibility, because that meant that nobody could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward? &quot;
Try with love.
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and Variety reported that SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to one person who spoke to the magazine.
West had been invited to replace Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died recently.
West confounded many when she came on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier singing I Love it.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP TO THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was &quot; just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful &quot;.
But I decide not to reward someone (buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) whom I believe is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He is free.
We also”, he added.
Before the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now &quot; the person formerly known as Kanye West &quot;.
It is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as P Diddy, Puffy and Puff Daddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, without forgetting the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates &apos; Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the male hero stereotype, saying that those roles on screen often transmitted to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something had gone wrong and asked how to tackle toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he thought it was "fairly important" to address the issue.
I think it is quite important at this moment, "Where have we gone wrong with masculinity?", she said.
What have we been teaching men as they grow up, thinking of the problems that we see now?
Kit believes that television has a part to play in the rise of toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on television and in the street that makes young people feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people”.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any Game of Thrones spin-offs when the series ends next summer, saying he was "tired of battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard &apos; s play about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
He recently revealed that he believes knowing his wife Rose is the best thing he has taken away from Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, I have given my future family and my life from now on.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit Harington &apos; s character Jon Snow in the fantasy series that won Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm in the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 per cent more new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were notified.
Most of these cases were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had declined in total, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB community suffers from much discrimination.
Because of the country &apos; s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the failure to use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV/AIDS drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data on Republican senators and says the allegations are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the House of Representatives, criticized on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages on legislators.
The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles said the allegations were being pushed by right-wing commentators and websites.
Waters tweeted: &quot; Lies, lies and more despicable lies &quot;.
The information published allegedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of United States Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted the information on the Internet during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address associated with the publication was linked to Waters &apos; office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie”, she continued.
The member of my staff whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations was not responsible for the leak of this information.
This allegation is completely false and a complete lie.”
Waters &apos; statement was met with immediate criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
He denied the report with anger, writing, &quot; This is false. &quot;
This suggests that the necessary temperance to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
Do not rebel.
The prosecutor should not be questioned on his motives.
He should remain calm and composed.
It seemed that Fleischer was trying to compare Waters &apos; reaction to the Kavanaugh hearing with the Democrats &apos; criticism of Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during his Thursday hearing.
Republican Omar Navarro, who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
If that is true, it is very serious indeed, he tweeted.
In his statement, Mr. Waters said that his office had alerted "relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations."
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally accountable for these destructive and dangerous actions against all my staff members.
Johnny English: Again in Action. Rowan Atkinson &apos; s spoof spy is short of its mark
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new British film. It seems to be what is expected of this new Johnny English franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this ironic self-satire be the new export opportunity for our country?
Johnny English, the incompetent, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his licence to cock up again. Just his name gives clues that this is a comedy aimed at territories where English is not the first language.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent, despite his strange claims to waste glamour, who has a little of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that type who touched only one note in the Carrefour de feu ceremony at the opening of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, it was based on the mysterious man traveller and international figure that Atkinson had represented years ago in the Barclaycard television advertisements, causing chaos in its wake.
There are one or two good moments in this last delivery.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armour as the rotors hit the hull.
Atkinson &apos; s gift for physical comedy is obvious, but the humour is somewhat lacking and is particularly superfluous now that franchises such as James Bond and Mission: Impossible are adding comic ingredients without problems.
The humour seems more aimed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English &apos; s absurd adventures are not as clever and well-judged as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now the repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in deep trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated Britain &apos; s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent in the field, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the straw that breaks the camel &apos; s back for the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered character who is watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this role, almost as if she were Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to rely on one of those who is retired.
That is the bumbling Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh private school, but gives clandestine lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy school like the one in Rock School.
Whitehall is moved to an urgent meeting and meets his old pal Bough, now represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married submariner, a role that Vicki Pepperdine does not exploit enough.
Thus, the terrible Batman and Robin of the Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic billionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain &apos; s IT problems: sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; English also becomes pure anarchy when he tries to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta &apos; s house by using a virtual reality helmet.
Undoubtedly, they were used to the full in the last sequence, but, however graceful and noisy it may be, the whole still conveys a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I could not help but wonder whether the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan to make Britons work four days a week and be paid for five
The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn is going to think about a radical plan whereby Britons would work four days a week but be paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the owners of companies to allocate the savings from the AI revolution to workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same salary.
According to sources, the idea &quot; fit &quot; into the party &apos; s economic and economic agenda, and would tilt the country towards the workers.
This change to a four-day week has been supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way of workers making the most of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party figure told The Sunday Times: We are expecting a review of the directive before the end of the year.
It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day working week is a definite issue that the party hopes to incorporate into its strategy to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in its overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at present not all of the Labour Party is in favour of this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: &quot; The four-day week is not party policy and is not going to be discussed at this time. &quot;
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was prepared to recover powers of &quot; anonymous directors &quot; and &quot; vested interests &quot; in companies providing public services.
One of the shadow minister &apos; s plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders in water companies will not get back all their shares, because a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to the irregularities perceived.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10 per cent of shares in private sector companies would be allocated to employees, which would yield annual dividends of up to £500.
Graham and Kennedy talk about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh on 60 Minutes
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has at least delayed by a week the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice, and raised the question of whether the results of the investigation could influence any Republican senator who ultimately decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes'Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
Of course, Kennedy said.
I was in favour of going ahead with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out and I asked him: &quot; Did you do it? &quot;
He was firm, resolute, determined."
Graham &apos; s vote, however, appears to be immovable.
I have already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the allegations.
Mr. Graham: "Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it tersely."
And none of the people she named has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival that brings together an impressive roster of stars in support of an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in our lifetime.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park &apos; s Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be reminded of the real purpose of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
If you want a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or &quot; actions, &quot; such as volunteering, sending emails to a global leader, making a phone call or any other activity that helps to raise awareness of your goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years since it was founded?
Is the idea of a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just another form of "clicktivism", which is the name given to the position we adopt when we believe we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million &quot; actions &quot; by its supporters in favour of a large number of different objectives.
Through these actions, they claim to have helped secure commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
By early 2018, the group had cited 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from its actions, of which $10 billion had already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based investor and implementer partnership, united in the common goal of "helping children grow and reach their full potential". To this end, $35 million has been pledged to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens partners.
Thanks to the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and partners such as you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition”, said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd at a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions asked on their website about what we think can be done to alleviate extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: &quot;It will be a long and hard road, and we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already shown, we will achieve our goals because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we have lined up for this year &apos; s New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out the energy export blockade of Russia - Department of the Interior
In case necessary, Washington could resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up markets, including the Middle East, according to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia &apos; s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates on behalf of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier of Europe.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and means of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the consumer voice in energy in the United States."
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternatives in Iran and Russia basically consist of exploiting and replacing fuels, he said, adding that Russia is good at only one thing, and that is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made at a time when the Trump administration has been trying to push liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted throughout that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
Kremlin spokesmen have defended the fierce opposition of Washington to the project as being solely economic and a further example of unfair competition.
I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, in Moscow in September 2015.
The United States position has, however, been met with German rejection, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU &apos; s energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider running for president in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Holyoke City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women among our leaders, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider the possibility of standing for the presidency.
Warren gave her opinion on President Donald Trump during a visit to the Town Hall and said he was &quot; taking the country down the wrong path &quot;.
She said: &quot; I really worry about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from Friday, Warren said, &quot; It is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote. &quot;
A poll was released on Thursday, however, a majority of Warren &apos; s own voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
A 58 per cent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
A 32 per cent of those polled supported his candidacy, however.
In the survey, support for former Governor Deval Patrick increased to 38 per cent, with 48 per cent against.
Other members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2020.
Biden said he would make a decision in January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin &apos; s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
The situation that my son is going through, everything that has happened to him since he came back, you know very well the other families that are suffering from the effects of the TEPT and other wounds that our soldiers come back with, &quot; she said at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the &quot; great taboo &quot; that nobody wanted to talk about, and commented on her son and other veterans of war who &quot; come home with a different attitude, hardened, wondering whether there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the armed forces, have given to their country. &quot;
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on a domestic violence charge that interfered with a domestic violence complaint and a weapons charge under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial challenge to the new US policy that denies asylum to domestic violence or gang victims.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia sent a "friendly letter" to Washington on Friday to show their support for a refugee applicant who is currently facing the current directive, according to NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed by the ACLU in August 2009, was not revealed.
He said that his friend "and his children, who are members of a violent gang", abused her, but U.S. officials denied his asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states, who defended Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the United States, as countries facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gang violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States reversed a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA, for its English initials) that allowed undocumented domestic violence victims to seek asylum in this country.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, made remarks on Friday in which he said that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal asylum law, all asylum applications must be decided on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the application and this exception violates that principle, the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also wrote that the policy denying entry to immigrants hurts the U.S. economy by asserting that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and that they are a "needed workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to deny asylum to domestic violence and gang violence victims.
Asylum seekers can be granted asylum if they leave their countries of origin because of persecution or threats on account of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
Asylum was never created as a panacea to address all problems, even all serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll rises in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming ever more perilous.
The situation is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby at a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce".
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for whatever belongings they can salvage in a desperate attempt to recover what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building due to the continuing aftershocks, which were also very strong.
I could not help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to take cover.
I was trapped in the rubble, I think," Haris told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I don't know what has happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well.
The US Ambassador accused China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
One week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper touting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely circulated newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 elections in the United States, which China denies.
Trump &apos; s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence U.S. elections marked a new phase in a growing U.S. campaign to pressure China, according to U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
While it is common for foreign governments to publicize their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led both sides to raise tariffs on imports from each other.
The countervailing duties imposed by China at the beginning of the trade war were designed to fall on exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesspeople.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China &apos; s &quot; intensifying &quot; this pressure by placing advertisements in our free press.
To spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by attempting to place a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register.
Instead, in the newsstand in Beijing where we are now, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the wide range of views that people in China can have on the worrying trajectory that their economy is taking, because the media are controlled by the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said that one of the most important newspapers in China had declined to publish the article, but did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm election with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are now rallying behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash could occur, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and many Republicans have said they want to move forward with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University, told The Hill that "you can't go back" on these issues.
Reeher said he doubted that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters who are upset about this issue.
Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget tomorrow, or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters outside the Senate chanting &quot; November is coming! &quot; (November is coming soon!) as the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh &apos; s nomination, according to Mic.
Democrats &apos; enthusiasm and motivation are off the charts, said non-partisan political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, who writes for Roll Call.
People say that the impact is already very significant, and that is indeed the case.
But it could be even greater, especially among indecisive women from the outskirts of the cities and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote, even though they do not like the president."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, who detailed her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee in great detail, analysts had indicated that a backslide was possible if Republicans continued to push ahead with the confirmation.
This has become a big mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as reported by NBC News early last week.
It is no longer just a question of the committee vote and the final vote, nor even whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench; it is also about how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic election-eve group.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know whom to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who are on Kavanaugh &apos; s side.
In a new YouGov poll, 41 per cent of respondents said they believed Ford &apos; s testimony, while 35 per cent said they believed Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony.
In addition, 38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30 per cent said the same of Ford.
After Flake &apos; s push, the FBI is now investigating Ford &apos; s statements, as well as at least those of another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her when she was 17 years old while drunk.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last of the technology legend. A company that is based on the open-source platform Solid of Tim Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "to dominate the world."
It has to be now," he said of the startup.
It is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create their own &quot; personal data locker &quot; or POD.
It may contain lists, lists of pending tasks, the calendar, the music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique to online personal data storage is that the user is the one who decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it &quot; personal development through data &quot;.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company &apos; s director general, John Bruce, is to integrate resources, processes and skills so that Solid can reach everyone.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform IBM bought, some of the in-house developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about whether a "radical change" was going to be introduced, where all their business models would be completely changed overnight.
We are not going to ask for permission.
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt, "Its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on network neutrality.
Even as Berners-Lee launches Inrupt, he will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "a very symbolic thing" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the medal.
According to the London Gazette, 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense mist and under intense machine-gun and artillery fire".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the greatest courage, advanced the line before reaching a single-barrelled gun and knocking out three of the detachment.
The Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather &apos; s actions were &quot; so great that I will never be able to reach that level, but they were very instructive.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which was accompanied by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is apparent when he is shown such widespread support".
MMA followers were up all night for Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig
Imagine that he stays up all night to watch Bellator 206 so that at the end they don &apos; t let him see the main event.
The San José poster featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was going to be broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. -- just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face off -- the UK viewers were left stunned when the programme suddenly changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as &quot; a heavy joke &quot;.
There is government regulation of what is broadcast after 6 a.m. and that was not appropriate, so they had to change the programming to children.
""Peppa the pig", yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would be changing the format to include British viewers in future editions.
When I think of the option of a live broadcast, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it is at 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are working on it.
I can assure you that when the programme was changed, we received a great deal of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We are trying to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise you that it will not happen again.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which is what we normally do. We tried to give more than usual to the fans, and we went over.
That is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he felt inferior because of his sexuality, but that was what drove him to become a champion.
At 24, he told us that he did not realize that not everyone was like him until he went to secondary school.
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that her intention in talking about gay rights was to &quot; transmit hope &quot; to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to downplay the importance of winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this legendary programme, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first Daley programme, Daley himself was shown as a marginalised person, saying that he had felt inferior to others during his childhood because &quot; it was not socially acceptable to like children and girls &quot;.
She said: &quot; Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so he did not disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games held in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had told his story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass on that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that for him, too, it was a surprise to fall in love with a man, the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar-winning winner, who is 20 years his senior, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
When you live so much from such a young age (she was 14 when she competed in her first Olympics and her father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone your age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have been about 'I have to win a gold medal',
But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without doubt, Robbie."
His son is called Robert, after his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was whether they had the London 2012 tickets, because he wanted to be in the front row.
I was not able to say no to him, he was in the first row.
He had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it was only at that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This was also the inspiration behind his first song choice, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him during the preparation for the Olympic Games. He still gets goose bumps when he hears it.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad statistic.
Mickelson, who was playing in the biennial event to try to break a record for the 12th time, was replaced by Furyk for the Saturday foursomes and fourballs.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the five-time major champion had to cheer on his team at times and, at others, try to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what ails him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is never in his best shape for the long rough at Le Golf National, where errant shots are punished continually.
And, if the field is not sufficiently discouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, had started in such an impressive fashion, Mickelson &apos; s match might have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, and could not say much more.
He understood perfectly the role he had today, he gave me a pat on the back and, wrapping his arm around me, said he would be ready tomorrow.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that is how it came out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo &apos; s record of most matches played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could be the last of a long line of Ryder Cups that had never been so clearly defined by the individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He is fun, sarcastic, clever, he likes to mock others; he is a genius to have on the team.
I think the younger players have enjoyed having him as a support, and this week as well; it was fun.
It is much more than just a game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, even with a substantial advantage in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
Danish debut was in 1997 at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros &apos; s team led by 5 points over the Americans, but in the end only managed to finish with their tails between their legs by a minimum margin, winning 14 1/2-13 1/2.
You keep reminding me that we had a great tournament at Valderrama, we also had a great tournament at Brookline and we lost, we had a great tournament at Valderrama and we won, but by a whisker", said Bjorn, pictured, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead by a 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and the world that that team is not finished.
You have to give it everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This is not over until the points are on the board.
We have a target to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on our 12 players, but we are very aware of what is on the other side, where they are, and that they have the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players had achieved on a very difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to go too far ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What is happening tomorrow is individual action and that is different.
It is great to share the good times with a partner, but when things are not going well, you are really tested as a golfer.
That is the message that we have to get across to the players, to give their best tomorrow.
Now it is time to leave your partner and go and get the best out of yourself.
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as a team, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who combined for four points.
Furyk has been on both ends of the spectrum in the last few days of those great tournaments and was part of the team that won at Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle of Medinah."
He remembered every word, he said, when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had motivated his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-importants tomorrow, but we have to play as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all move in the same direction, all the pressure falls on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole trip," said Bjorn.
The new German warship, again postponed
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era vessels, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class of frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report by the German newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery delayed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class frigates requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-missile technology, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures that are very small.
Among other important features are longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed up to two years away from the home ports.
However, the constant delays have resulted in the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the world) being already outdated when they start to serve, as Zeit points out.
The unfortunate F125 frigate took up the post last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the idea of putting the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that a ship had been returned to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "critical software and hardware defects" that would render the vessel almost useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class frigates will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half the crew of the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also noted that the ship had an excessive weight, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy &apos; s ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as other similar German ships used in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the overall project cost, including training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is estimated that the cost has reached 3,100 million euros (3,600 million dollars), instead of the initial 2,200 million euros.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular significance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of the German navy.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy was "losing ships capable of deploying".
The official said that the problem had become worse over time, because old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new research, carried out in the Highlands of Scotland, is trying to find out how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that all that is discovered will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelles, as well as Daubenton's and long-eared bats from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at strategic locations on the property to monitor bat activity during the season.
The NHS volunteers and the mobile survey team will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds recorded on the tapes will reveal the frequency of calls by bats and the species making them.
A report and map of the habitat will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, is hoping that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be managed for bats and other associated species.
Scotland and the United Kingdom have experienced significant declines in bat populations over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects their nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and electrical cabling can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind,
They are nocturnal hunters and their ears are more useful than their eyes in achieving their objective.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescues.
The organisation has even opened the first and only Scottish bat reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish bat.
The property manager, David Thompson, said it was the ideal territory for them.
Here, in Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and the right habitat.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats, so the work we are doing here and on other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop."
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before undertaking maintenance work within the property, as it is possible to destroy a breeding colony unintentionally and 400 females and young could be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved.
He said: &quot; We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species on which we do not know how their populations evolve. &quot;
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations as "fake news" and said people were "using my name to get attention".
His lawyers have been instructed to lodge a complaint against the German weekly Der Spiegel, where the statements were published.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying 375,000 dollars to cover up the incident, according to a report in Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already amassed 142 million followers just hours after the news was released, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false", says five-time winner of the Golden Ball, looking at the camera.
They only want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but that is so.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," he added, smiling.
Ronaldo &apos; s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the allegations in what they called &quot; an unacceptable report on privacy suspicions &quot;, Reuters reported.
Christian Schertz, the player &apos; s lawyer, said the player would seek compensation for &quot; moral damages in an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years. &quot;
According to reports, the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to Ronaldo &apos; s room, where Ronaldo, according to the documents, allegedly raped Mayorga anally, as recorded in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo had knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was &quot; 99 per cent &quot; a &quot; good boy &quot; and that he had disappointed him &quot; one per cent &quot;.
In the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he and Irina had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photographs were taken of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "humiliated in public".
The woman, aged 34, claims to be trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged attack took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a big name in Italian football, on a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: the United Kingdom would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if we lost our position as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.
He said it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily halted.
Mr Clark said we needed an agreement.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays at customs in the event of a Brexit without a deal could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 per cent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production problems in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the general manager of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed concerns about the impact of a no-deal Brexit, in particular in relation to cross-border trade; including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of the car manufacturers relate to the problems that could arise in the event of a no-deal Brexit in the assembly lines.
Toyota &apos; s production line is based on the &quot; just in time &quot; method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border, according to the sector, which could lead to delays and stock-outs.
Toyota said it would be impossible to house the equivalent of more than a day &apos; s inventory in its Derbyshire plant and production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May &apos; s Chequers plan, which sets out future relations with the EU, was &quot; calibrated precisely to avoid those controls at the border &quot;.
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will not only see us through this moment but will allow us to take advantage of the opportunity.
Toyota &apos; s evidence, among others, is that we need to be able to continue with what, until now, has been a very successful supply chain.
Toyota had not been able to say how long the stoppage would last, but warned that, in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, ultimately, the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union representative at the plant, said his members were increasingly concerned: &quot; According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they are never recovered. &quot;
A government spokesman said: &quot; We have put in place a clear and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU. &quot;
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed another week, the White House said Sunday, as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continued.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Trump campaign ties to Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump would fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus compromise the independence of Mueller, has fueled the Washington gossip mill for months.
In early May, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone he carried himself in an attempt to remove the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, where the news was that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he &apos; d prefer not to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
Trump on Friday asked the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh &apos; s allegations for a week, which would delay a full Senate vote.
Trump &apos; s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed until everything with the Supreme Court settles down."
We will decide on the spot and I will inform the press as I usually do.
Some journalists would dispute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the lack of press availability was not due to a dislike of TV reporters who act grandiloquently, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they fanfaronade."
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President has more question-and-answer sessions than any other President before him, he said, adding, &quot; We have compared those numbers &quot;.
Press briefings will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly to the President of the United States, I think that is much better than asking me."
We have tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you could talk to the President of the United States.
Trump usually responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press briefings with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are very rare.
Indeed, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why he was so popular, where he made an uncharacteristically relaxed and, at times, bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish Government writes to NHS Scotland staff about their fears over Brexit
The Scottish Government Health Secretary has written to the EU Health and Social Care Workforce working group to express the gratitude of the country and its desire for them to continue to work with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of applications for citizenship for EU nationals working in non-central government services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: &quot; During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit continued, with a view to taking decisions this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom Government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know that all this must be very confusing for you.
And that is why I would like to repeat now how much I value the contribution of each and every member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
The experience and skills of professionals from across Europe and other countries are a valuable contribution to the work of the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without doubt, your home and we would love to continue to have you with us."
Christian Abercrombie is being operated on urgently after suffering a head wound
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player, was treated for a head injury in an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
He came over and collapsed there," Reed said.
Both the coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touchline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A member of the Tennessee State Hospital staff told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details yet on the type of injury or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State was trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding 18 tackles for the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to house the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The neutralisation of Corbyn &apos; s success in attracting younger voters will be offset by the neutralisation of the success of the Corbyn offensive
The increase in the land transaction tax will be applied to those individuals who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year, which will be used to help the homeless
The additional money raised from the increase in stamp duty on foreign buyers of UK property would be used to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is having in winning over younger voters by promising more affordable housing and to target those with higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp duty on land transactions will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to encourage the government &apos; s policy to combat begging on the streets.
The levy, which is an additional charge on the current stamp duty, also includes the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the &quot; buy-to-let &quot; system, which could reach up to 3 per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year from this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new build properties in London are bought by people who do not reside in the UK, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country &apos; s most affluent areas (especially the capital) have become &quot; ghost cities &quot; due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
She accused the big builders of keeping property prices artificially high by buying land in bulk without any intention of using it and urged Mrs May to abolish the &quot; shameful &quot; charges on affordable homes to solve the &quot; shameful &quot; problem of housing in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Ms May said: &quot; Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
That means dealing with the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people to achieve, and the humiliation of having to sleep on the streets is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland manager said his "primary objective" was to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited by the prospect of reviving the north-east club, which currently occupies third place in the League One (third tier of English football), three points behind the top team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only managed to get a B cap, he told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child and that has always made me want to go back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I can successfully manage a club.
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he did not feel any fear when he went to such established names in a big club after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club clearly correspond to those of the Premier League, as he said.
It is not easy to achieve, but I would only consider that I had achieved my objective here if I could return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a spell as Dumbarton assistant and a 15-month spell in the Hearts technical department.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and helped St. Mirren go from being on the brink of relegation to winning the league the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He said: &quot; I think it was a genuine crossroads when I took over at Alloa.
I always thought that management was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It sounds strange, because it was good, I could make a living out of it and I had some great moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work, but I feel good in the direction.
I always wanted to train and now I have managed to do so, it is the time of my adult life when I have felt better, without a doubt."

The heatwave of summer has boosted profits for struggling British pubs, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant profits fell by 4.8 per cent, according to the figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup has meant that July has followed the pattern of June, when pubs increased their turnover by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants have fallen even further.
The 1.8 per cent fall in restaurant trade in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, against the majority of restaurants, where profits fell.
Pubs that mainly serve food also suffered, although not to the same extent as restaurant operators.
It seems that people only want to go out to drink.
In managed pubs and bars, sales of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, a hospitality and leisure analyst at RSM, said: &quot; These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in terms of sales in the home-based activities market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still fighting, although the 4.8 per cent fall in sales compared with last year is going to be particularly painful given the continuing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food industry and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, data is collected and analysed for 47 operational groups, with combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the market reference point.
One in five children have secret accounts on social networks, behind their parents' backs
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret accounts on social media sites, according to a survey
The survey, conducted among 20,000 secondary school students, revealed an increase in Instagram fake news pages
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit material will be published
20 per cent of the students said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) create secret social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears that sexually explicit material will be published.
One-fifth of the students said they had a "main" account that they showed their parents, while having other private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter &apos; s secret site was horrified to see a teenage boy encouraging others to &quot; rape me &quot;.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters & Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: &quot; It is alarming that so many young people feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them. &quot;
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland &apos; s most decorated athlete on both the track and the field and Ian Beattie, the president of Scottish Athletics, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want sport to benefit from its great international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish, UK and global athletics community, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from her involvement in its leadership.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help to develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics between the four gold medals he won, suffered a transient ischaemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: &quot; One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It was hard, but I recovered completely, I had to learn to walk again and I am now doing agility exercises.
Thank you for your messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the "milking machine" where mothers are compared to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A baby food company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares mothers who breastfeed with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is purportedly the "world &apos; s first silent breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music that shows mothers counting the freedom that the new breast pump brings them.
Four real women dance in a hay barn, with cows, with signs such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues to sing: "Feed them, feed them, I am feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I am feeding my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company &apos; s Facebook page, has caused a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it focuses on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
As with us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, except that they take their babies away from them shortly after birth, &quot; wrote one person.
The Elvie breast pump is discreetly incorporated into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: &quot; Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to announce a breast pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a ridiculous announcement."
However, other people defended the announcement, including a woman who admitted that the song was &quot; disturbing &quot;.
I think that is a great idea.
If she were still suckling, I would have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but I am not going to dwell on it.
It is a great product”, said a woman.
Another person commented: &quot;It is a funny announcement directed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor criticizes the dairy sector.”
The final video shows the women dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the brassieres.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who express milk with a pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached to the nursing bra, which allows its users to move, hold their babies and even go out with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, a Mother ECD, told us: &quot; The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while at the same time demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time Elvie has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied alien children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied migrant children in detention has increased significantly, despite the fact that monthly apprehensions at the border have remained at historically high levels. In part, this is due to the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, which are making it more difficult to sponsor these children.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, testified before Congress that ICE had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Around 80 per cent of sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we are still pursuing these individuals,” said Albence.
In their haste to process juveniles more quickly, staff have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from arrest, rather than 60 days, as the previous norm, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to workers at reception centres and reports from the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer they are held in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
As the defenders point out, these concerns are even more acute in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs of distress in these children will be overlooked.
Moreover, the transfer to the camp without having given them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma, which many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country &apos; s war has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the vice-prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the matter would be dealt with accordingly.
They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally, he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to &quot; fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorists and any foreign illegal presence &quot;.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advising to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-ravaged country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "planting irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay away.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns.
They were &quot; politicizing &quot; what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a de-escalation zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault on the Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem made clear that the agreement had &quot; clear deadlines &quot; and expressed the hope that the military action would focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters, who would be &quot; eradicated &quot;.
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations special envoy, is expected to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-conflict constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee, arguing that the panel &apos; s work should be limited to &quot; reviewing the articles of the current constitution &quot; and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, a resignation or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would be without doubt &quot; the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen! &quot;
There are no signs of fatigue among the spectators at the moment.
Since 2014, the CNN and MSNBC ratings during the peak audience hour have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million, respectively.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in the prime-time audience share, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has surpassed cable news channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for its prime-time news programs.
Neal Baer, the show &apos; s executive producer, tells us, &quot; It &apos; s an odd attraction that we still haven &apos; t figured out. &quot; The ABC drama &quot; Designated Survivor &quot; is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a terrorist attack destroys the Capitol.
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell has another theory.
He recalled a trip in a taxi he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
Because it makes me laugh, was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos is always rife in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of families being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the privileged few can afford.
However, the information overloads you when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear," the $15,000 python skin jacket of Paul Manafort ("a garment of overweening pride," in the words of The Washington Post), and the salacious descriptions of Stormy Daniels of the anatomy of Trump.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Mario in the same way again.
Offering something new every night is in part what makes everything seem like a reality show, says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of "Pawn Stars" and creator of "Pawn Stars," when he talks about the show's alternating Trump and daily storylines (whether it's going up against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can &apos; t afford to miss an episode if you don &apos; t want to be left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside the house watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
I remember when we were doing all those crazy programmes and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilisation.
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows into the most tightly contested midterm elections in the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that money is flowing into the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the redistricting of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election to the same seat.
This residential district in Pittsburg, whose structure was recently redesigned, is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another Republican challenger, Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, a district that overlaps significantly with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding war between the major party financial arms, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
The name of Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed off
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight Washington objection.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the partners of the Organization Trump evicted the Organization &apos; s management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in U.S. assistance in 2017 for, among other things, combating drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and restrictions on certain visa categories, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials in the administration made clear that their intention was that the conference should go ahead, which put an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October and seen by diplomats as a sign of the importance the administration has placed on the meeting.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or reprisals from Washington.
A White House spokesman rejected comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.
History study
The next step could be the special counsel Robert Mueller &apos; s report on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which is already supported by substantial public evidence.
Mueller is also investigating the possibility that the Trump campaign was working in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable by that chamber, just as he is preparing to run for a second term and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and I am not suggesting that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that his European equivalents will fall.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the length of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have stood up to him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The history of the world revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans now face several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good place since this paper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his inability to serve.
Rosenstein says that The Times &apos; explanation is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
In addition to all this, will we vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will be facing a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador &apos; s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home on Thursday against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until Rangers drew 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
We got a good point out of it, because Villarreal is a good team,
We started the game believing we could get something and we came away with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and we were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already got a good result in the previous game. But with the support of the crowd, I am sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be all right.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying themselves a lot and we are having a good training session.
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind us and achieve success.”
The fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their families.
Around half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they talked to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the steps to have that conversation, says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options may be a determining factor in the cost.
Include in the conversion of his financial advisor, as he may also be able to help him find a way to pay for these expenses.
His options for long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help him cover his costs or to insure himself with his own savings, provided he has the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Ensure that a medical power of attorney is obtained to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals are fulfilling your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
It can also prepare a notarial power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don &apos; t forget the little things: imagine your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions on drugs and allergies?

Several shots are fired at a man with a rifle in Ilfracombe
Several shots were fired at a man with a rifle as he was walking home after leaving the house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 (BST), as a "random act".
The victim did not see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications blocked, the assistance staff have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, a northern area of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is a lower-level administrative region, had a population estimated at 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit Donggala West in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of great seismic activity, and is frequently subject to earthquakes.
Following, we summarize some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake in western Aceh Province, North Sumatra, on 26 December 2004 triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of deaths were reported on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake devastated southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coast, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 killer earthquake and tsunami.
This time, however, it did not cause a tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) was hit by a series of large earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin &apos; s eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin and a vice-presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin has been placed in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 cash bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he was declared "absolutely innocent" when asked to make a statement, reported the channel.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could result in up to one year in prison and a $25,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a possible sentence of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, she was accused of assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son &apos; s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have collapsed and it is expected that the death toll will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just to the side of the Sulawesi centre, which is located to the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bike path attack in Manhattan's West Side Highway last October, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify a death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily harm, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to the prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as specified in the notice of intention.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been over a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal death penalty was carried out in New York in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to conduct the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be hoisted in his hospital room, said police.
He was found not guilty of 22 charges.
One of Mr. Saipov &apos; s federal public defenders, David Patton, said that they were &quot; obviously disappointed &quot; with the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma for all those involved in these events.
Saipov &apos; s defence team had previously requested that the prosecutors not seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to &quot; mobilise the people &apos; s army &quot; today during a Tory conference protest.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May &apos; s MPs suggested he should handle the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Theresa May in trying to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more by a group of Tories in favour of remaining who have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers agreement on the table in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force Euro-sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and "chaos".
The Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Mr Bone said he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been given a post with responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now, she said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: &quot; We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
He dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
The Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: &quot; I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote for it and it is not popular within our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: &quot; Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises. &quot;
Farage told the packed room that if politicians were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they would have to feel the heat.
Now it is a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
We are going to mobilise the people &apos; s army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, those in favour of the stay had taken to the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists were waving placards from Tories Against Brexit after the group &apos; s launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Tories for their security problems with the party during the opening of the conference.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the IT systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the harmonized border, for the free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing to be called a good Brexit”, he added.
Warren is considering all options for running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will &quot; consider all options &quot; for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump &apos; s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the sixth of its kind since Trump took office, using the municipal format.
A staff member asked whether he intended to stand for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that included having a woman at the top.
An arrest in the shooting death of LSU football player Tyrone Sims
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interview, Simpson admitted being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-metre-tall player from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since the moment Bottas beat Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes team orders would play a key role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost put Hamilton out of the picture by defending his position in the first two races and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Sebastian Vettel was first into the pits and let Lewis Hamilton run in the back of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out a lap later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after a wheel-to-wheel battle that left the Ferrari driver having to give up the inside line at risk of being passed again later on, in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 on that day, started from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first race.
He led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and pass Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
Finally, he came into the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to recover fourth place from Räikkönen.
It has been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman in letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job to get the perfect pairing,” said Hamilton.
That was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the Christine Blasey Ford letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the nominee for the Supreme Court.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Mr. Ford &apos; s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were &quot; bad, repugnant and false people &quot; in the Senate.
The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening in the Senate right now is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, repugnant and false,
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say "But I didn't do it."
I did not do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember your answer - did you filter the document?
Oh, no.
I did not leak it.
Well, give me a minute.
Have we filtered...? No, we have not filtered”, he added while imitating the Senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the leak was reported in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
I did not hide Dr. Ford &apos; s allegations, I did not leak her story, &quot; said Feinstein to the committee, as reported by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and, therefore, I did.
But his refusal did not seem to sit well with the President, who during the Saturday night rally said the following: "I am telling you, that was a really bad body language."
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.”
Continuing his defence of the nominee of the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don &apos; t care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get power and control, &quot; said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered from their Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match on Saturday by 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants took an early two-goal lead thanks to the goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local score before Dwyer restored the Giants &apos; lead.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third defeat in the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams, with the Giants having won the previous three.
Dwyer &apos; s first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) on an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier &apos; s second goal four minutes later.
In a very lively opening period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt tied the game for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game in the second half and secure victory with the fifth goal of their team as they approached the final whistle.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
A traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane in the earthquake
A traffic controller from Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after dying while ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to rock the area, and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, where the tower was being severely shaken.
He remained firm to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
He jumped from the control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told ABC News that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian ABC News channel.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
Our hearts break when we hear this, she added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
The number of victims is expected to rise, as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people have not been contacted, he said.
Tsunami waves up to six metres high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Assistance and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies."
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as many survivors as possible, but we don't know what they will find there."
That is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.
Indonesia &apos; s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country &apos; s military: &quot; I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in the first half of this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that one person is missing after the Micronesia air accident
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one man is missing, after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had escaped safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening, it had been unable to account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to assist in rescuing the other passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk International Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still not clear.
The airline and the United States Navy said the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the aircraft had overrun the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane came in very low.
That is extremely good, said Jaynes.
Jaynes stated that he and other passengers had managed to move forward through water that was up to their waists to the emergency exits of the aircraft which was beginning to sink.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said that sailors working on a nearby pier also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the PNG Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in PNG over the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A witness describes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up its arguments in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014 on Saturday.
The expert from the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the cell phone records to link Quinton Tellis &apos; s movements to the night Jessica Chambers died.
Rowlett said he received data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contradicting earlier statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Chambers &apos; mobile phone had been with Sanford &apos; s phone during the time Chambers said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford &apos; s truck that night, Sanford said he was &quot; lying because my truck was in Nashville. &quot;
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only met a week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers &apos; s death, Tellis deleted Chambers &apos; s messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
Hale said, &quot; She wiped her life away. &quot;
The defence is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be completed by the jury that day.
The High Breed: &quot; What is Conscious Hip Hop? &quot;
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that hip-hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Acts such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues couple for text message &quot; racist &quot;
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discrimination after receiving an incorrect text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the complaint with a case of &quot; extortion &quot;.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed her shock when she discovered that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that he was expecting a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received his daily wage and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving $350 per day for the six-month position for which she had been hired, but without a contract.
I want to show them that things don &apos; t happen that way, &quot; he told The Post on Friday, and added, &quot; I know this is a case of discrimination. &quot;
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice &apos; s employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after having offended her.
My wife had sent him something he did not want to say.
She is not racist.
We are not racists, said Joel Plasco to the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone who had been rude to you, even if it was an accident?
To your newborn baby?
Come on!”
Comparing the demand as "extortion", Plasco said that his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to go after someone like that?
That is not a very decent thing”, added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public opinion court has already condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behaviour and logic.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond &apos; s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: &quot; It was difficult to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before publication.
It is very funny to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC page before being inspired by a teddy bear to write a children &apos; s book, had hoped that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was &quot; bittersweet &quot; after his death last year.
She described Paddington as &quot; a very important member of our family &quot; and said that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very calm man who did not like to boast.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if he had a son who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, though it was not really your achievement.
I think he saw Paddington as a success in that way.
Although it was his creation and product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
As soon as the plane landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
She said: &quot; He called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he did not expect to succeed. &quot;
I then received a call from Nad to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said: "Tashi, I love you very much."
I will be with you.
I will be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were wearing out slowly and leaving his system.
She had died too soon and everything was going out.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not scream, cry or shout because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stick to my guns.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the aircraft with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was taking place.
He said, &quot; Nobody knew that. &quot;
I bowed my head and tears were constantly falling.
It is hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much I loved him.
Women in mourning cards to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
She said: &quot; I do not want any father to feel what I feel every day.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
He was known to everyone by his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up any place.
However, he left his job before he died, as he was &quot; in a really dark place &quot;.
In 2014, Tyler &apos; s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: &quot; I am constantly worried about the consequences &quot;.
Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people to go to and people to talk to, even if they are friends."
Don &apos; t sit in silence, you have to talk about it.
Ms. Humphreys, who had been a friend of Davies for many years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been together for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
He said he was not depressed or anything like that.
Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to overcome it: &quot; It leaves a big hole in the family.
It has left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh &apos; s future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
I thought if we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited time, limited scope investigation), maybe we could bring a little unity to the committee, and I was concerned that the committee was going to go off the rails in the middle of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican backers not want the FBI investigation to proceed?
His refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
Only five weeks remain until the midterm elections, on 6 November. If, as expected, the Republicans have a bad showing, their efforts to elect the man they want for the Supreme Court will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President &apos; s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break a tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The figures for North Korean deserters "fall" in line with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Reunification of the South, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
He said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by traffickers, had been the key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on this.
Most of the deserters from the north eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of May, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks on the nuclear negotiations.
This followed the historic Singapore Summit in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, where they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea &apos; s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on U.S. sanctions.
Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally, he said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee to the Supreme Court, was a "histrionic" and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Pelosi said she could not stop thinking that if a woman had acted in that way, she would have been called a hysteric.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost shouting and choking as he spoke of his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the allegations against him &quot; grotesque and clearly coordinated smears &quot; organized by some angry liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her view, Kavanaugh &apos; s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he has pursued the Clintons and the Democrats.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and Democrats took control of the House.
She said: &quot; I will say only one thing: if she is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, she will not be fit to be on the Supreme Court, and she will not be fit to be on the court on which she now sits. &quot;
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh &apos; s possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
This is not the time for a hysterical person and an impartial judge to go to court and expect us to think everything is fine,” Pelosi said.
And women have to take it up.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and she cannot let it go without crying.
We cry when we are angry, she said to me 45 years later.
I do not think that is so unusual, is it?
She continued: &quot; I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager in some company and she told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to: &quot; Perhaps you think I am crying because I am sad.&quot;
No, I am not angry.
And then he continued with what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger because, in fact, they are not understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once when I found myself crying with an unexpressed rage. A serious older woman, a manager I had always been slightly afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a staircase.
He said, &quot; Never let them see you cry. &quot;
They have no idea that you are angry.
They think you are sad and they will be happy because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea that she could run for president herself.
It was not a well-considered decision, he said to me 30 years later, with a laugh.
There were already seven candidates in the race and what they did not need was another candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”.
As the campaign was already well under way, it was decided that it would not enter the race again unless it had raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
Is that a discount?”, he asked.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on capturing voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown, said Schroeder, recalling the reaction of the press.
You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
Did he "cry"?
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although there is still much to be fought out, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning in early 2018 by imposing tariffs on the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs that will affect $200 billion (£150 billion) in goods, which will impose a 50 per cent tariff on half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently imposing tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to retaliate in kind against US attacks, and it is unlikely that the world &apos; s second largest economy will back down soon.
To back down would mean to give in to the demands, but to publicly submit to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the trade war with the United States could help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a sudden economic collapse in either country is actually much more dangerous than the audience has recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for New American Security focused on Asia.
Syria ready to receive refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country &apos; s conditions were improving.
The situation on the ground is today more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All the conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their means of livelihood.
The UN estimated that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians had fled the country.
There are still 6 million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had supported the insurgency.
Ryder Cup comes to Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last victory in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe reclaimed the Ryder Cup when Thomas Bjorn &apos; s Danish team won 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his ball into the water on the par-3 16th hole, admitting defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players to have ever achieved a 5-0-0 score since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Denmark &apos; s Thorbjorn Olesen, 5 and 4.
World number one Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio García became the European player with the most Ryder Cup wins of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
I do not usually cry, but I cannot stop today.
It has been a very hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for having chosen me and believing in me.
I am very happy to have been able to get the cup back.
It was a team effort and I am very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team &apos; s victory.
Now it is the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who beat the legendary American Tiger Woods by two and one in a singles match on Sunday.
I feel an incredible pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, because I have grown up watching this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
That is an odd statistic for one of the all-time greats, who has won 14 major championships, trailing only Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we spoil it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it is our turn to bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.”
