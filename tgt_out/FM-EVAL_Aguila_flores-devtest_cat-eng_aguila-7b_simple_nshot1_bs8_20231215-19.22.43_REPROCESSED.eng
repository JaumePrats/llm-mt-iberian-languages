The pH of a substance is the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. You can make a pH indicator by using a sample of col llombarda.
The colour of the col llombarda changes according to the acidity or alkalinity of the substance.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H+) in the sample.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which the electrons have been removed (in the sense that hydrogen consists of a proton and an electron).

Their size is between a cat and a dog, and they are called "mammals".
The smallest of the felids, the European wildcat, is a specialist predator of small vertebrates, including small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.
The secret of his success is the concept of a niche, a special type of competition that each cat has and that prevents him from competing with the other cats.
The lions are the most social of all the felids and live in large groups called bands.
The packs are usually composed of a dominant male and a harem of females and their offspring.
The sisters and daughters of the same mother are called "sisters-in-law" and "sisters-in-law".
Leopard bands behave like wolf packs, which are animals with a similar behaviour to that of the lion (although not as similar as that of other large felids) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (even though not very well), swim, jump great distances and push with 5 times the strength of a human strongman.

The roar of the tiger is like the roar of the lion, but is louder and more like the roar of a bear.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. If they can, they will hunt mice, snakes, birds and small birds.
The scientists believe that the ocelot will follow and find the animals that are eating (prey) with their sense of smell, scenting the ground for the scent of their prey.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and can move very quietly. They hunt their prey by ambushing them, and then they afford themselves to stalk their prey.
When a small population of organisms (a small population of animals) crosses a barrier and becomes isolated from the rest of the population, it is often found in a different environment from the one it had before.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need to have different characteristics or adaptations from those it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The population of the town has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations that they had before.
The new population is beginning to resemble the old population.
The two species were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
Species are formed when a population of organisms is isolated from other populations.

The most common formats (e.g. APS) are very similar to this relationship, or very close to it.

One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few cases of children who were not socialized by adults while they were growing up, due to neglect, misfortune or malicious intent.
These children are called "wild" or "feral". Some children have been isolated by people (generally their parents); in some cases this abandonment was due to the severe intellectual or physical disability of the child by the parents.
The children of the wild can have suffered abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Otherwise, the only animals that have been bred specifically for racing are the horses.
The infant wild child, when raised only by animals, exhibits (always within the limits of physical force) almost the same behaviors as the animal that raises him, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
The bastida is a new way of teaching that is based on the idea that students are more likely to learn if they are working on a project that is relevant to their lives.
The bastida theory is not a method of learning, but a tool that provides support to individuals who are engaged in a new learning experience, such as learning to use a new computer program or undertaking a new project.
The bastides can be virtual or real: a bastida is a virtual or real construction device.
Virtual bastides are computer-generated structures that can be used to show and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to solve on his own.

The gene pool is the pool of genes that are passed on from generation to generation.
It is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its nutritional needs from the plants available.
The death of a child is a terrible thing to see.
The easiest plant resources would have been the proteins that are found in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us, the humans.
The animals that eat food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are digested easily, but they contain a great amount of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
It is not surprising that our ancestors solved their protein problem like today's chimpanzees do in the savanna.
Near-sleep is the process of waking up during the normal period of sleep and then falling back to sleep again at a later time.
It's easy to do by using a loud clock that makes you awake but doesn't wake you completely.
If you're of those who rewind their watches while sleeping, try to put it on the other end of the room, so you have to turn it on to wake up.
Other options based on the biological rhythms include drinking many fluids (especially water or tea) before going to bed, so that one is obliged to urinate while awake.

The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fags, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulfur.
The mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the amount of genetic material affected, and if the cells affected are cells of the germinal line.
Only mutations in the germline cells of the lineage can be passed on to the offspring, but mutations at any other site can cause cell death or cancer.

The study of traffic flow is the study of the movement of individuals and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
It is difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict the driver's behaviour with 100% certainty.
The speed of traffic is a function of the number of vehicles in the road, and the number of vehicles in the road is a function of the speed of traffic.
To represent the flow of traffic better, the three main characteristics are: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operations of highway construction projects.
