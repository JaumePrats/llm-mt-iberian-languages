The lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called prides.
The manades are formed by a group of adult males related to each other and to 30 females and calves.

The roar of the tiger is not the roar of the lion, which is the roar of a lion without a roar, without a roar, without a roar.
The ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they hunt mice, snakes, scorpions and lizards. All the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than those hunted by other cats.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find the animals that they hunt by smell, leaving tracks that they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark, and they can also see very well at night. They can also kill their prey very silently.
When a small group of shepherds (a small population) separates from the main group (for example, by founding a forest or a river, or by emigrating to a new island and not returning) they will often find themselves in a different environment from the one they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will require different characteristics or adaptations different from those needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population has not canvassed people or mice, they should follow the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by, as the new population adapts itself to its new environment, it begins to seem more and more like the other population.
Finally, after thousands of years and millions of years, the two populations are so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
I have named this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and is a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe and take carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. they breathe out).
Plants manufacture their food from the soil by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and we use plants for our clothes and other things. The majority of the people in Catalonia are vegetarians. Without plants, the majority of animals could not survive.

If you have seen the film National Treasure, you may have imagined that at the end of the Declaration of Independence there is a map of the treasure.
Yes, it is not certain. Although there is a written document about the treasure, it is not a map of the treasure.
The text is found at the bottom of the document, after the approval.
It is certain that no one knows for certain that the author will write, since the first in the series of the author's works, the "Pergamino de la lengua catalana" (29¾ polzades per 24½ polzades), is rolled up for storage.
Thus, it seems that the notation is going to be simply a label.
The disembarkations of the day D and the battles that will follow will free the north of France, but the south is still not free.

In only two weeks, the United States and the French forces have liberated the south of France and advanced towards Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civitas, which means "civil", and relates to the Latin word civitas, which means "civil", and to the Latin word ciutat, which means "city" or "civitas", and to the Latin word ciutat, which means "city" or "civitas", and to some way of defining the society.
The cities precede the nations. A civilised culture implies the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural practice and an equitable diffusion.
The disappearance of minority cultures without leaving any historical traces and without being recognized as civilizing is a fact that is not recognized.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a central government which was weak and ineffective, and the Congress was its only component. The Articles of Confederation were the only component of the central government.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and, as a result, there was no one to execute them or to carry out judicial proceedings, and the authorities of the state, which were often few, had to carry out all the acts of the cooperative.
The Catalan Government did not have the authority to invalidate the tax laws and the tax regulations between the states.
The Articles require the unanimous approval of all the States before they can be examined and the States will take such a long time to examine the central government that their representatives often absent themselves.

In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three principal buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings in the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they will find when they arrive.
In 1976, the Machu Picchu had been restored to 30% of its original state and the restoration work continues today.
For example, the standard format of the frame is 35 mm, which was the standard size of the film used in the analog era.
The production of this day, however, is still more important: the relationship between the two formats of the sensors of the digital cameras has been broken.
The 35 mm format creates, in fact, a confusion of a few millimetres, which is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
It is true that the relation of aspect of this format (dividing it into twelve to obtain a relation of names with the simplest number) is, therefore, 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to this aspect.
The rule of thirds, which has been used in the past and ridiculed, is a pattern that creates dynamism and order in an image.
The most efficient place for the subject is the intersection between the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example).
During this period, l'histoire européenne va poser la question de l'Église catholique, qui a été riche et puissante.
During more than a millennium, la religion chrétienne a uni les états européens, malgré les différences de langue et de coutumes.
His power is omnipresent, affecting everyone, from kings to plebeians.
One of the principal principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's financial resources should exist precisely for this purpose.
The principal authority of the Church in Rome has been there for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and wealth will mean that many people will be asking if this dogma has been complied with.
After the beginning of the hostilities, Brittany began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy will prove to be effective, as the vital ministries of military and civilian personnel will be affected, even though the blockade violated international laws generally accepted by various international agreements in the last two centuries.
The Bretanya will undermine the international watercourses in order to avoid that any vessel may enter the entire ocean, posing a threat to all neutral vessels.
With a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its submarine warfare without restrictions.
During the years 1920, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and neutrality.

The Ancient Xina had a unique way of showing different historical periods: each dynasty was a different family.
There were also unstable periods in the dynasties, as in the case of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods there will be fierce wars between many nobles who will fight for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods of the ancient China, thousands of people died fighting for the throne in the Forbidden City in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a governing class.
Immediately after the Revolution, occupations will be carried out by all those who wish to do so, and those who are more ambitious and successful will be able to obtain them.
This also applies to the military, because in the place of basing the military institutions on classes, they will be based on the relevance.
The French Revolution will also inspire many other workers in other oppressed countries to start their revolutions.
Mahoma is deeply interested in the spiritual aspects of life. He used to frequent a cave that would be known as "Hira" in the Mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a clear image of the spiritual inclinations of Mohammed.
At the top of the mountain of the north of Mecca, the cave is completely filled with the rest of the world.
In fact, and in all cases, it is not easy to find them. The hunting is absolute in the cave.
There is no need to go to the top of a montaña to see the dawn. There are many mountains and abundant mountains that can be seen from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still exists.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, and it is one of the many great pyramids built to honour the Pharaoh who died.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh, or "Necropolis of Gizeh", is located in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead. Among the pyramids, the Great Pyramid is the largest, and among the tombs, there are small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is to be built in honour of the Pharaoh Kheops, and many other pyramids, tombs and minor temples are to be erected in honour of the Pharaoh's relatives and members of his family.

In a certain point, un membre de la foule montre le chapeau d'un gardien assassiné à Versailles devant la Reine horrifiée.
The war expenses of the imperialism of North America during the conquest of the Philippines are borne by the Filipino people themselves.
It will be necessary to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States, so that we can contribute to the expenses and interest of the good bills issued in the name of the Filipino government through the banks of Wall Street.
According to the Filipino workers, the exploitation of the Filipino people for a long time will be the basic basis of the imperialism of the United States.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context in which the Order was created.
The period in which the events will take place is commonly known as the Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 11th to the 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Plena Edat Mitjana was preceded by the Alta Edat Mitjana and followed by the Baixa Edat Mitjana, which ended in the year 1500.
Determinism is a term that is used in practice to refer to a wide range of ideas, from the technological imperative to the technological imperative. The human being is guided by a hidden logic that is associated with scientific laws and the manifestation of technology in the world.
The majority of interpretations of determinism technological share two general ideas: that the technological development follows a path in which the influence of cultural or political factors is much less than in other areas, and that technology, at the same time, has "side effects" for societies, which are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the costs of the motor vehicles are necessary for the development of the railway network.
The network of toll roads is not viable economically, so we are developing other methods of production to reduce the cost of having a toll road.
The possession of large amounts of tolls also leads to a greater incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of nine new medical assistance techniques for repairing damaged vehicles.
Romanticism will have an important deterministic cultural component, as expressed by Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romanticism context, geography gave shape to the people, and with the passing of time, customs and cultures related to that geography appeared that were better than those imposed arbitrarily, since they were found in harmony with the place and with society.
Paris and Istanbul are well known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, and Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of the feudal Europe.
His fame as a centre of luxury will begin in the 4th century BC and will last until approximately the 11th century AD.
The Catalan status will diminish during the 12th century, especially because the Croats have returned to the city as a place of pilgrimage and have brought more valuable goods than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At this moment, le titre de capital de la mode va passer de Constantinople à Paris.
The Gothic style will achieve the maximum popularity during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was influenced by the Byzantine culture.
The delay in the canals of communication is the cause of the late arrival of the styles. They can arrive 25 to 30 years later.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe will begin to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the period is that, as a result of the Crusades, the people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is that which is aimed at producing food only to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
The subsistence agriculture is a simple, organic system, which uses local native species and combines them with other techniques relatively simple to maximize the yield.
Historically, the majority of the peasants are dedicated to subsistence agriculture, and this is also the case in many countries in the process of development.
The subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas in order to feel less abandoned by the standards of society and to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often distinguish themselves from other subcultures by using distinctive styles, customs and argot.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to a few unfortunate cases of children who will not be socialized by adults because of negligence, misfortune or abuse.
The children are called "salvajes" or "ferals". Some of them have been taken in by persons (generally their peers); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the difficulty of the parents to cope with the child's intellectual or physical disability.
Children who have been maltreated can suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or nightmares before they are abandoned or flee.
Other animals have been created by other animals; some of them have lived in a state of salvation throughout all the days.
The infant savant, who is born only to animals and never to humans, presents behaviors (within certain physical limits) similar to those of the animal he is rearing, as well as indifference towards humans.
Even though the learning based on projects would make the learning easier and more interesting, the bastida is one step further.
The theory of the bastida is not a method of learning, but an aid that provides the individual with the opportunity to learn a new experience of formation, as in the case of learning to use a new information technology or starting a new project.
Bastides can be virtual or real: in another way, a professor is a bastide, but also a small clip of Microsoft Office.
Virtual bastides are internalized in the programming and are thought of to question, show and explain procedures that can be very complicated because the student is not used to them.
Infants are given in foster care for different reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse, passing through extortion.
The child will not have to grow up in an environment that is not fed, educated or cared for, but only those who do.
I believe that the system of family reunification is a form of security for these children.
Our system of foster care must provide safe, loving care, a stable education and reliable health care.
It is supposed that the reception confers all the necessities that are not covered in the house where the person is going to take up residence originally.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet entail additional dimensions in terms of the focus on uses and gratifications.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The personal involvement and "relations in progress" will also be identified as motivating aspects for Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigate the reaction of the public to web sites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it was affirmed that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by interpreting correctly his microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, indicated that not everyone is capable of understanding the speech because of brain damage, but that everyone is capable of assessing the sincerity of the speech.
It is suggested that these capacities of interpretation of human behaviour could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two genetic combinations: exposed and susceptible.
The mutation affects a new genetic variation, and the selection eliminates the combination of variations that express the patrimony of variation.
The segregation and recombination combine the variation within and between the two genetic pools in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate to satisfy its amino acid requirements with the diet of the human, because the available plant resources are not sufficient.
Moreover, the consequences of this situation are serious: a decrease in growth, malnutrition and finally death.
The easiest way to obtain proteins is to eat cooked vegetables, but these are difficult to digest for humans.
In the case of animal origin foods (ants, termites, ous), they are easily digested and they contain a great quantity of proteins which contain all the essential amino acids.
However, we will not be surprised if the Spanish government does not solve the problem of protein deficiency in the Sahara. After all, we have already been surprised by the fact that the Spanish government has not solved the problem of protein deficiency in the Sahara.
The interruption of the sound is the process of falling asleep and waking up at the end of the normal period of sleep (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do with a clock that wakes you up gently but not completely.
If you are one of those who wake up while the rellotge is being turned, try to put it on the other side of the room, so that you can turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythms include drinking a lot of liquids (especially water or tea), before going to bed, so that one has to get up to urinate.
The quantity of interior poverty that a person possesses is correlated in an opposite way to the quantity of tension in the body and the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive is the vital force. Each person has the potential to find peace and satisfaction.
We will arrive at illumination. The only thing that stands in our way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is also disseminated through the path of love of the Mahayana and many technical yogic techniques of India.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of the kundaliní yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With the Kundalini Yoga, the energy Kundalini is awakened (illuminated energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deities. By visualizing various deities, the channels of energy are activated, the karmic seeds are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was the enemy of the Second World War, and this will facilitate the collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. The armistice will bring about the arrival of systems, processes and cultures, and both countries will be enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the Catalans were enemies of the Spanish and the war was cold.
It will extend the forty years following the 1977 coup and will fight alongside, with delegations of ex-prisoners, in battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had been penetrated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the bridgehead.
The plans to create a new army in the night, which will be obsolete by the end of the night, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army will enter and create the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after having violated the Pact of Non-Aggression of Riga, the Warsaw Treaty and other international treaties, bilateral or multilateral, will be obsolete.
To use ships to transport merchandise and, with a difference, the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and merchandise across the oceans.
The traditional role of the Marines has been to ensure that your country maintains the capacity to protect its citizens and their property, while at the same time interfering with the capacity of your enemy to kill your citizens and their property.
One of the most recent examples is the campaign of the United States and the United Kingdom to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean during the Second World War. The Americans and British are trying to help Great Britain.
At present, la marine allemande, principalmente con submarinos, intenta aturar el tráfico.
If the Allies had failed, it is probable that Germany would have conquered Great Britain, as she has done with the rest of Europe.
It seems that the cabras se domesticaron por primera vez en el Zagros, en el Irán, hace unos 10.000 años.
The ancient cultures and tribes will begin to domesticate the wild boar, the bear, the deer and the rabbit easily by having a plentiful supply of food.
Domestic goats should be kept in areas where they can graze in pastures, or in other areas of pasture, and should be watched by shepherds who are children or adolescents. These methods of grazing are still used today.
The wagons will be built in England in the 16th century.
The only thing that the lives of convicts consist in is the punishment of the convicts with the whip, which is carried out in the wagons with horses, and the carrying of heavier loads and more difficult routes.
The sleepers will be introduced by force aircraft to maintain life at their location. However, aircraft will see that the lives would be more efficient if they had a cover of iron over.
This will become a routine practice, but the rails will wear out more on the trucks.
In the end, the rods of fusta will be replaced by rods of iron. The first complete rods of iron will be introduced in 1767.
The first transport company to be registered in Catalonia was founded in 1971. The first human beings began to walk upright about two million years ago, with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means upright man).
The Australian Aborigines, who normally walk on their hands, will not walk on their hands.
They have found bipedal fossils of austrolopithecines in the 4.2-3.9 million year old fossils of the australopithecines, and that the sahelanthropids could have walked on two legs up to 7 million years ago.
We can start living more respectfully with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become activists for reducing the environmental damage that may exist in the future.
This only works in the majority of cases. However, if we do not want a temporary solution, we will have to find the root of the problem and we will have to deactivate it.
It is evident that the world has suffered a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humanity, and that the problems have increased because of the excess of population and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After the adoption of the resolution by the Congress on July 4, 1789, he will send a letter to the printer, John Hancock and Charles Thompson, the Secretary of Congress, who are located a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies are printed, which are known as "Dunlap's volants".
The first public reading of the document will take place on July 8 at Independence Hall.
The letter is sent to George Washington on July 6, and it will be read by the five regiments in New York on July 9. A copy will arrive in London on August 10.
The 25 copies of Dunlap that are still in existence are copies of the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original manuscript has not been examined.
Many paleontologists believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and that they are still alive. In the morning, owls.
Many people do not see dinosaurs as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many species of birds that assemble in the same dinosaur.
They have a lot of pecs and urps, they put their feet on the back of the others and walk on their backs like a tyrannosaurus.
Practically all the presidents who are serving today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary names.
A binary number can only have two possible values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to the jargon of the computer.
The internal enverinament may not be immediately evident. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general and so it is not possible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of the implementation of the internal regulations could be the presence of a container for medicines or domestic chemical products toxic.
Instructions on the use of specific auxiliary aids for the identification of the product.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal way for this group of insects.
This term derives from the anti-parentalism of the xinxes, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Both the reduvids and the xinxes are rare, adapted to see in the nest or the host's habitat.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it with the most common neurological disease in young and adult people.
The EM is a neurological disease that affects the central nervous system, the medulla oblongata, the optic nerve and the nerves of the eye.
The research has concluded that women have twice as many chances of suffering multiple sclerosis as men.
A party can decide that it is not in its interests to create a new school, even if it is in the interests of its members or the interests of its supporters.
These countries could decide to adopt a similar policy for their swimmers.
In the adoption, the parents of the child will have to renounce their parental rights, so that another parent can adopt the child.
The main objective of science is to explain the functioning of the world through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides the vast majority of scientific research.
Yes, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a proof used to eliminate one or more hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers will focus on the texts of the classics and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.
They will accept all of Aristotelis' opinions on all the assumptions of science, including psychology.
In this way, the knowledge of the Greeks will diminish, and the Orient will be disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms that are observed in physiology and behavior are often dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and on their production, using biological mechanisms.
The periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in the majority of the cases, such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological oscillations are self-regulating and follow a period of inertia until the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase have developed a virus that can be used to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted to mark the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive phosphorus.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, whether the affected cells are germinal cells or somatic cells, and whether the mutation is in the germinal or somatic cell.
The mutations in germinal cells are the only ones that can be transmitted to the sons, and the mutations in any other cell can cause cellular or cancer death.
Nature tourism is based on the natural attractions of the area, with the aim of attracting people interested in visiting the natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wild life.
Examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks and studies of the ecosystem.
An example of this is to visit, photograph and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, the people of the rural areas leave their homes to go to work and return home at the end of the day. They leave their homes to go to work and return home at the end of the day.
In this dynamic vehicle, in some way, is connected with, and supports, a system of transport based on private tolls.
The science shows us today that this colossal economy of carbon has broken down one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has provided support for the evolution of man during the last two million years.
Tothom participates in the society and uses transport systems. Gairebé tothom is a complaint about the transport systems.
As a country with a developed water supply, you will often hear complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, why do they fall so often? Is it because the engineers are incompetent? Or is it because there is a fundamental lack of competence?
The Flux of Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that arise between them.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict the behavior of the driver with certainty.
The conductors behave in a fairly constant manner within a given range; the flow of traffic tends to be constant and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To represent better the flow of traffic, relations have been established between the three main characteristic features of the two cities: (1) cabal, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relations will help to plan, design and carry out the construction of railway lines.
Insects are the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them to escape from their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more efficiently.
Most of the insects have the advantage of being able to bend the will of the other insects by using their strength.
This provides a great variety of small places where the predators can be attacked.
Today, the insects that cannot fold their wings are the wasps and the ephemera.
The Spanish astronomer Aristarcus has said that the solar system is moving around the Sun.
There will be some people who think that the one who said it was right, but many people think that the Solar System is moving towards the Earth, including the Sun (and all the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because we don't feel that the Earth is moving.
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the largest. It transports 8 times more water than the second longest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the widest river of the Earth, sometimes it is more than a thousand miles wide.
20% of the water that comes from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazones is 6,387 km long and water comes from many small rivers.
The construction of pyramids with stone will continue until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, the measurement and the technical excellence of the construction of the pyramids of Gizeh will not be surpassed.
The Egyptians of the New Empire were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which had been standing for more than a thousand years.
The population of the City of the Vatican is of 800 persons. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily use for the majority of the population in the state, while the Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
It is necessary to have a knowledge of the basic chemical elements, such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, as well as the antimony, arsenic and copper, which are found in nature in their natural state and are relatively easy to extract.
Aristotel, a philosopher, proposes that the world is composed of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
The Assembly was held in the same order for the four States on the matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, and more, according to their theory, which states that they change into new substances that form something new that they see.
The alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. They do not have to comply with the periodic table.
The elements of calcium and potassium are considered metals. It is clear that there sont also other metals such as silver and gold.
Catalan also has the possibility of keeping allies who can provide small quantities of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The whole Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of atoms.
The atoms are so small that billions of atoms are needed to reach the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil will become a good friend of many people when it is invented.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a secondary status and to minor uses.
At present, on ne rédige plus de lettres sur papier, sans avoir besoin d'une machine à écrire.
It is possible to ask what will happen when the keyboard appears when the new moon rises.
The fusion bomb works by combining a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to the effort of pulling a heavy cart costs a lot. Separating the nucleus from the rest of this energy will cost a lot.
Some nuclei are unstable and tend to break up in a collision with a small or null particle.
The surface of the Moon is covered with rocks and craters. The outer layer of the Moon is called escorça.
The scrub measure 70 km in the proper part and 100 km in the lunar part.
The lunar phases are more pronounced in the lower areas and the mountains.
It may be that there are more lunar months visible on the face of the moon because the crust is more fragile. It is easier for the lava to come out to the surface.
The theories of content are centered on finding out what pleases or interests the people.
These theories suggest that people have needs and desires that have been internalized so that they mature at the age of adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want to do certain things and do other things that they will certainly do.
Two famous theories of content are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour that the administrators may begin to adopt in order to lead their predecessors. One extreme is to try to follow them "with a little more".
This type of commissioner has problems in taking unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, carrying out long-term investigations, assigning responsibility, and holding others responsible for his acts.
In the case of the opposition, the individual is transformed into an irrecusable being who feels that he must change everything that has been done by the equipment and the person in charge.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the operation.
This behaviour often ends in a showdown between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with some small differences.
The members of a virtual group will be able to function as a point of contact for their group immediately.
Catalan: 
The presence of an "invisible" facilitator (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible equipment" is the equipment administrator, who is to be addressed by each member.
Why would it be necessary to go through a long process of establishing an organization to promote adult education? One of the objectives of putting into practice the concept of adult education is innovation.
Creativity and innovation can emerge when all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of a functional organization.
As a consequence, the joint work of the two organizations could lead to a process of overcoming a difficult situation, which could be innovative in order to respond to the needs of the client.
In order for an organization to be innovative, the leader must create a culture of innovation, which includes knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the approach in detail in order to help organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data will provide physical proofs for a theoretical focus on cognitive research. In this way, the area of investigation will be reduced and the research will be more exact.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavior is supported by the scientific investigations.
It has been known for a long time that different types of damage, traumas, lesions and brain tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The new technologies allow us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain earlier than before.
This will provide us with a lot of information and material to build models that will help us to understand processes in our society.
The AI has strong connotations of science-fiction, and is a very important branch of computer science that studies behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research implies the development of machines that can perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
In these examples, we can see the control, the planning, the programming and the capacity to respond to the diagnostic and the questions of the client, as well as the recognition of the script, the reading and the signature.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The IA of the Arab world is frequently used in economic, medical, engineering and military fields, since it has been built in various domestic and video games applications.
The thematic subjects are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take her students to places that a bus trip would not be an option.
Technology offers a solution to the problem of virtual travel. Students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or enjoy the beauty of art while they are in class.
Sharing a virtual journey is also a good way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future students.
For example, each year, les étudiants de la Bennet School à Caroline du Nord créent un site web sur leur voyage à la capitale, chaque année, le site est actualisé, mais les anciennes versions sont conservées en ligne comme un livre de records.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. However, students should start by learning grammar and spelling, which can change with the existence of a public.
Students are often the most critical, so the blogger starts to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogs force students to be more astute with the world than the world is with them. The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be more curious and alert (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and expands learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriation of blogs by students may help them to be more analytical and critical; they can define their own positions in the context of the texts they write and also highlight their own perspectives in concrete issues by responding actively to the materials provided by the Internet (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting bilingual capital of Canada and has a series of art galleries and museums that show the past and present of Canada.
The south has the Niagara Falls and the north the natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
These are all the elements, among others, which make Ontario a city of excellence for foreigners.
The population of the large extensions of the north is more scarce, and some zones are still uninhabited.
For a comparison of populations that will be surprising: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The Eastern Islands of Africa are found off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the most different country, and a continent in itself, in terms of life expectancy.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France, and are known as tourist centres on the beach.
The Arabs also want to carry Islam to the lands, and they will take a great road to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European influence and colonialism will begin in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama will discover the route du Cap d'Europe à l'Inde.
North of the region, it borders the Sahel, and to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who is married should be considered a widow.
It is also useful to wear a ring (one that does not look like a wedding ring).
The women say that cultural differences can cause them to be considered as "different", and that they are not often prosecuted, beaten with the hand, etc.
Rebuts the homes with firmness, and we do not want to defend your position (either with or without cultural differences, it does not matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by fishermen from the Maghreb in the 10th century, and by Phoenicians, Romans and Berbers in the 5th century BC. It was named Anfa.
The Portuguese will destroy it and rebuild it under the name of White House, only after abandoning it in 1755.
The Sultan of Marrakech is going to rebuild the city with the name of Daru l-Badya, the name of Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who have established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting places to visit in Morocco.
The old Medina can be easily found by tourists looking for traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, terrissa, objects of pell, narguils, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it is not designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the extreme eastern part, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma will be destroyed by the lava of Nyiragongo, which will bury the majority of the roads of the city, especially the center.
If Goma is sufficiently secure, it would be advisable to investigate beforehand any visit outside the city to assess the state of the fighting in the Kivu North province.
The city is also the base for scaling the Nyiragongo Volcano and for some of the gorillas of the mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycles) for a trip to Goma. The normal fare (local) is 500 Congolese francs.
The combination of the inaccessibilité de la région et la métaphore de Timbuctu a abouti à une utilisation partielle de la région, les terres exotiques.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, and all that it has is converted into a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the 1990, it will be included in the list of World Heritage Sites in danger, due to the threat of the sand dunes.
One of the main defenses of the program "African Wonders" by Henry Louis Gates for PBS.
The city is different from the rest of the country because it has a more Arab air than African.
The Kruger National Park is situated in the north-east of South Africa and covers the border with Mozambique to the east, and with Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the border with Swaziland.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecozones, each with a different fauna.
It is one of the most important attractions of South Africa and is considered the reference of the national parks of South Africa (SANParks).
In South Africa, the entrance fee to all national parks is the same, regardless of the nationality of the visitor.
It is also possible to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry to a selection of parks in South Africa, including all the National Parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the territory of Hong Kong and it is the place that many tourists consider the main centre.
The group of buildings that make up the urban silhouette of Hong Kong has been related to a graphic of bars that is evident with the presence of the Victoria Harbour.
To obtain the best views of Hong Kong, he abandoned the island and went to the other side of the Kowloon Bay promenade.
The vast majority of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is concentrated in the coastal areas.
This is the place where the British colonists will settle, so it is a good starting point if you want to know something about the past colonial history of the territory.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Sundarbans territory is named Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only the pantans of the mangroves, but also include some of the last remaining patches of the powerful jungles that once covered the entire plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which 1,000 km² are covered by water.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for the survival of the Bengal tiger and it is estimated that there sont 400 tigres de Bengala réels et 30.000 tigres d'Asie.
The bus drivers of the interurban bus station (located on the other side of the river) work all day long, especially those who are in charge, and most of them go to Jakar/Bumthang.
Since the buses between districts often leave full, it is advisable to buy a ticket in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to move around the city, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The bridge of the Oyapock River is a bridge that attracts. It is located at the end of the Oyapock River, uniting the cities of Oiapoque with Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock with French Guiana.
The towers have a height of 83 metres, a length of 378 metres and two tracks of 3.50 metres in width.
The space will be opened up vertically, with a height of 15 metres. The construction will be completed in August 2011, so it will not be possible to cross it until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be fully functional in September 2017, when the Brazilian delegates will be in place.
The Guarani group is the most important indigenous group living in the Paraguay Oriental, and they also hunt and practice nomadic agriculture.
The Chaco region was the land of other indigenous groups such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering and fishing.
The Paraguay, formerly known as "Province des Îles", will be created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous groups.
Spanish: 
From the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has maintained a large part of its character and identity indigenous.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important polo tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Here too you can see smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about polo tournaments or to buy tickets for the matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Malvinas is the Malvinas Pound (FKP), equivalent to a British pound (GBP).
The dinners can be taken in the only restaurant on the islands, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West shop.
Generally, the British freeholders accept the arrears of rent and interest and also accept credit and dollars from the United States.
The islands in the periphery probably will not accept credit targets, although they can accept British pounds and American dollars; this was proved by the owners who were able to determine the method of payment in advance.
It is impossible to evade the currency of the Malvinas outside the islands, so that you must go there.
Montevideo is located in the southern hemisphere, and the hemisphere north of the equator is summer and the hemisphere south of the equator is winter.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures are usually above 30 °C.
Winter can be false cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "wet" or "dry" stations: the amount of rainfall is constant throughout the year.
Many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, but they are still wild animals and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the authorities of the park, the distance between the bones and the animals is at least 100 yards (meters) and the distance between the bones and the rest of the animals is at least 25 yards (meters).
In addition to the fact that it is difficult to imagine that a lion, a rhinoceros, an ant, a giraffe and all the large animals can attack, it is also difficult to imagine that they can be attacked by a lion, a rhinoceros, an ant, a giraffe and all the large animals.
Every year, hundreds of visitors are injured because they have not kept a sufficient distance. These animals are large, endangered and potentially dangerous, so they need their space.
I also want to point out that the odours of the bones and other animals that have been saved are also avoided, and that the camp site is kept clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of 40,000 inhabitants.

The beaches are abundant, as Auckland is the horse of two ports. The most popular ones are located in three zones.
The beaches of North Shore (district of North Harbour) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
Most of them are trees of the pohutukawa, and most of them have shadow thanks to the pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches are Mission Bay and St Heliers Bays, and expensive barges in Mission Bay and Central Auckland.
These are small, family-run shops with a good range of goods along the coast. They are safe.
The most famous local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but it is refreshing and pleasant. The other local beer is "Manta".
They can drink a lot of French wines, but the wines of New Zealand and Australia will not tolerate the journeys.
It is the water of the local well, but if it is bottled, it is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of tallat is foreign. A café corto is a café express, the barista is heavily laden with cream (without foam), and the coffee is served without milk.
Chocolate is above Belgian standards. The fruit juices are excellent but the quality of chocolate is excellent.
