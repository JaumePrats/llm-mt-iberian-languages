In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathery, a theory that is already widely accepted, the fossils also provide specific data that fossils generally do not, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this bird has a brownish-red plumage on the upper part and a pale or caroteneous color on the lower part.
Moreover, the discovery helps to understand better the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur plumage lacks a well-developed axis, called the rakish, but has other feather features (hairs and bristles), the researchers came to the conclusion that the rakish is probably the result of an evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but to regulate body temperature or as an indicator of the same. The researchers say that, although the tail feather of a young dinosaur is being analyzed, the sample has the characteristics of an adult's plumage and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

The 16th of February is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are due to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21, died. Alden was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries in the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed a facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun jammed as he aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, he has one eye, part of his skull is missing and his face was reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual races of the tournament apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he obtained a "Did not finish the first race", as well as 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four slalom skiers in the category did not complete their races and a total of 45 slalom Giant participants did not reach the classification in the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh recovered the laptop and the mobile phone stolen.
The deputy inspector general, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to the superintendent of police, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver of the Audi TT red.
Initially, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court, accused of the murder of her son.
While she is under custody awaiting trial and the verdict, any witness's testimony can be questioned, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as Scottish justice works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said: "It seems journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is responsible for processing, said it would not make any further comments until the case is heard.
According to the information that has been leaked, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve based on the pre-1967 borders.
Other topics that were also discussed, according to information provided, included the future status of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the complementary pest control trial, the game wardens had to supervise the shooters closely, since this was being monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the NSW Association of Sporting Shooters, volunteers were recruited from within the Association's membership.
Mick O'Flynn, who is temporarily in charge of the Conservation and Heritage Office of the NPWS, said that a comprehensive training and safety course was provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures that aim to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The protests, at times violent, were triggered by the fact that elections were not held, in some cases since 2011.
About 60 iPods have been reported with problems of malfunctioning and overheating, which caused six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry said it was disappointed by Apple's delay in submitting its report, saying it was "truly lamentable."
Mariana was shaken by a quake at 7:19 p.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The emergency management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands said there were no reports of damage on the territory.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer kidnapped a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
The six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed early.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began his research on premature birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua reported Wednesday that the government investigators were able to retrieve the flight data recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She died the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro en Polvo Runnels said: "Luna was as strange as I am, even more so. I love her and I miss her. I hope she's in a better place."
Between 2008 and 2010, the number of people who said they would vote against a republic increased by 8%.
Julia Gillard, interim prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ended.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
On one end of the survey, 29% of people think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; on the other, 31% think it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist in the 100-meter freestyle and 200-meter freestyle events and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned after his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers to relieve the pain, because their use is prohibited in the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using various types of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and support life.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets are formed, in particular our own, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the start of the year and signed a law last month that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He dismissed the rumours as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce flight distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel a year, as well as carbon emissions.
Satellite technology is used in contrast to the old radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate data.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, it was considered the possibility of playing the game closed, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the Science magazine reported on a new species of bird discovered in the Galápagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden revealed that the new species evolved in just two generations, much faster than expected, due to the reproduction of a Darwin's endemic pigeon, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus-migrating pigeon, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
It is not only possible to hammer and roll into sheets, but also to stretch it until it becomes a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it could be used to decorate the illustrations made by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will change depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product being analyzed determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Therefore, a hydrogen ion is the result of removing a proton from an electron.
Mix both dry powders together and, after doing so, with clean and wet hands, form a ball.
A reaction will occur between the moisture on your hands and the outer layers of your skin, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage in almost all the houses, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and the view we have.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster way to travel.
Thanks to her we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small carnivores (including domestic cats) that feed on species of small size that are much more abundant, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the big cats that most socialise and their life takes place in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males of the same family group, up to thirty females and their calves.
Generally, females are very close to each other, which makes them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides have the same behaviour as wolf packs or dogs, with whom they share a surprising similarity (unlike the other large felids) in their behaviour and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
The tiger is a very strong animal, it can climb trees, swim, jump very high and pull five times stronger than a strong man.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not a full-bodied roar like that of the lion, but rather a series of words spoken in growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy eating small creatures. In most cases, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of their prey will be much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) using their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark and, in addition, they move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living things (a population) moves away from the main group from which it came (for example, if it moved to a mountain range or a river, or if it moved to a new island so that it could not easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment to that which it was used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, so a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
No changes have been made to the original population, which still needs the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, as the growing population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble less and less the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable and fundamental consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they exhale).
Plants produce food with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. They also offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and we also make clothes from them. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, therefore, it had nothing to fear, except from other members of its own species.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth, as well as another group in the palate, which means that anything that came in front of him, had no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a viperine. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and even could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a dinosaur as large as the T. Rex was no match for him.
While most of that food would be familiar to us today, the Romans also ate some rather unconventional items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that distinguished the rich and the women from the poor and the men was that the rich and the women ate sitting down, while the poor and the men ate standing up.
It is impossible that the recipes of the ancient Rome included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no maize, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao, and no Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to satisfy their needs by celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramidal towers were built, called ziggurats, to form part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the patio; shops were only showrooms that opened onto the street. Houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to Nordic sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
However, despite his discovery, the Eskimos had already inhabited the area at that time.
While each country was Scandinavian, there were marked differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. While the reverse of the document contains something written, it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has the words "Declaration of Independence original of July 4, 1776" written on its reverse. The text is on the lower part of the document, facing down.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that the huge document of parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
Although the D-Day landings had achieved the liberation of the north of France, the south still remained to be liberated.
His government was in the hands of the French Vichy, which was a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon began, the Allied invasion of southern France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a specific culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and relates both to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city state, and which, in some way, determines the size of the society.
State cities are the precursors of nations. A culture of civilization entails a long-term generational transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogeneous propagation.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces, and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, in the beginning, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and since it lacked a national executive or judicial power, the function fell to the states, which often did not cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
He was not empowered to annul fiscal laws or customs between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval of all the states for their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second team in the world with the most victories and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic events.
There are about 7,000 islands in Japan, the largest of which is Honshu.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago," from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who were sailing in the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labour to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty army took control of the northern and western coastal regions of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this area as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and work continues today.
For example, the most common format for fixed-lens photography is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the era of film photography.
Today it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship has been transferred to the formats of digital image sensors in cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its measurements are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest ratio of integers) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (for example, the APS format group) are similar or very similar to this aspect relationship.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times ridiculed, is a simple rule that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing some order to be given to the images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting the European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected all, from the king to the people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be used for that specific purpose.
The central cupola of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder if this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such measures violated the generally recognized and contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain is extracting water from the whole of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany thought it would meet a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at Edison in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poems and a recommendation letter written by Charles Batchelor (his last manager) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different time periods. Each dynasty or each ruling family constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
These have many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, the posts were opened to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same thing happens with the military, since now the charges of the army are based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the working class who were repressed in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He used to visit a cave called "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has endured in time, realistically illustrates the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
On the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains in the surroundings. From the inside of this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century BC, is one of the many pyramids of large size and pyramid shape built to worship the deceased pharaoh.
The Necropolis of Guiza, or "Valley of the Dead", in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids and smaller tombs and temples were built in honor of his wives and family.
The "upward arrow" mark resembles a V and the "downward arrow" mark resembles a square or a rectangle without its bottom edge.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull the bow.
The ascending arc produces a softer sound, while a descending arc is more forceful and abrupt.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but don't forget that marks on string instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose and should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Teresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4) and his sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a executed guard in front of the queen, who was terrified.
The Filipino people themselves paid the expenses of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the expenses and interest on the bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Filipino government in the Wall Street banks.
From the very beginning, the long-term profits derived from the exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of profits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in which these events took place is known as the Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300 (that is, between the years 1000 and 1300 d. C.).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
The technological determinism is a concept that includes, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on an independent path from any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a reduced number of cars, so new techniques of manufacturing are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of automobiles also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, which leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography moulded people and, with the passing of time, customs and cultures developed that were related to that geography, which, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to arbitrary laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital today, Constantinople was considered as such in the feudal Europe.
Its fame as the centre of luxury began approximately in 400 BC and extended until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its status declined, especially due to the return of the Crusaders, who brought back silk and spices, which were valued more highly than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "fashion capital" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the dress received great influence from the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western styles could take a delay of 25 to 30 years.
In the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of this period was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is understood as that which aims to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of seeds from the region's original ecological region with crop rotation and other relatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers' main activity was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginality from the social standards and gives them the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of its members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical, or related to religion or politics, or a combination of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic style by using distinctive and symbolic dress, gestures, and language.
One of the most common mechanisms for graphically representing the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild." Some wild children are confined by their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children have suffered traumatic or severe child abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived in the wild.
When a child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, he or she exhibits behaviors (within his or her physical capabilities) almost equal to those of the specific animal that cared for him or her, as well as his or her fear or indifference toward people.
Although learning based on projects should make the process easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a little further.
Andamiaje is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new software program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also a small animated subject from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been difficult for the student to understand on their own.
Children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family system provides a safe environment for these children.
Our goal is to provide safe, loving foster homes, consistent tutoring, and reliable medical care.
The purpose of family placement is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home from which the child was removed.
The Internet is a combination of components of mass communication and between people.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of the reactions of users to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), participation and long-term relationships were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that, by reading their microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech due to a brain injury can, nevertheless, evaluate sincerity with precision.
He also suggests that the skills for interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been demonstrated that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation from one generation to the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is similar to that of humans, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available.
Not doing so can cause serious problems: stunted growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
Proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digested by primates like us, except when cooked.
However, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
The interruption of sleep consists in waking up intentionally during the normal sleep period and then falling asleep again after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a soft alarm clock that wakes you up without waking you up completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before going to bed, which will make you get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The more the tension is reduced, the more positive is the force of life with which we are endowed. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. The only thing that blocks the way is our tension and negativity.
While the basis of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread along the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of yoga from India.
In general, laísmo is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated with yoga poses, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be cleared, the chakras activated and the consciousness of enlightenment developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the system, process and culture clashes ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and would be fought in reality, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that by September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, its only hope was to retreat and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian head of bridge.
However, these plans soon fell into disuse, as more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to guarantee that its country retains the ability to transport its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The Atlantic campaign in World War II offers one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this circulation.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did in other European countries.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the purpose of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and skin, the ancient peoples and tribes started to take them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills and other areas of pasture, tended by herdsmen who were often children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, railways had been installed in the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and carry heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The introduction of sleepers to keep the rails in place was carried out quite early. However, gradually it was realised that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although iron wheels caused greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767 iron rails were used for the first time.
The first form of transport known was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live a more friendly life with the planet, join environmentalist movements or even become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, the future suffering.
In many cases, it is like the asymptomatic treatment. But if we are not looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is obvious that the world has undergone great changes, due to the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, 1776, the Declaration was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, in a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap copies."
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time in the patio of the Independence Hall, on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered that it be read to his army in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. They are birds.
Many people do not represent them as dinosaurs, since they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers work based on the manipulation of data coded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be evident immediately. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to allow a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is finding an open bottle of medicines or cleaning chemicals containing toxic chemicals.
Read the label for specific information about first aid for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasite in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with fleas, a species very developed to parasitize humans.
The bedbugs and the clothes moths are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is estimated to be around 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve, is the object of attack in multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicate that women have twice the chances of men to suffer from EM.
A couple could conclude that raising a child would not be the most convenient thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to adopt a baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
However, it is not an experiment, it is a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on the classical works; especially, in the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those of science, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, Western civilization distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, even in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate autonomously and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA was a type of genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they marked the DNA of the fungus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the DNA with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected DNA segment, and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation may have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wild animal and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the place are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and gathering information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transfer vehicle, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists support the view that this massive economy of carbon has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the last two million years.
We are all part of society and use the transport systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear such complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such complaints and why do failures occur daily? Are the engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study traffic flow, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to be represented approximately by mathematical models.
In order to graphically represent the flow, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate both planning and design as well as the operations of the road devices.
The first flying insects were able to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, pressing them against their bodies.
This provides a wider range of possible small hiding places for predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus suggested that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth we do not perceive its movement, right?
The Amazon River is the longest and second largest river in the world. It contains eight times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some points with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water that comes from the world's rivers and ends up in the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6,387 km (3,959 mi) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of the Guiza pyramids.
The ancient Egyptian city of the New Kingdom was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the least populated.
Italian is used in the Vatican City for drafting its legislation and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that most people working in the state use daily is Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
The total number of citizens living in the Vatican City who adhere to the Catholic religion is 1,000.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
He had a greater resemblance to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but at the same time he had the theory that they transform into new substances that form the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be the elements such as calcium and potassium. Already, there are metals of the type of gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metals.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of very small particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Therefore, when the pencil was invented, it gained many friends.
Unfortunately, due to the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They don't even need to approach a pencil.
The only question is what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which tend to decompose with the minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km in the near side and about 100 km in the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more lakes in the nearby area due to the thinner crust, which made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These theories hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew up to reach maturity.
These theories analyze what causes people to want certain things and what factors in their environment make them want or not to do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum is the attempt to continue being "one of the guys" (or girls).
The managers in this category have difficulty making decisions that are unpopular with employees, imposing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and demanding accountability from staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes it necessary to change everything that the group has been doing until now and do it their way.
In the end, the success and failure of the team is the leader's responsibility.
This type of behavior often distances the leaders from the rest of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team act as a point of contact for their physical closest team.
Generally, they enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because their teams can meet at different times, which may not be understood by the local management.
The existence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of managing and to which each member reports. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
What reason could an organization have for submitting to the process of establishing an organization for learning? One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation.
When all the resources available are used appropriately in the operational departments of an organization, space is created for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that an organization that works as a team to overcome a place-based difficulty to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
To make an organization innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data offer factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and increase its accuracy.
The correlation existing between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the possibility to see and investigate structures and processes that have never been seen before in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important field within computer science, which deals with the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostic and customer queries, facial recognition, handwriting recognition, voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on offering solutions to real-world problems.
Artificial Intelligence is now used in many sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and military, as well as in various applications of video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours. Students can observe the objects exhibited in a museum, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet Elementary School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are archived as an online scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with a lack of grammar and spelling, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Because students are the readers who most criticize, the blogger begins to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogging requires students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to the contents of the Internet, they can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and establish their perspectives on specific topics.
Ottawa is the bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the country's history and current affairs.
The Niagara Falls are located more south and north hosts the natural beauty without exploiting Muskoka and the extension that follows.
These aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The northernmost areas are sparsely populated and some are wild lands, almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that causes great surprise to many: in the United States there are more African Americans than Canadians.
The location of the islands of Eastern Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wild life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, in large part, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The first European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route that links Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women must be aware that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round to reject men and do not fear to defend your position (cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century and the Phoenicians, Romans and Greeks used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of Casa Branca, but in 1755 it was abandoned after the occurrence of an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed VI with the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina, there are many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan goods, such as earthenware pots, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, although everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left most of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is generally safe, any trip outside the city should be considered to take stock of the situation in the Kivu province of North.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its gorilla trekking excursions are some of the most affordable in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can take a motorcycle taxi (mototaxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and distant image.
Although today Tombuctú is a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included in the World Heritage List, due to the threat posed by the encroaching sands.
It was one of the most important stops on the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has a surface of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecozones, in each of which a different wild life is developed.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognised as the main icon of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African nature reserves, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
It is also convenient to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to selected parks in South Africa or to all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
The Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a bar chart that shows the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to Kowloon Bay, located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where its urban development is concentrated, densely.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see proof of the colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The section of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangroves, but also some of the last trees that remain of the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3,850 km2 and about a third of its area is covered by water or swamp.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a temple of the wild life and it is estimated that in the area there are 400 tigers of Bengal and 30 000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the bus station in Thimphu (the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the Coaster Japanese buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a bridge that crosses the river, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes of 3.5 m width.
Below the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, which is when it is expected that Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that currently constitutes the east of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The region was inhabited by other aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The giant province of the Indies," was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spaniards began the stage of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its aboriginal identity and culture.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and best players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower-level games are also played throughout the year.
On the Association Argentina de Polo website you will find information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo games.
The Falkland Islands pound (FKP) is the official currency of the Falkland Islands. It is pegged to the British pound at a rate of 1 FKP = 0.5 GBP.
There is only one bank on the islands. It is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling is accepted in most places on the islands. In Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
There are chances that in the islands of the periphery they do not accept credit cards, but they could use British or American money. Ask in advance to the owners to be able to define which is the accepted payment method.
It is practically impossible to change money outside the Falkland Islands, so do it before you leave.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: while it is very rare that temperatures fall below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rain is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild life is still wild, so do not feed it or disturb it.
According to the authorities of the parks, it is recommended to maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals.
Although they may appear gentle, bears, wolves, moose, and most large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors suffer injuries each year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid cooking foods that release a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of around 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. About two hundred Americans and Germans were killed.
During the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the state's leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches in Auckland, due to the fact that the city has two ports. The most famous ones are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district, in the Pacific Ocean, are the beaches of North Shore, which extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all of sand with safe swimming areas and most have pohutukawa trees which provide shade.
In the Waitemata Harbour, the beaches of Tamaki Drive unfold in the extravagant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the local beer most popular and is not complicated, but rather refreshing and pleasant. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, New Zealand and Australian wines may be considered better for transport.
The local water from the tap is completely safe for consumption, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the notion of "white coffee" foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and, there, wounds by any of these causes are rare.
However, you should still take the advice of the authorities, respect all the signs and pay special attention to security alerts.
The Portuguese man-of-war is found near beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where actively live the saltwater crocodiles. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
The reservation of accommodation in advance gives you the peace of mind that you will have a place to stay when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, but through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
You can also save the reservation in case you need time to think better about the offer, or to obtain other documents for your destination (for example, the visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, most of those who attend the events decide to camp at the place and most of the spectators consider that it is a crucial aspect of the experience.
If you want to see the action, then you should arrive early at the camp to get a place close to the musical events.
It is important to note that, although the musical performances may have ended, in other areas of the festival they may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is located, as crossing the ice causes a lot of noise for those most affected.
During the cruises through St. Petersburg, you also spend time in the city. Those who disembark are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Normally, casinos make great efforts to maximize the time and money that their customers spend. Generally, there are no windows or clocks and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drink and entertainment promotions to keep guests happy and within the premises.
Some establishments serve free alcoholic drinks. Although drunkenness affects judgment and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Any person who intends to drive in high latitudes or in mountain passes must foresee the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy or snow-covered roads, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as you do on the bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, you can get so much snow that you get trapped in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by snow or ice that forms on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, in many countries, the conditions of ice and snow are normal and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable part of many visitors' trips.
The term safari is used to refer to the popular African safaris, where you can see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, will approach the vehicles and the standard equipment will provide good visibility.
Sometimes leopards, lions and jaguars can be shy, so you will have a better chance of seeing them using binoculars.
The safari known as walking safari (also known as "hiking", "safari of the bush", "walking" or "hike") consists of walking, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. A number of events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo was the host city of the 1964 Summer Olympics, the first Asian city to host the Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, there may be complications.
