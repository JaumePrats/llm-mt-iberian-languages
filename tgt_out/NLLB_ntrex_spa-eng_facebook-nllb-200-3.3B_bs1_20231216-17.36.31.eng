Welsh Assembly Members (AMs) are concerned about looking like muppets
Some Members of the Assembly are baffled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament for Wales (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Assembly Member stated that his group was concerned that it rhymed with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A Welsh Party Assembly Member commented that his whole group was 'discontent' and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party claimed that his group was open to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name change, states: Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the designation of the Assembly Members will be a matter for the members themselves.
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed widespread support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option won the most support in a public consultation.
It appears that Members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, to her head, who should send the bill concerning the changes in a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Assembly Members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say on the question of what they should be called when they deliberate on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's keep silent because of the hardships of Harlem's churches.
'Historically, the elderly people I have spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,' says Mr Adams.
Today, there is neither one nor the other.
He noted that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize differently now", he says.
Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms that neighbors go to regularly.
With respect to the churches, he worries that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope and that sooner or later, they will return to the starting point.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who will not help the shrines that remain in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, he claimed, and therefore will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930's.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins at St. Martin's, under the leadership of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, and while Father Johnson's parishioners were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the carillon.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin, proudly called it "the poor man's campaigns".
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan noted that it was the world's first carillon used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left to play the larger Riverside Church carillon 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What's happened in St. Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on their concern that the diocese was trying to pass costs to the board, although the board had not participated in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters in California
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the locust season, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child crying for help, so he approached with a group to pull him out of the water.
Hammel commented that at first he thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then he realized it was screaming that he had been bitten.
"Hammel observed as he came to the boy's side.
'I shouted at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark,' Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but had not been considered a threatened species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to boost the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialized employees in the halls of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK's £2.8 trillion beauty market, with growth increasing in comparison to falling fashion and homeware sales, the largest beauty aisles will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and, if successfully overtaken, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the shelf space that used to be for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's stated it would double its beauty offering with up to 3000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be testing its concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second, which will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift towards buying small amounts of food daily from local stores are forcing supermarkets to work hard to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has claimed that stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as the supermarket chain attempts to combat discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets into hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago, which is believed to have boosted grocery sales and further profited these acquisitions.
The supermarket chain's previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's piloted a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion over how to split revenues from pharmaceutical outlets in its supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's 281 pharmaceutical shops to Celesio, the company which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: 'We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles in ways that enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a dedicated staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and our attractive environment and convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks an £11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, left furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke an £11 million deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to devote to the fashion and accessories brand Truly.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, star of Dragon's Den, by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "furious" when the golden girl of television admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was being touted as a front-runner to double Willoughby's fortune of around £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain for one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, what would sustain her for the next two decades.
His decision to quit left everyone involved utterly stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters, products ready to go on sale.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to significant investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, and possibly delay its launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have been in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples were on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones claimed that last night "no business issues were discussed".
A difficult conversation and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented in his mocking voice of "news anchorman".
I haven't given up anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting with him again after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an "appropriate response" from the US to the first steps towards North Korea's disarmament.
The EU has also been working with the UN to develop a comprehensive strategy for the Middle East.
Trump's perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
"We get along great with North Korea", he said.
We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a fantastic relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: an end to missile testing, help in freeing hostages and bringing the remains of American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this packed stadium, we'd have about 200 people right here", Trump remarked, pointing to the people who were right in front of him.
An island in Indonesia is devastated by a tsunami and earthquake, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had been displaced, a national emergency was not declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
'Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, which complicates things a bit,' explains Ms Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to be sent to Palu, they are not yet sure if the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide aid.
Considering that the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its wrath.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, you don't see as many in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was an advance warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling from one Indonesian island to another presents a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster enclave.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and rail lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who faces re-election next year.
In addition, it must cope with the pressure of Indonesia's persistent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Check this out, Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool equals the goal against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 yards from Chelsea's goal as the score was 1-0.
He put the ball in his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second stick.
The action sent him over the area and headed towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop it with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very forward, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I gave him a touch.
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midfielder made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic on that play, before turning to make a dribble near the midfield and entering the Liverpool pitch.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice pass to the space that got Hazard in the end zone.
Hazard moved in front of the defence and ended up throwing the ball into the second-post net with a left-footed kick that Liverpool's Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League.
Chelsea are set to face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday that unleashed waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: 'The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who has been in the vicinity of Jonh Street, Birkenhead, and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
Also, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on the dashcam to contact us, as they may have information vital to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who believe they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but police tell him no one can enter or leave the building.
He was stunned when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are being informed that they will be allowed back in in a few hours.
Someone overheard an officer tell a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
She keeps saying, "That's terrible".
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents stood within the cordon, controlling the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to email DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, registration 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament becomes the latest commemorative success for "re-writing history"
Its banning would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that removing the figure of Oliver Cromwell from the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, over the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century view and part of the historiography of a figure many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy.
If this is a totally accurate description, it is a matter for further historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents one face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A killer pig attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a cattle farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pigsty in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby barn was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood in its mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-kilogram pig had attacked the rancher to death, according to the report.
My cousin's legs were bloodied and bruised, the cousin, who is addressed by his surname, Wu, told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, it is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig cornered a cattle farmer on his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... their intention is not to harm.
What needs to be done is to have the proper respect for them", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rainfall widespread across the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa produced wind gusts of over 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday at five in the morning (Eastern time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are beginning to build, moving eastward towards the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push intense tropical rains northward, towards the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will drop more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical rain collides with the approaching low pressure, there will be heavy widespread precipitation in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between two and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause precipitation of nearly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between two and three inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, flash floods with conditions that worsen rapidly are possible.
Because of this threat of torrential tropical rains, it is not recommended at all to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into raging rivers and storms will cause gusty winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rainfall in specific parts of the Southern California coastline.
Torrential rains can leave up to two inches of water, which could cause small debris flows and make roads slippery.
It would be the region's first torrential rains during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rain becomes widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes in the United States may be observed due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes this involves drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the central United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to see a warm October start, with temperatures generally hovering around 26 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could see temperatures reach up to 80 degrees, about 40 degrees above average.
Our long-range forecast indicates high probabilities of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's appearance.
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, on six television networks Thursday.
Meanwhile, politics remained deadlocked and the media interrupted its regular programming to relay Friday's latest news: a deal engineered by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while drunk and that he tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that had not happened.
It's likely that more than the 20.4 million people Nielsen was talking about on Friday saw it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other channels that rebroadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has some trouble calculating how many people are watching something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience similar to a football game, or the playoffs, or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose members have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the top-rated channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day appearance, Nielsen noted.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the hearing, great interest continued to be shown.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters shouting at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Judiciary Committee.
As he received these reproaches, broadcast live on CNN, he was devastated.
"Looking me in the face", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
And she went on to say, "You have power when so many women don't".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would say more at his appearance before the commission.
The cable and broadcast networks broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the following week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was pivotal, as it became clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politicising' Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "policy-making" over Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham (Great Britain) on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his own on the front page of the paper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers' alleged Brexit plan, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was totally absurd.
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Bail has been set at $350,000, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge East District Court of Inquiry issued a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
The department acknowledges the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police forensics laboratory, Southern University police and the public for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU athletic director, thanked the area police forces for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2, 195-pound player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that his team is "devastated" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"These are the things people always worry about", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods south of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shaking.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 45 miles southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after independence protesters clashed with riot police as thousands of people took part in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by riot police threw eggs and paint dust at them, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also clashes in the later hours and the police used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with messages like ni olvido ni perdón, clashed with unionist protesters to the cry of Viva España.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout was low, as those opposed to secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes occurred.
Independence groups camped out Friday night to avoid a rally in support of the National Police.
The demonstration went ahead, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we are stuck", she said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in last December's regional elections, pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in next year's European Parliament elections.
'Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish Government', he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for ramming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a Londonderry home with a car.
The incident occurred Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. at Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the entrances and the building itself.
At some point, it's possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
A strike by Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win.
A promoted Livingston impressed Rangers by taking the second loss to Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, Gary Holt's up one place, with Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard's have yet to win a game away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who are leading the table by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their winning streak in the division to six games as head coach Holt has yet to taste defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston passes up opportunities in the face of a forceful visitor.
Holt's team had to have gone one step ahead long before they scored, causing all sorts of trouble for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson overpowered the defense, but missed his attempt in front of goal, and then Alan Lithgow got the shot off after coming in to finish Craig Halkett's head-centre in front of goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems for the visitors with the standing ball plays.
That's how the deciding goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free throw and Livingston sought an inning, with a combined play from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers were dominating the possession, but they couldn't get past the home defence and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop on Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor fought off a Scott Pittman shot with a single kick, and Lithgow was kept off another play by Livingston.
The Livingston area was consistently filled with long passes, but they were always cleared, and two penalty calls were denied, one after an inning by Halkett on substitute Glenn Middleton and another for a hand.
The Livingston phenomenon (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for the Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they played an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and roster have hardly experienced any changes since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has reinforced the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some very good times with Gerrard, they were short-lived.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to penetrate the opposing field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky at the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at re-establishing relations between the NATO allies.
They discussed issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents, many of them Kurds, also spoke out, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisiveness of this visitor, greeted as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the junction of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy Deptford road, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by paramedics, but died on the spot.
The accident comes after another cyclist was killed after being hit by a hit-and-run vehicle on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the scene of Saturday's crash.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation at a high-security men's prison, according to the prison's management.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9.30am on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from an elite team (called Tornado) are taking over the altercations, involving eight inmates and affecting a pavilion.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman comments: Specialised prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing Long Lartin Prison incident.
Six staff members have received medical attention for injuries.
Violence is not tolerated in our prisons and we made it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time behind bars.
Long Lartin Prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical attention after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, riot police were asked to come to the prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It's rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen early next week as the last of Hurricane Rosa's winds sweep across the desert's southwest, with the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rainfall late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only ten hurricanes had retained their tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between two and three inches of torrential rain, which can reach six inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Escarpment in Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be between 2 and 5 centimeters, with the possibility of up to 10 in isolated locations, in other areas of the desert's southwest, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of flash floods, the Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious matter, it is likely that some of these torrential rains are beneficial because of the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum gusts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is encountering colder waters in the Pacific, so it's losing strength.
It is expected to make landfall in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm later on Monday afternoon.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
 Torrential rainfall of between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a possibility of up to 25 centimeters, as reported on weather.com.
Afterward, Rosa will head northward from Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Subsequently, it will move across Arizona into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main danger from Rosa or its remnants is heavy torrential rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert, says the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital, where he remains stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested that night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
Agents have issued a call to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, "Americans saw the cunning, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished jurists of our day, a jurist with an admirable record of public service", he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy when speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to go before one of the most important decisions of our lives.
I don't introduce myself, but it is a race, she said.
That's why I go from place to place fighting to get great candidates.
Trump alleged that Democrats are embarking on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number rising
At least 384 people have died and many more have been swept away by huge waves that ravaged beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach in Palu city on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When a tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it swept away cars, logs, houses, everything on land", Nugroho said.The tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed into the trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT, for its acronym in Indonesian) reported in a statement that the energy released by Friday's big earthquake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the city's geography, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as important and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings.
Nugroho noted that the death toll and damage could be higher along the 300 km coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse", he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for not reporting that a tsunami had struck Palu, though officials claim the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a video captured by a fan and shared on social media, a man can be heard standing on the top floor of a building warning people on the street of an approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately validate the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in and around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials say, but evacuees still need food and other basic goods.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have safely reached Palu city, where employees take shelter under tarps installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating picture on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen many houses destroyed", he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as relief groups were putting the wheels of disaster relief in motion, some people were complaining that experienced aid workers were not being allowed to move to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level catastrophe", commented Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn't happened yet
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the people still missing still held out hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would shed some light on the grim stories written by natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled out of a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days alongside her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor for Indonesia's national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
Because of my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional load, he commented.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the spread of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the competitors from Palu, who were participating in the festival being held on the beach.
However, his messages only showed one grey checkmark, not two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during a charge at an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a Brink employee who was topping up an ATM in Newport on the Levee was robbed by robbers, who took $26,750, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the recreation center and was preparing to top it off with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man came running up behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of the money for the refill.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the place, but the police did not specify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going by the name Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: The person formerly known as Kanye West.
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time, a name he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to present her new album, Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons", as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance to him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'", West said earlier this year while discussing the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
It's you, it's us, it means us.
He went from being Kanye, which means "the one", to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the many famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has used his name in uppercase or lowercase, with or without hyphenation.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico's president-elect, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, as the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students in the country approaches.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised at Plaza Tlatelolco that he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were gaining ground across Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after the AI-related announcements from various parts of the US government, even as the US generally lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are lagging far behind the US. We are looking at the next breakthrough in the field of AI", Lee says.
Double funding means double the chance that the next big thing in AI will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that beat the best American Othello player.
Lee acknowledged previous US government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
It's not China that's taking away academic leaders; it's corporations, Lee noted.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent people from universities to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the US step up its AI initiatives.
I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically, he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of Next Generation Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people from academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners from industry and academia.
Also, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, which is majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether turnout will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum ballot asked: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for everyone", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that, as of 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
'I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe', said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in Macedonia's referendum on a name change that would open the way to joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
'We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door,' said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to join like Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20%.
'I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research assured that between 30 and 43 percent of voters were going to participate in the referendum, which is less than the required participation.
Another poll by Telma TV in Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch this: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, bypasses the entire Brighton defence to score a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence in the 2-0 victory Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the play.
He ran through three Brighton defenses before he went into open court.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He dodged a defender before overtaking several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Agüero has some foot problems", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the early lead in the Premier League contest.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
On that play, Aguero received the ball well within Brighton's territory.
He made a nice pass to left flank Leroy Sane.
Sane gave it a few touches before directing Sterling to the second stake.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net just before he went out of bounds.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to throw the Rockies a party.
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mound Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who swept the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still have a chance in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least a wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still chasing their first division title.
Even if we don't play each other, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but it looks like they're inclined to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, did a practice session Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander's record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump gives a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court selection, when speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
November is all we've done.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
It is one of the most important. I do not run, but it is a race, so I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates, he said.
And he went on: "We have this terrible group of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the meanness, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he claimed, are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"We've seen it these last four days", he said, saying the Democrats "were angry, they were evil, they were horrible and they were fake".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received public outcry.
Do you remember his answer?
Are you filtering the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, mmm, I'm waiting for an answer.
The Labour Party already embraces a wide range of views.
He 's intolerant of people who say what they think .
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a long line of Labour MPs to be told that I am not welcome, and that is just for saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way as if she were categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the no-confidence motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, which ironically were issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour Party meeting, 'We want meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
For most of the eight years that I have been a local Labour Member of Parliament, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy is already more than forgotten, if it was ever actually implemented.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he once thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and take positions he would never have agreed with, whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there's a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the centre's policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and with every "no-confidence" motion or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I've received a lot of advice that I should keep my head down and not make so much noise and that it would be okay.
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my all-boys' school classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
It is impossible that anyone in Nottingham East was unaware of my political stances or the areas in which I disagreed with the current leadership.
The only thing I would say to those who pushed the motion on Friday is that I don't understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is headed for a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services.
The real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two late attempts may have decided the final score to some extent, but Ayr certainly deserved victory in this hilarious Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team out of the ten that participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defense, as well as their ability to make better use of opportunities, that gave the home team the victory, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
We have been tested in all the matches and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy, he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose commented: "The Ayr deserves the credit, they took the opportunities better than we did".
A 14th-minute try by Grant Anderson, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage from the opponent and Jason Baggot got a non-converted try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, just at halftime, he scored and converted a solo try, which left the score at 17-5 in Ayr's favour at half-time.
However, the Melrose started the second half well and the try of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced this gap to five points.
There was a long break afterwards with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off on a stretcher, and, as the match resumed, Ayr took the lead with a Stafford McDowall try converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Ayr captain Blair Macpherson allowed the Melrose to take advantage again of having one more man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when Struan Hutchinson was shown the yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made a try when he was on the back of the forward maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost since the match resumed, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's ball from a kick and sent winger Gregor Henry to the back to take the fifth try from the locals.
The star of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to make the leap into the restaurant industry after it was revealed that he has been named the CEO of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it appears that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source in the Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "burgeoning restaurant market".
The sea belongs to us: a landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors are guarding a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, blue flags are waving.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the motto: "The sea is ours by right,
To get it back is a duty.
Across Bolivia, a land without a sea, people still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, as well as the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes may be the highest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution from the International Court of Justice by October 1, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision, commented Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is fighting a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has much to say about Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he promised by the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision comes only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from advancing Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have stifled it.
The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, said Zárate.
Furthermore, he suggested that Morales' belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process be unusually quick.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
Resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean foreign minister, says his nation will never be the first to complete nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the US to keep promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic nuclear talks that have been stalled for more than three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subdue the North, is a chimera.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without Pyongyang first making some significant disarmament move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you.
If you want to add to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun entirely, look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a set of eccentric oversized hats for their 2019 spring-summer collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories were jewelled watermelons, a witch's hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lipstick sewn on and were more Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a complete diving suit, snorkel and goggles included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion hunters predict that the giant hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
The big hats come stamping on the hand of La Bomba, with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this very impractical hat that flooded social media featured another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag as big as the swimsuit model wearing it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle, was the centerpiece of Jacquemus' La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "Next summer, I expect to see huge hats and beach bags on shopping streets. Since the designer has had such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary test scores that is reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, the arts, music and other community projects.
With over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the highest standard of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further higher education, for their chosen career and for their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head".
If you speak to him in his language, it goes to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely on English alone.
If we take into account the recent results of this year's examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables, with the highest pass rates in the independent schools.
In total, 68% of pupils who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centres that are part of SCIS, showed that 72% of students were getting an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish were also getting an A.
This shows that the independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered to be on a par with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools everywhere.
A survey carried out in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that of the reasons given by employers for the difficulties they encountered in filling jobs, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Potential job opportunities requiring languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
The fact that he can communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow him to automatically get ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language education now is important for today's children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better chances of finding quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important for the UK in the run-up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools he or she can always choose from a number of languages taught by specialist teachers.
Independent schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this time, it is undeniable that in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as 'competences for international communication'.
Independent schools will continue to offer these choices, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
It must be done well.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait of the fans who have been waiting to see LeBron James make his debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, has announced that James will play in the opening preseason game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself", he said.
Time of Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at locations with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy pending, Trump is aiming to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the appearances this week of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been strained by allegations of sexual misconduct and has been holding up an early Senate confirmation vote for at most a week while the FBI investigates them.
However, the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections gain momentum.
President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week are intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majorities", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we go into the campaign", a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, tonight's rally could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as Pittsburgh media coverage, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"For Morrisey it is not a good sign that the president has to come and give him a push in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows they dare to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles matches.
After three individual sessions, maybe Saturday afternoon foursomes are just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
"We were six points ahead and now we are four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost", commented Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in their sails and plenty of reasons to be excited, including the pair of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
The guttural shouts of celebration rose in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game as he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the game in the 15th was met with a similar shout, one that conveys that he believes the American team is not yet out.
What we need to do is redouble our efforts and concentrate on the match, Spieth said.
That's what these players have done.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players to have more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
Europe's weird, adorable couple is four of a kind and nothing can go wrong.
Moliwood was the only pair not to bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the final nine holes of Friday morning.
That streak and the way his energy flows with the bustling crowd makes it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
It is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson fired Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four balls, after teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn't get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch up close because you appreciate the interactions between the couples, the advice they give and don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the final day, but this foursomes session also showed that the US team dares to fight, something that some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe starts with a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 result over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins over a Tiger Woods who was in trouble, leading four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, overpowered a US team that made many mistakes during the morning's fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. put up more of a fight in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to score four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, their magnificent union served to defeat a dispirited Woods and rookie American Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who hadn't stood out much in the two games on Saturday, had occasional moments of brilliance, but now has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, was again Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three respectively, 2-1.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas served as benchmarks for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They won a thrilling 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spaniard Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the opening two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has only recovered from a four-point gap in singles matches on two occasions, although Furyk, as the holder of the trophy, needs only a draw to retain it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says there is "no chance" they will disarm first unilaterally if they don't have confidence
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country unilaterally giving up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the international body that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States, he said.
If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't have confidence in our national security, and, under those circumstances, there is no chance that we will disarm unilaterally first.
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes incremental steps, his statement is important, as he did not simply reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The US has insisted on denuclearization first and increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even objecting to a declaration of ending the war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a chimera of people who don't know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, announced with much fanfare by the US leader to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the past five months, adding: If South Korea had been the interested party in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in such a stalemate.
Even so, Ri's tone of speech was radically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea's missiles towards US soil after the 'evil president' Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim 'rocket man'.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous move toward disarmament, but said much more needed to be done and sanctions needed to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump claimed there was no set deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its advances.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the UN Security Council on Thursday: The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without default until we make final and fully verified denuclearization a reality.
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea denounced his "demands as those of a mafia man".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had communicated to him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students give a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students are getting more sleep in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of studying all night and drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world's top universities often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she only found out about this now, in her senior year.
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, noted that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were barely sleeping during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Afterwards, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know it's not going to change student behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco", added Professor Czeisler.
He said the culture of "pride of staying up all night" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure students are under meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and good quality sleep should be the students' "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to prevent weight gain, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical biology and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
She noted that the course had opened her eyes and inspired her to expand it to the entire campus.
He hopes the next step will be to require all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider putting on an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted from the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so that they would eventually have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal is the grave of Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of depression away from home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking for their first away win since the 4-1 February win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerrard's for only the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points clear of the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga's attack came seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' uninspired lineup was not up to the task at any point.
Now, Rangers down to sixth, Livingston up to third, behind Hibernian on goal difference.
The Rangers may be in for more trouble, as linebacker Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after someone allegedly threw an object from the visitors' end.
Gerrard changed eight of the starting line-ups that won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt took out the 11 Livingston players who took a point away from Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his highly organised team drowned out the opposition at every turn.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston had better use of the ball when he had it.
They should have scored two minutes into the game, when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman who passed through the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs took a deep foul for captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defence, Alan Lithgow, could only send it out by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed there was more hope than conviction about their game in the final third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson turned a deaf ear to the Colombian's request.
The Rangers got two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly able to cope with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's dull pitch.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a deep stop from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and passed it to Menga to score.
At halftime, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block him.
Still, the Livingston kept leading the visitors to exactly the kind of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing long passes after long passes.
Holt's could have taken more advantage in the closing stages, but McGregor held firm to push Jacobs back before Lithgow completed a no-go corner.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a late penalty after a run-in with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac section: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and counting... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has been a mainstay of science ever since, also became a mainstay of pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado, with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: It's like a radio!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab.
So they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and re-inject it.
A trial of the vaccine is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, commented: 'Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.'
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer", such as breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and 'training' them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump rant wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed at the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for re-election in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the Make America Great Again cap, he began ranting against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often talk to a white person and they ask me how I can like Trump if he's racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have left America a long time ago, he declared.
SNL began the show with a Matt Damon sketch in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's rant to social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
Also, West told the audience that he had a bad time backstage for wearing that hat.
They messed with me.
I was told not to go out with my hat on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and added that he was going to put on his Superman cape, because that meant no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.
His comments were booed by the audience on at least two occasions and the SNL members appeared embarrassed, as reported by Variety. One person told the magazine, "The studio was completely silent".
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West baffled many when he took the stage to sing I Love It dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by TPUSA conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MUSLIM.
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being himself and that's absolutely wonderful".
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes, or supporting their art) who I consider is embracing and spreading an ideology that is dangerous to my community.
He's free to go.
We too", he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, not to mention the late music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.

The defendant is expected to appear in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The D.A.'s office will review the charges.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, is attacking toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such roles on screen often convey to young boys that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he finds it "quite important" to address this issue.
"Personally, I think it's quite important at this point, where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he commented.
What have we been teaching men as they grow up, thinking about the problems that you see now?
Kit believes television may have some responsibility for the increasing toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he went on: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and in the street, that makes young men feel that they have to be this particular form of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it's clear that something has gone wrong in the education of the young.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be participating in any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ends next summer, stating that he is fed up with battlefields and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever taken away from Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so, in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on, he stated.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases than the previous year
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
In the country there are more than 820,000 people affected, according to the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40 000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has practically all decreased, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan Province.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 percent and 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican senators and claims that it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that those accusations were being driven by "far-right" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies", Waters commented in a Twitter post.
The leaked information allegedly included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person on Capitol Hill posted the information online during a Senate panel session regarding the allegations of sexual misconduct made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the posts was associated with Waters' office and made public the details of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not at all responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters' statement prompted immediate criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
'He angrily denies this information,' Fleischer wrote.
This suggests you don't have the temperance necessary to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He must not rebel.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
You must remain calm and composed.
It appears Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is seeking to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If true, it is very serious", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations".
'We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered,' he continued, 'and that they are held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all my staff members.'
Johnny English review: Back in action, the spy parody of Rowan Atkinson is short
It has now become a tradition to look for Brexit nods in any new film with a British focus. It seems that this is the appropriate thing to do with this new installment of the parody action-comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satire about how clearly insane we are the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has renewed his license to screw up for a second time, and his name alone hints that, more than anything, this is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, it's the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of lavish glamour, has a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a dash of that guy who played a single note on the Chariots of Fire theme that was played at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, it was originally based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard television ads, sowing chaos behind him.
In this latest installment, there are one or two good moments.
I loved watching Johnny English approach a helicopter in medieval armor as the propellers crashed into the hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is rather short-lived and strangely superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie franchises like 007 and Mission: Impossible add comic ingredients seamlessly.
The humor seems more directed at children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's absurd misadventures are not as witty and apt as Atkinson's silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the dismay of the agent in charge, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final straw for the prime minister, a pompous, cornered character who is seeing her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn't leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, since all active spies are in danger, he will have to resort to one who is retired.
That's got to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a seedy school, although he gives off-the-record lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, since this is a spy academy like the School of Rock.
English is flown to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his long-suffering old sidekick Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not sufficiently tapped.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, with the beautiful female fatality Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding in Volta's luxurious yacht; moreover, English becomes pure anarchy when he attempts to use a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
They were definitely used to the full in that last sequence, but as funny and as loud as it is, the whole thing still has a somewhat childish feel to it.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do true justice to her talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they are paid five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan whereby the British would work four days a week, but get paid five.
The party allegedly wants company owners to allocate the savings gained from the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
Sources say the idea "would fit" into the party's plans and economic agenda to tilt the country in favor of workers.
This change to a four-day week has received support from the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A review of the directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't be achieved overnight, but the four-day work week is definitely an issue the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in the worker's favor, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party would not be the first to back such ideas, as the Green Party already promised a four-day work week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, not all Labour supporters are in favour of this decision at the moment.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and is not going to be discussed at this time".
Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to lay out his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was prepared to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "exploiters" in charge of companies providing public services.
The shadow minister's plans also include the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies will not get their full stake back, as a Labour government could apply deductions that would match the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of the shares of private sector companies would be allocated to employees, which would mean annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds.
The FBI's ongoing investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice by at least a week and raises the question of whether the results could influence any Republican senators to finally withdraw their support.
In an interview to be aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could leak information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Sure, of course", said Kennedy.
"I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, after the allegation came out, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, resolute, sharp".
Graham's vote, however, seems unshakable.
"I have already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and would dismiss the charge", he said.
"Ms. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it", Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she names have been able to confirm it.
Thirty-six years ago.
It's always the same, I don't see anything new in this case".
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Has it succeeded in reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival where an impressive lineup of stars come together in support of an equally impressive mission: ending world poverty.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concertgoers have had to complete a series of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved in 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action, or is it just a form of what's called "clictivism", which is the attitude we take when we think we're doing something really helpful by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded over 19 million "actions" by its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Through these actions, they claim to have gotten world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth over $37 billion, which will impact the lives of over 2,25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that arose from its actions, of which, at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", an association of UK-based investors and executives united by a common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential".To this end, they have proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving over 4700 tweets from Global Citizens contributors.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens contributors like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during an April 2018 concert in London.
The group also claimed that, after having carried out more than 5000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we think can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen contributor responded: "It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But as the movements for human rights and against apartheid have done before, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are just some of the acts that will be performing at this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to carry out blockade on Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary", Washington could use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, revealed U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as reported in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, just as they are with Eastern Europe, becoming the supplier farthest south of Europe", he said.
Moreover, according to official information, there are ways and methods of dealing with this issue.
"The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up in the market", he said.
Zinke addressed people attending an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels", he warned, indicating that Russia knows only one thing to do, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims come as the Trump administration has been trying to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and relieve Russia of that role, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do this, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is worth $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic considerations and is yet another example of unfair competition.
"I think we all share the idea that energy cannot be turned into a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, last September in Moscow.
The US position has, however, been rejected by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During an appearance at the Holyoke, Massachusetts City Hall, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and finally have women in leadership", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president".
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during an appearance at City Hall and claimed that "he was leading the country down the wrong path".
"I'm really concerned about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote".
A poll was released Thursday, but a majority of Warren's own voters don't believe he should run for re-election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "possible" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
However, 32 per cent of those polled supported his candidacy.
The poll showed a higher support for the previous governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidacy for 2020 of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin speaks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a rally by Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"The situation my son is going through, everything that has happened since he came back, is well known to other families who suffer from the effects of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers come back with", he told the crowd who gathered at a pro-Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the big taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented on her son and other war veterans who "come back with a different, hardened demeanor, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all the other members of the military, have given to their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of one episode of domestic violence toward a woman, which interferes with a domestic violence complaint and possession of weapons under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to get a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district presented a "friendly" letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker who is standing up to the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the "Grace v. Sessions" case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy has not been released.
She said her partner "and their children, who are members of a violent gang", abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum requests to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum in the United States.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine issued a statement Friday asserting that the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law".
"Under federal law, all asylum claims must be dismissed on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this exception violates that principle", the amicus curiae brief states.
The lawyers also said in the brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by claiming that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and "suppose a necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"People who leave their home countries because of persecution or threats on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership of a social group or particular political opinion can apply for asylum", Sessions said when announcing the directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death tolls rise in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more dire.
"The situation is very tense", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her baby with a fever in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Ambulances are arriving with more bodies every minute.
And clean water is scarce".
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to rummage through the few drowned belongings they have left in an effort to recover what they can.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, also damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the injured; among them, Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside the building due to the continuous aftershocks, also very strong.
He couldn't help but cry as he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while he was on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to get to safety.
I got caught in the debris of the collapsed wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press.
"I heard my wife cry for help and then a terrible silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're all right".
US ambassador accuses China of bullying with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily pay supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to meddle in the US congressional elections on November 6, something China flatly denies.
Trump's accusation of Beijing's attempt to influence the US election marked what US officials told Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign initiated by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to run ads to promote their business activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels on imports by both sides.
China's countervailing tariffs that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were designed to fall on exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, which is one of the top exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, China "is further intensifying that pressure with advertisements in our free press".
"In trying to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of free speech and a free press by attempting to run a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, you only see a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that people in China may have about the worrying trajectory their country's economy is taking, as the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party's firm pressure", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers evaded the offer to publish" his article, though he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women ahead of the midterm vote with the Kavanaugh debacle.
With many leading Republicans closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over the various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that there may be a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this event have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed their desire to go ahead with the vote.
"In these kinds of matters it's not possible to back down", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Sen. Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) latest attempt to take a stand in favor of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters upset about the issue.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters gathered at the Senate gates chanting "November is coming!" as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is off the charts", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People say that the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even higher, especially among the undecided women of the suburbs and the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who don't usually vote even if they don't like the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his sexual abuse allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts indicated that a setback could ensue if Republicans move forward with confirmation.
"This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, as reported by NBC News.
"It's not just a question of committee voting or the final vote, or even whether they're going to seat Kavanaugh; it's also about how the Republicans have handled all of this and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helps elect Democrats), told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they don't know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, though a few more are siding with the latter.
A new YouGov poll indicates that 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony is definite or probable, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh's testimony is definite or probable.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had either likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same of Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as, at least, those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez, for his part, alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when he was a student at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project from the tech legend, a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "take over the world".
"It has to be now", he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own "personal data online store" or a POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
One thing that is unique about personal online data storage is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the on-staff developers who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a radical change where all their business models are completely modified overnight.
"We're not going to ask permission".
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote of Inrupt that "its mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite even being launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann - the clergyman who won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the VC on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said that it was "of special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the decoration.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through thick fog and under heavy machine-gun and cannon fire".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with "greatest courage", advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and shooting down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "so great that I could never measure up to him, but they were very instructive".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which featured the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is evident when he is shown such a large support".
MMA fans stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch the entire Bellator 206 so that you're not allowed to watch the main event.
The San Jose card featured 13 fights, six included on the main card, and in the United Kingdom it was to be broadcast live in the evening on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to watch the fight.
One Twitter follower described the switch to cartoons as "a heavy joke".
"There's a government regulation that regulates content that airs after 6 a.m. and this one wasn't appropriate, so they had to switch to kids programming", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yeah".
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will be modifying the show to include British viewers in upcoming editions.
"When I think about the option of relay, I think it can work", Coker said.
"But it's 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're looking into it.
Believe me, when the schedule was changed, there were a lot of messages and not all of them were kind, exactly.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise that next time it won't happen.
We're gonna cut it down to five fights instead of six, which is what we normally do, and we're gonna try to offer more than the usual so that the fans are happy and we're gonna go overboard.
It is a very unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, though this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At 24, she told us that it wasn't until she was in high school that she realized that "not everyone was like me".
On Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs programme, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in speaking out for gay rights was to transmit "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to downplay the fact that he won the Olympics.
The regular host of this mythical show, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for a few months due to illness.
On Laverne's first show, Daley, who portrayed himself as an outcast, commented that he felt "inferior" to others during his childhood, because "it wasn't socially accepted that you like boys and girls".
She said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he claimed, so he was not disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year's Commonwealth Games held in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass that "hope" on to other people.
The three-time world champion stated that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year to the Oscar winner, who has been married to her for 20 years, though she specified that the age difference had never been an issue.
"When you live so long from so young" (he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who has been through the same ups and downs as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all the answers would have been 'I have to win a gold medal'", he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is definitely Robbie".
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that I couldn't be in the front row", she said.
"I had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it was not until that very moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew then that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to compete in the pool in front of my family at the Olympic Games, there was nothing better", she said.
This was also the inspiration for her first song, Heather Small's Proud, which she sang during the Olympic preparation phase.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in poor form, was benched in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid it becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who was playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he has so often done for the United States, the five-time major champion had to settle for cheering at times and, at others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus rectify what afflicted him.
Never the most direct of drivers, even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough punishes continuously with wrong shots.
And, if the field isn't already daunting enough, Mickelson, in game nine on Sunday, faces the brilliant British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches they've played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points down at the start of the 12 individual matches, started in an impressive way, Mickelson's match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, he couldn't say much more either.
"He understood perfectly the role I had today, he slapped me on the back and, wrapping his arm around me, said that he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's done a lot for these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I thought it would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of them".
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It could be the last in a whole career of Ryder Cups that had never so clearly matched the levels of his individual mark.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, though Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make fun of others; it's great to have him on the team", she explained.
"I think the younger players loved having him as a support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings so much more than just play".
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows full well that even if you come in with a substantial lead in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end only managed to finish off the others by stepping on their heels by a minimal margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop to remind yourself that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we did it in Brookline and lost, we did it in Valderrama and won, but by a very small margin", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead it 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and the rest of the world that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This isn't over until the dots are on the marker.
We have one goal to accomplish, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to think about.
I say this all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no more and no less, than the best players in the world".
Proud of what his players have done on a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are the individual performances and this is different.
It's great to share what's going on with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, it really tests your golf skills.
That's the message we need to get across to the players, to bring out the best in ourselves tomorrow.
Now it's time to put your partner aside, go and bring out the best in yourself".
Against Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as a pair, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big tournaments in the last few days and has been part of the team that won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe performed the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word", he said when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
"We have 12 super-important games tomorrow, "but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and we let them go with the feeling that we were going to try and do something magical tomorrow".
We assign Thomas the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the roster.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole course", Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The German Navy's new frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships from the Cold War era, but it won't be until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman quoted by the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery derailed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
We know they will include a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared and very low acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays have meant that the innovative ships - which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas - will be outdated by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half the personnel of the former Bremen-class frigates.
The vessel was also found to be overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), instead of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy is "running out of ships capable of deployment".
The officer said the problem has worsened over time, because the old ships were decommissioned but not replaced with new ones.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state in the Scottish Highlands, tries to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that all that is learned will shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano bats as well as Daubenton's river bats and long-eared browns from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected from the recordings to find out how often the bats call and which species do.
A report and a habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of grasslands and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development affecting their nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind,
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in getting their target.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections, and occasionally rescues.
The organisation has even opened Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Threave area of Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats", he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still a lot that is unknown about bats, so the work we are doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive".
It emphasises the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance work on the property, as a breeding colony can be destroyed involuntarily and 400 females and young may be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species about which we don't know how their populations evolve".
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations "fake news", and says people "want to be known" at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying him $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already amassed 142 million followers just hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, branded the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just trying to help.
What they said today is false", says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner looking into the camera.
"They just want publicity at the expense of my name.
It's the same old story.
They want to make a name for themselves by just mentioning me, but it's like that, I can't help it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations that appear in what they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the area of privacy", Reuters reports.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will try to get compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the alleged incident took place in June of 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was a "99 percent" "good guy" and that he had let him down that remaining "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she had "fear of reprisals" and was worried about "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman claims she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the events.
When the alleged attack occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has switched to Juve, a big name in Italian football for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of its life" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Industry Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily halted.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of customs delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stoppages at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general manager in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal, particularly in relation to cross-border trade; these include Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns raised by car manufacturers are related to problems that could arise on assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is based on the 'just in time' production mode, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to build cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a disruption at the border which, according to the industry, could cause delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to accommodate the amount of material equivalent to more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in that case production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan, which sets out future relations with the EU, is "precisely calibrated to avoid such checks at border crossings".
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get off the ground right now but we have to seize the opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue what, up to now, has been a tremendously successful set of supply chains".
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they are never recovered".
A government spokesman said: 'We have put in place a precise and convincing plan outlining our future relations with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed for another week", as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump and Russian aid, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The anticipation of whether Trump will decide to fire the deputy attorney general and thus compromise Mueller's independence has fueled gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded conversations with Trump with a microphone he himself wore to try to relegate the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was at the time at the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, though this would delay the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said, "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering everything that's going on with the Supreme Court.
We'll decide on the march and I'll go inform the press, as I usually do".
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held any press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked what the motives were.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting with grandiloquence, though he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they brag".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him", he said, while quoting without evidence: "We've cross-checked those numbers".
Press conferences will continue to be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking the president of the United States directly, I think it's a hell of a lot better than asking me.
We've tried to do it many times and you've seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him only happen on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week in New York, the president demonstrated why that was so, where he made a lighthearted and sometimes bizarre appearance to the reporters who were gathered there.
Health Secretary writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their Brexit fears
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working in HHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and its wish that they remain with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK is due to withdraw from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in the non-central public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: 'During the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal followed, in which the decisions expected this autumn were chosen.
However, the UK Government has also stepped up preparations around a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be very confusing for you.
And it is for this very reason that I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is without a doubt your home and we would love to continue to count on you".
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed informed reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the band and collapsed right there", Reed said.
Both the coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie at the band line before placing him on a gurney and taking him for an in-depth examination.
A Tennessee State staff member told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury yet or the damage done" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, bringing his total to 18 for the season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher estate transfer tax when buying property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a top estate transfer tax when they buy property in the UK and the extra money raised from this measure will be used to shelter the 'homeless', according to the Conservatives' new plans.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters.
The increase in estate transfer tax will be imposed on those who are not paying UK tax
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to go to the homeless.
The extra money raised by the increase in the estate transfer tax for foreign buyers of UK property will go towards helping the 'homeless', Theresa May announced today.
The move is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and harass those with higher incomes.
The increase in the estate transfer tax will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to incentivise government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transfer tax, including also the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the buy-to-let system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year from this change.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which causes prices to rise and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the wealthiest areas of the country (especially the capital) have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large builders of keeping property prices too high by greedily buying up land with no intention of using it and urged Mrs May to remove quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's 'shameful housing problem'.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unjustified evictions.
It also proposes giving local authorities more powers to build new housing.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my office as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that involves fixing the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that non-UK residents and foreign companies can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a house has become too difficult for many people to achieve and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real".
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland manager says his "primary objective" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the prospect of revitalizing the north-east club, which is currently third in League One, three points behind the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap", Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it's something that has always made me want to go back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a successful club".
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when he moved to such established names at such a big club, after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this moment, success for me is measured by whether I can get this club back to the Premier League,
'The club is a very successful club in the Premier League, because the structure and facilities of this club correspond, without a doubt, to those of the Premier League,' he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I can only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it belongs".
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a spell as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third division and took St. Mirren from being on the verge of relegation to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalled, referring to when he took over the Alloa.
"I always thought that directing was my best skill, much more than acting.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I could make a very good living from it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to deal with a lot of stuff every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I've managed to do it, it's the time of my adult life when I've felt the best, without a doubt".

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted profits in struggling British pubs, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant profits fell by 4.8 per cent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consultancy, which compiled the figures, commented: "The heat of the day and the fact that England are still in the World Cup have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June, in which pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, while restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly serve drinks had their strongest month, versus most restaurants, where profits were down.
Pubs that mainly serve meals also suffered from the heat, though not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the bars and pubs managed, beverage sales rose by up to 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM's hospitality and leisure analysts said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups are still struggling, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful in view of the continuing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide the relief they need.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in branded establishments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents' backs
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers' backs, a survey reveals
The survey, conducted among 20,000 high school students, revealed a rise in fake Instagram pages
News has heightened fears of sexual content being posted
20% of students claimed to have a "main" account that they show to their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) create accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced in fake accounts on Instagram, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has heightened fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of pupils claimed to have a healthy "main" account showing their parents, while having other private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site saw a teenager encouraging others to "rape" her.
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, stated: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and its chairman, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having her on their board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I like being the spokesperson for the athletes and I hope I can bring things and help develop the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta among his four golds and is now a regular pundit on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He tweeted: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine whether or to what extent I would recover.
It's been exhausting, but I've made a full recovery, I had to learn to walk again and I'm currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and encouraging words!"
Advertisement of the sacaleches comparing mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A company that produces milk from a cow has divided the Internet public opinion with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is theoretically the "world's first silent milk pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a somewhat tongue-in-cheek music video showing mothers telling of the freedom the new milk pump gives them.
Four real women dance on a haystack as a dance floor, along with cows, with words like, "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts".
The chorus goes on to say, "Sort them, sort them, I'm feeding their babies, sort them, sort them, I'm milking my women".
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has created a huge controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it succeeds in bringing the "horrors" of the dairy sector into focus.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away days after they give birth", wrote one person.
The Elvie milk pump is discreetly fitted into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Tragic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a crazy ad".
However, others defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "disparaging" to her.
I think it's a great idea.
If I could still suckle, I'm sure I'd have one.
Using the pump, I felt like a total cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I'm not going to dwell on it.
It's a brilliant product, a woman told us.
Another person commented: "It's a funny ad targeted at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The advertisement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and is discreetly attached inside the breastfeeding bra, allowing its users to move around, hold their babies and even go outside with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, comments: The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while also demonstrating in a fun and up-close way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump offers.
This isn't the first time the Elvie bomb has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in detention has seen a considerable increase, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has remained at virtually flat levels, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to take in a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult family members would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a top official at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
About 80% of sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people", Albence said.
In their effort to process minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month of detention, instead of the previous 60 days, according to reception center workers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed eligible for protection will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reception centre workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Advocates say these concerns are even greater in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where the signs of illness in these children are more likely to be overlooked because of their size.
Furthermore, being moved to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish 'occupation forces' to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country's war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly".
'They must withdraw immediately and without conditions', he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is practically over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting this holy battle until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the right conditions were being created for them to return and blamed some Western countries for sowing irrational fears that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns, he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had "clear timelines" and expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted to "reviewing articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, an impeachment or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would be without a doubt the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!
At this time, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for the top nightly news programs.
"It's a strange attraction that we don't yet understand", says Neal Baer, writer-producer of "Designated Survivor", an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 election.
The cab driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because it makes me laugh", was the response Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike anything else you see on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility that immigrant families can be reunited, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information is off limits when you realize that you've been watching for six hours a panel of experts debating the use of the "deep background" fonts used by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin hunter (a "garment of unbridled pride", in The Washington Post's words) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's grim descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Offering something new every night is part of what makes it feel like a reality show", says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", as he talks about Trump's show's rotating cast and his daily plot twists (either getting into a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to be left behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny day on the north shore of Kauai, but he was sheltered inside watching MSNBC while CNN was taping.
He couldn't get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people told us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.

Foreign money flows into tighter midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It's no surprise the influx of money is pouring into Pennsylvania's 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election to the same seat.
This Pittsburgh residential district, whose structure was recently redesigned, has Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, a district that overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a campaign finance feud between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits have given the Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, though it later backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent "decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of around US$140 million in 2017 for, among other matters, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was for the conference to go ahead, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, diplomats say, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has attached to the meeting.
The three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new threats or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step planned could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence on the public record.
Mueller is also thought to be leading this investigation into the possibility that the Trump campaign worked in parallel with Russia in their attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will find himself accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to once again appear before voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionality, and by that I don't suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or slowed.
Americans are now facing several of these tipping points.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good place since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his unfitness for office.
Rosenstein says the Times' explanation is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new investigation the FBI has requested into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
On top of all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these exams, we will face a long winter for democracy.
But thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we won't fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic ahead of the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to bigger things.
"We managed to get a good point, as Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game thinking we could get something and we came away with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but, in general, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went all out and were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get the three points, but it will be a difficult game because they already got a good result in the previous game. But, with all the audience supporting us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a general feeling that everything will be fine.
The team is doing well, the guys are having a lot of fun and we're having a good practice.
I'm hopeful that we can move on, put last season behind us and achieve success.
Fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people discuss this with their families.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this subject.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they're not taking the steps to have this conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children. You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as these options can be a determining factor in cost.
Incorporate your financial advisor into the conversion, as he can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-based hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses, or insuring yourself with your own savings, provided you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents - get ahead of the legal battles.
Get a healthcare power of attorney to appoint a trusted person to supervise your healthcare and to make sure that the professionals comply with your own wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You can also prepare a power of attorney for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always ready.
It's not just the finances that are at stake: which doctors to deal with? asks Martin.
What medications are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
You have to have everything planned.
A man is shot several times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a rifle as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 (UK time), as a random act.
The victim didn't see her attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have issued a call for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said.
With communications blocked, aid officials have been unable to get any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, a zone of high seismic activity, and earthquakes are common.
Here is a summary of some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake devastated southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coastline, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami was remembered.
This time it didn't cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the death of over 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, had a series of large earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily displaced thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin has been ordered remanded to Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself definitively innocent when asked for his statement, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he punched her in the face.
Several veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks have been down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just off the center of Sulawesi, which is northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are exceptionally seeking the death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental Home Depot van to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan last October, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed all eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent for the death penalty application, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder with the aid of organized crime, which federal prosecutors typically use in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "cowardly, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, is specified in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a New York federal case was Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This couple was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant originally from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told investigators he felt good about what he'd done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out his attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be hoisted in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea with a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all the people involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians needed to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should take charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "gone out" if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Prime Minister May faces to reconcile her divided ranks has been further highlighted as a group of pro-Remain Tories have joined an opposing anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep the compromise plan signed at Chequers on track amid attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that he would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlash, and force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between his package and "chaos".
MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position of responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left by now", he said.
This Wellingborough MP added: 'I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.'
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the European Union is completely false".
Pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: "I'll just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public doesn't like Chequers' plan, the opposition isn't going to vote for it and it's not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: 'Prime Ministers keep their posts when they keep their promises.'
Farage told the gatherers that politicians should be made to "feel the heat" if they were seen to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class, he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We will mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the pro-Remainers roamed the streets of Birmingham ahead of the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group's presentation this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security issues they had with a party app during the conference opening.
"These are the same people who are telling us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borders in harmony, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
It's a total sham.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit", she added.
Warren is considering all possibilities for running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all possibilities of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An aide asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes having a woman at the top".
One arrested for the shooting death of LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and got shot by Simpson.
During questioning, Simpson admitted to being at the crime scene, in possession of a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-5 Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team orders would play a big role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got off to a good start and nearly threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to pit and let Hamilton run in the tail of the pack, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out strongly a lap later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after an almost-stuck wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior free at the risk of resisting after a double move to defend into the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race while holding on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth position.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen regained fourth position.
It's been a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect match", said Hamilton.
That was some really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony offered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are "bad, disgusting and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last days in the Senate, is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false", he said.
When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say "But I didn't do it.
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't leak it.
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked it", he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential, so I did.
But his refusal didn't seem to sit well with the president, who during the Saturday night rally commented as follows: "I'll tell you one thing: that was really bad body language".
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, the president said as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss on Friday in the Elite League to the Belfast Giants by winning the return leg on Saturday 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants got a two-goal lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the home run before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
This has been the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively opening period, Sullivan again put the home team in the mood to play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to equalise the match at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again tied the game with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match as the second half came to an end and secured the victory with his team's fifth goal as the final drew near.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape in the plane from the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died after ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many are trapped in the rubble in Palu city.
Despite his fellow passengers fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, which was being hit by a strong sway.
He stood firm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the tarmac at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We had arranged for a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
'Our hearts are broken to hear this,' he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand people, with the national disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of victims is expected to continue to rise, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and many people could not be contacted", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial planes.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is trying its best to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there
This is a tragedy in itself, but it could have been a lot worse.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?, reported CNN.
Indonesia was already hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after plane crashes in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says one man is missing, after saying all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon it could not be aware of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overtaken the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in too low.
"That's an extremely good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes says that he and other passengers managed to make their way through waist-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors doing nearby dock improvement work also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to ferry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation safety network data indicates that 111 people have died in accidents involving Papua New Guinea-registered airlines in the past two decades, but none involving Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution wrapped up its arguments Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to trace the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, thus contradicting her previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my van was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records indicate that they met only a week before.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York nanny sues couple for firing her after 'racist' text
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denies that it is racist and compares the lawsuit to a case of extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay at discovering that the new childcare worker, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing his blunder, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his previous African-American nanny had done a lousy job and was instead expecting a Filipina, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got his day's pay and sent it home in an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for severance pay with the intent of receiving $350 a day compensation for the six-month in-house work position for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not the way things are done", he told The Post on Friday, adding that "I know it's a case of discrimination".
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the most reasonable thing to do, as they feared they could not trust her after having offended her.
My wife had sent him something he didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on now!
Likening the lawsuit to "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
You're going after someone like that?
That's not a very decent thing", the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers might not identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It was hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before its publication.
It's very funny to know now what we know about Paddington's great success.
After saying that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a teddy bear to write the children's book, was confident that his work would be rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was something of a "bitter sweet" after his passing last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", added that her father was very proud of her ultimate success.
"He was a very quiet man and did not like to show off", he said.
But because Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost like having a son who accomplishes something important: you're proud of him, even if it's not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
'Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he was not expected to make it,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were slowly being used up and leaving his system.
She had died prematurely and everything was shutting down.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't howl, or scream, or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on tight.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, oblivious to the terrible experience she was going through.
"Nobody knew", he said.
I lowered my head and tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.
Women in mourning put up suicide prevention cards is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day", he said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that his son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said her smile lit up the place.
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after he took his own life.
Mrs Davis said: 'I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions.'
Davis created the cards so that people would know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to speak it.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was depressed or anything like that", he said.
A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they have to overcome it: "It leaves a void in the whole family.
It's left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a limited-time, limited-reach investigation), maybe we could bring some unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "going to pieces" amid a partisan gridlock.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to go forward?
His refusal is entirely due to the timeline.
With just five weeks to go until the November 6 midterm elections, if, as expected, the Republicans have a poor showing, their attempts to get the man they want elected to the nation's highest court will be severely undermined.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House.
What happens once the FBI releases their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean defector figures fall with Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and high fees charged by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and they are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed in broad terms to work towards a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
Without the trust of the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under these circumstances, we will by no means be the first to disarm unilaterally, Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysterical" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
At the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi made her objections when asked if she would impeach Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed to the position and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say one thing: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won't be fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, you won't even be fit to be on the court that you're on now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible sentences against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she is considered to be a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for some hysterical, unbiased person to go to court and expect us to think everything is fine", Pelosi said.
And women have to hold it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of rage pouring out, and she can't let it go without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's that weird, do you?
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive in a company and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to: "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
No, I'm not mad.
And then he'd go on with whatever he was doing.
I thought it was great.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for rage in part because they're basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage when an older woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the buttocks and dragged me up a flight of stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry", he said.
They have no idea you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they've cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential runs.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business that forced her to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came to the realization that there was no reason not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-considered decision", he told me laughingly 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the campaign was already well underway, he fell behind in fundraising, so he promised himself that he would not enter the race again unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, only gave her $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not be running a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made fundraising difficult and focused on recruiting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism) that she choked.
'The logical thing would have been to think that he had had a nervous breakdown,' Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my headstone?
Did she cry?
The US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvoes in the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a break between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year by putting tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) in goods, taxing half of the goods entering the US from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has retaliated in kind, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US products worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to match the attacks of the US, and it is unlikely that the world's second most powerful economy will slacken anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down would mean giving in to demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressures of the US trade war could positively help China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a crash in either country's economy is actually far more dangerous than bystanders have acknowledged so far", said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asian issues for the strategic cabinet Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions were improving.
'The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism', he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country and in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States now has six straight defeats on European soil since the last time they won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight through most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water on the 16th hole, par 3, thus admitting defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever achieve a 5-0-0 record since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5-4 by the lowest ranked player in the European team, the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran who has won eight Ryder Cups, became the European player with the most tournament wins of all time, with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very tough year.
I'm totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy that I was able to get the cup back.
It is an achievement of the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help", said an excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He now passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, as I grew up watching this man", said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
That's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to struggle all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we blew it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Your 12 players have played a very good game.
We regroup, I'll meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 boys very much and I'm proud to be their captain.
Now we have to bow our heads.
They've outrun us.
