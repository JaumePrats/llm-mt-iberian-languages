This discovery confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has already been widely accepted, but it offers details that fossils usually cannot offer, such as the color and three-dimensional arrangement of the feathers.
The plumage of this bird was brownish-castaneous on the upper part with a darker brownish-carotenoid background.
The finding also offers a glimpse of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a well-developed cannon called a rachis, but they do have other characteristics of the feathers barbs and barbules.

He is under custody pending trial, but any witness video could be rejected because his image has been published everywhere.
This is a common practice in any other part of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts have seen the publication of photographs as potentially harmful.
The professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects".
The office of the Crown, which is responsible for the accusations, has indicated that it will not make any more statements, at least, until the verdict.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to establish according to the borders before the Middle East war of 1967.
Among the other issues discussed, according to reports, is the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Valley of Jordan.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees to accept it for five years.
The hunters in the pilot test of supplementary pest control had to be closely monitored by forest guards, as the pilot test was monitored and evaluated.
In an association of NPWS and the Association of Sporting Shooters of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified skilled volunteers were recruited under the Association of Sporting Shooters' Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Interim Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received appropriate training and safety training.
Yesterday Martelly took oath to a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) of nine members.
It is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
The past month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Electoral Provisional Council, in the framework of a package of measures aimed at advancing the country toward new elections.
The commission was the response of Martelly to the generalized protests against the regime that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of holding elections, some of which had been scheduled for 2011.
There have been 60 reported cases of iPod malfunction and overheating, causing six fires and injuring four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
The week before, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
In response, the ministry accused Apple of "frankly disingenuous" delaying the report.
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 AM local time (09:19 PM GMT Friday).
The office of emergency management of the Northern Mariana Islands has said no damage has been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that no signal of a tsunami had been received.
A former Philippine police officer has kept as hostages tourists from Hong Kong for a bus hijacking in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Six hostages have been rescued and at least six people have been confirmed to have died.
A few weeks ago, six hostages, including children and the elderly, have been freed, including Filipino photographers.
The photographers then occupied the place of an elderly lady, who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He became a gynaecologist and started working at the Auckland Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births during his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal development of the baby.
Xinhua has reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes.
Compañeros luchadores también han rendido homenaje a Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died the night of two full moons. A strong woman, like Luna.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels has commented that "Luna was so freaky as I was...maybe even more so...I love her and I'll find her an altar...I hope she finds a better place to be.
Of the 1.400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% from 2008.
The first interim prime minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
The 34% of respondents want the Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme end of the survey, 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The winner of the gold medal at the Olympic Games had to swim the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and to swim three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical form has been questioned due to his complaints.
He has not been able to take the medicines he needs because they are banned in the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date.
A lot of people verified the discovery by using different hardware and software in early February and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water sent to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and keep life going.
Scientists expect to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, began his governorship in January and signed a law last month to legalize the marriage of same-sex couples.
He denounced the rumors of "political chatter" and nonsense.
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Using technology based on satellites differs from the old technology based on land-based radars because controllers can precisely locate pilots with greater accuracy and send them with more accurate information.
None of the trains will stop at Wembley.
The worry of a lack of transportation has led to the possibility that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without the fans of the team.
A study published Thursday in Science described the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galápagos Islands.
Scientists from Princeton University and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species of Darwin's finch has evolved in only two generations, despite the belief that it would take a lot of time for this process to occur.
Gold can be worked in all kinds of shapes. It can be molded into all sorts of shapes.
It can be inserted into very thin threads, which can be twisted.
It can be made very fine and layered over other metals. It can be so fine that it can be used to decorate images painted by hand in books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a substance. You can make a pH indicator by using the juice of a cabbage leaf.
Carrot juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions in the substance being analyzed.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which the electrons have been removed.
Mix the two dusty powders together and then, with clean hands, make a ball.
The humidity of your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing a strange feeling and forming a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Clean sewer pipes have been found in the cities of the Minoan civilization in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China.
When you call somebody who is miles away from you, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space sends out a signal and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. The scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and our sight.
A huge rocket is needed to lift a 100-foot-tall satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredibly amazing way.

Catalan: 
He has brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation means.
Below them there are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felids (including domestic cats) that eat the small prey that is far more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, birds, and even small mammals.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with the other cats.
Lions are the most social felids and live in large groups called bandades.
The herds are made up of one to three males and up to thirty females and their cubs.
Sisters and daughters are closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Leopard bands behave much like wolf packs or dog packs, which are animals with a remarkably similar behaviour to that of lions.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (even though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and push with 5 times the strength of a human strongman.
The tiger is of the same group (cat genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger doesn't sound like the roar of the lion, but rather sounds like the roar of angry words.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. If they can, they will eat mice, small birds, snakes, rodents, and other small animals.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and catch prey (predators) with their sense of smell.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can move very quietly. 

Catalan: 
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main group and original (for example, crossing a mountain or a river, or emigrating to a new island and not being able to return) often they will find themselves in a different environment from that they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need to have different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
The indigenous population has not changed much, they still need the same adaptations that they had before.
With time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new surroundings, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
Species formation is the formation of new species.
Plants manufacture the oxygen that humans breathe and take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also shade.
We build our houses with plants and we make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat is plants. Without plants, most animals couldn't survive.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator of its time, reason why it had no fear of anything, except for other mosasaures.
His long jaws had seventy-seven sharp teeth like knives, with an additional set of teeth in the sky of his mouth, so that there was no way of escaping anything that was in his way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a bifurcated language.
He attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could not compete with him.
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had a few rare or unusual foods at their feasts; such as deer, pheasants, rats, and lemmings.
Another difference between the rich and poor was that, while the poor and women ate in a chair, the rich liked to participate in banquets where they all sat together and ate.
The ancient Roman meals would not have included foods that have come to Europe from the Americas or Asia in centuries later.
So for example, they did not have maize, tomatoes, potatoes, peas, or chicken, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a chicken.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a temple, which was considered the house of the god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to cover the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes pyramids were built in the shape of towers, called ziggurats, as part of temples.
The summit of the tower was a special shrine for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not as important.
The majority of Jewish life was spent in the open air.
The women cooked in the patio; the shops were simple open stalls that looked out onto the street. Stone was used to construct houses.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The sagas say that Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland because of an assassination and, on his journey westward, he discovered Greenland and gave it its name.
There were already indigenous peoples living in the area when the Spaniards arrived.
Although all were Scandinavian countries, there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may have imagined that behind the Declaration of Independence there is a map of a treasure.
There is no such thing as a map of the treasure.
Written behind the Declaration of Independence were the words "Declaration of Independence original with date 4 July 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document, down.
Although no one knows with certainty who wrote it, it is known that the long scroll (29¾ polzades per 24½ polzades) was rolled up to store it.
It seems that the notation was added simply as a tag.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south of France still wasn't free.
It was governed by the France "de Vichy". It was governed by French who had signed the peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders rather than oppose them.
The allies invaded the south of France on 15 August 1940, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen, and civitas, with the meaning of city or city-state, and that also defines somewhat the dimensions of the society.
The city-states preceded nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge through many generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a fair and equitable sharing of knowledge.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any historical traces and are not recognized as civilizations properly so.
During the War of Independence, the Thirteen Colonies first formed a weak central governmentthe Congress being its only componentunder the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as there was no executive or judicial national power, it fell on the state officials to enforce all of its acts.
There was no authority to invalidate taxation laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles needed unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended and the states often absentee themselves.
The Italy national football team, with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swimming, ice hockey, cycling, cycling, auto racing and Formula One are the most popular sports in the country.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and there is a presence of Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, we often call it, in geographical terms, an "archipelago".
Taiwan's origins stretch back to the 15th century, when Portuguese sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
The Dutch East India Company established a base in Taiwan's south-east in 1624, where it initiated the transformation of indigenous agricultural practices and relied on Chinese workers for the plantations of rice and sugar.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) takes control of the western and northern coasts of Taiwan, and declares Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
The year 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which Taiwan is ceded to Japan, which will govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Hall of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how the buildings looked originally.
The restoration of Machu Picchu was completed in 1976, and the restoration continues today.
For example, the most common film format in the world is 35mm, which was the primary film format in the analog era of filmmaking.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited in the formats of digital cameras' image sensors.
The 35 mm format creates, in fact, a little confusion, with 36 mm of width and 24 mm of height.
The aspect ratio of this format is, therefore, 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats, for example) are very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been too often used and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time maintains order in an image.
The most effective place for the subject to be placed is in the intersection between the lines that divide the image into three vertical and horizontal sections (see the example).
During this period the history of Europe was challenged by the Protestant Reformation, which had become rich and powerful.
Christianity has united European states for more than a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the principal principles of Christianity is that the riches should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church funds exist precisely for this reason.
The authority of the Catholic Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money had caused many people to ask if it was being fulfilled.
After the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy was effective, cutting off the vital supplies of military and civilian personnel, but this blockade violated international law generally accepted that had been codified by several international agreements in the last two centuries.
The Britons mined the international waters to prevent any ships from entering segments complete of ocean, even if they were neutral.
Because there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany was expected to respond in kind.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among the majority of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid a situation like that in the future.
The year 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company of New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss at the last job he had) for Thomas Edison.
The Ancient China had a unique way of showing historical periods differently: each era of the Chinese or of each family in the power was a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was a period of unsettled provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these periods there were fierce wars between many of the nobles that fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most bloody periods in China's history, thousands of people died fighting to sit in the seat of power at the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just one person.
Simultaneously after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who applied.
This also applies to the military, because in place of class-based structures in the army, they now base the military on relevance.
The French Revolution inspired many other working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters that transcend this mundane life.
The own cave, which has survived the passage of time, gives a clear picture of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
De fet, and even knowing of its existence, it is absolutely impossible to find it.
There is not much you can see or hear from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians during the Third Dynasty.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Gizeh", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (among which, the Great Pyramid is the largest), several tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Kheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and temples are dedicated to the wives and members of the family of the Pharaoh.
The sign "upwards arrow" resembles the letter V (ve baixa) and the sign "downwards arrow" resembles a grape or a square without the bottom side.
When the arrow appears upside down, you have to push the bow in the opposite direction, and when the arrow is downside down, you have to push the bow in the opposite direction.
Cleaning the strings from right to left produces a softer sound, whereas cleaning the strings from left to right produces a louder sound.
Take the freedom to write your own marks, but remember that the marks of the arrow are for a musical reason, so you should respect them.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two younger children (Maria Teresa of 11 years and Louis-Charles of four years) and Madame Elisabeth, the younger sister of the King, were compelled by a mob of women traders to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and screamed threats against the King and the Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
In a certain point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a royal guard assassinated in Versailles before the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of the American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the people of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial American regime, in order to pay off the debts and interest of the floated Philippine government bonds through Wall Street banks.
For certain, the profits derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos would constitute the basic gains of imperialism in the United States.
To understand the Knights Templar, you have to understand the context that promoted the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history from the 10th to the 13th centuries (1.000 - 1.300 dC).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which lasted until 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a broad range of ideas, from the impetus of technology or the imperative of technology to a narrower sense that human fate is guided by a hidden logic that is associated with the laws of science and its manifestation in technology.
The majority of the interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technology in itself follows a course independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than being socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that motorized vehicles inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, a network of roads throughout the country for a few cars is not economically viable, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of having a car.
Car ownership is widespread in Venezuela.
Romanticism had a significant component of cultural determinism, drawn by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography gave shape to people, and over time customs and cultures became better than laws imposed arbitrarily, as they were in harmony with the place and with the society.
As Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered to be the capital of fashion in the feudal Europe.
His reputation for being a center of luxury began in the 4th century and lasted until the 11th century.
Their status waned during the twelfth century because the Crusaders had returned with gifts like silks and spices that had more value than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was in this moment that the title of capital of the fashion industry went from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak popularity in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 13th century.
Initially, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, and due to the slow communication channels, styles could often arrive in the west with 25 to 30 years delay.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time is that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
 subsistence farming is the farming that is done for subsistence.
The subsistence farming system is a simple, often organic, organic system that uses native seeds of the ecoregion combined with rotation of crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield.
Historically, most farmers in developing nations were subsistence farmers, and still is in many developing nations.
Subcultures gather individuals with similar ideas who feel abandoned by society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated based on age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as differentiated can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of the factors.
Members of a subculture often distinguish themselves from other subcultures by the symbolic use of a distinctive style, which includes modes, customs and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults while growing up, due to neglect, misfortune, or maltreatment.
These children are called "savages" or feral. Some of these children have been isolated by people (generally their parents); in some cases, this abandonment was due to the severe intellectual or physical disability of the child by part of the parents.
Children of the wild can have suffered child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Other supposedly have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all alone.
The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, exhibits (always within the physical limits) almost identical behaviors to those of the animal that raises him, such as fear or indifference in relation to humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the bastida brings it a step further.
The bastida theory is not a teaching method, but an aid that provides support to individuals who undergo a new learning experience, such as learning how to use a new computer program or embarking on a new project.
Virtual bastides can be:
Virtual bastides are internalized in the software and are designed to question, show and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to solve on his own.
Children are given in adoption for different reasons that range from abandonment to abuse, from extortion to kidnapping.
Children should not grow up in an environment where they are not fed, loved, and educated, but there are some who do.
We believe the foster care system is a form of safety for these children.
Our welfare system must provide safe homes, caring caretakers, healthy education and reliable healthcare.
Supposedly, welcoming confers all the needs that were not fulfilled in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements from mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification.
Examples such as "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for internet use (James et al., 1995).
Implicit personal and "relations in progress" were also identified as new motivating factors for Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated the reaction of the public to web sites.
The use of video recording has yielded important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by analyzing their micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The King's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand the speech due to damage to the brain but are still able to evaluate the sincerity of the speech very precisely.
He suggests that these abilities of human interpretation of human behaviour could be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
In the twentieth century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, and the selection eliminates it from the pool of genetic variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine backward and forward variation between the two gene pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its needs of amino acids with the resources available.
Poverty is widespread in Venezuela.
The plant resources most easily obtainable would have been the proteins in the leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like ourselves.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are digested easily, but they provide a great amount of protein that contain all the essential amino acids.
However, we should not surprise ourselves by the fact that our ancestors were able to solve our "protein problem" like today's chimpanzees in the savanna.
The interruption of sleep is the process of waking up during the normal period of sleep and returning to sleep again at a later time (10 - 60 minutes).
This is easy to do by using a quiet, noise-free alarm clock that makes you awake but does not wake you completely.
If you're one of those who rewinds the clock while sleeping, try to put it on the other end of the room, so you have to get up to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm include drinking many liquids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, in order to force oneself to urinate in the morning.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in body and spirit of one's self.
As the tension is lowered, so is the force vital present. Each person has the potential to find peace and satisfaction in life.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing holding us back is our own negativity and tension.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, but it is based on the teachings of Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Initially, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundaliní yoga, meditation, and universal love.
Yoga Kundalini awakens the kundalini energy (illustrated energy) by means of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of the Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity.
Germany was the common enemy in the Second World War, which made co-operation between the Soviet Union and the United States easier.
Two years after the end of World War II, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
The war lasted for forty years and was fought with armies delegated from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and to many other places.
The 17th of September 1939 the Polish defences had been penetrated and the only hope was to retreat and re-organize on the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans went out of date during the night, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered and created the fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after they had invaded the eastern regions of Poland violating the Treaty of Peace of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, bilateral or multilateral treaties, international or bilateral agreements.
Shipping is the most efficient method of transporting people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the marines traditionally has been to ensure that your country maintains the capacity to move people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with the capacity of your enemy to move people and goods.
One of the most recent examples is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Contemporarily, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, it is likely that Germany would have been able to conquer Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Sheep are thought to have been domesticated for the first time in the Zagros Mountains, Iran, around 10,000 years ago.
Cultures and tribes of ancient peoples began to domesticate them to obtain milk, meat, skins and fur.
Domestic sheep are kept in flocks that graze on hillsides or other areas of pasture, often watched by children or teenagers. These methods of grazing are still used today.
The trains were built in England in the mid-sixteenth century.
Though the rails consisted only of wooden planks, they pulled trains with horses to achieve faster speeds and to carry heavier loads in the most difficult sections.
Track ballast was introduced early to keep the rails in place.
This practice was common, but the iron wagon wheels wore out faster than the wooden wheels.
At the end, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were installed in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking, humans first started walking two million years ago with the emergence of the Homo erectus.
Australopithecine ancestors did not walk upright like modern humans.
Specializations in bipedalism have been found in fossils of australopithecines from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but australopithecines could have walked on two legs as late as 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live in a more sustainable way with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become environmental activists.
It works only as a symptomatic treatment for most of the cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and we should be able to disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot because of the advancements in science and technology, and the problems have grown because of the overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of humankind.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by the president of the Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary of the Congress, Charles Thompson, was sent to the printer John Dunlap to be printed.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which today are known as "Dunlap fliers".
The first public reading of the Declaration of Independence took place at Independence Hall on July 4, 1776.
A copy of the Declaration of Independence was sent to George Washington on June 6, 1776, and read to his troops in New York on July 6. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap brochures that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original manuscript copy of this document has not survived.
There are many paleontologists who believe today that a group of dinosaurs survived and that they are still alive.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many traits of birds that resemble the features of a dinosaur.
They have scales with sharp edges and claws, and they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus rex.
The vast majority of computers that we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary form.
A binary number can only have two possible values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these values are known as binary digits or bits, according to the computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be apparent immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, may be general, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an unopened medicine container or household toxic chemicals.
Search for specific instructions on first-aid treatment for the specific poison in the label.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient parasitic relationship with xinxes, which are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the red-backed woodpecker and the red-backed woodpecker are nidifugous, adapted to seeing in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the most common neurological disorder in young and adult middle-aged people.
Lyme disease is a neurological disease that affects the central nervous system, formed by the brain, spinal cord, and nerves.
Research has concluded that women have twice as many (2 times more) chances of having multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple can decide that raising a child isn't the best for their own interests or the interests of their child.
These couples can choose to adopt a baby.
A parental adoption, parents of birth lose their parental rights to the child.
The primary purpose of science is to discover how the world works through the scientific method.
Nowadays, experimentation is no longer the only thing, and experimentation is not the only way to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
The naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle accepted the opinions of Aristotle on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greeks waned, their philosophical and scientific achievements dwindled.
Many rhythms that are observed in the physiology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to external stimuli, have been documented in most living things, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks are self-oscillating oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the first indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used fags, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking the DNA of the virus with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the virus with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the cells affected are somatic cells or germline cells.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be passed on to the offspring, but mutations at any other site can cause cell death or cancer.
The tourism based on nature attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of in situ activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Each morning, people in small rural towns drive in their cars to go to work.
In this dynamic car, everyone, of some way, is connected with, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
The science shows today that this gigantic economy of coal has unsettled one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of man for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses public transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the quality of drinking water or the collapse of bridges.
Why transportation systems generate such complaints, why they fail daily? Is it because the engineers are incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The Traffic Flow Study is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict the driver's behaviour with 100% certainty.
Traffic flow tends to be relatively constant; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to be approximately constant.
To represent best the flow of traffic, relationships have been made between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operations of highway installations.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly enabled them to flee from enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings around their bodies.
This provides them with a great variety of tiny hiding spots where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can not fold their wings are the efímera and the dragonfly.
A man named Aristoteles once said that the solar system moves around the sun.
There was a lot of people who thought that what I was saying was true, but a lot of people believed the opposite; that the Solar System was moving away from Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems reasonable, because we don't have the impression that the Earth is moving, or do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. Transports 8 times more water than the second largest river on Earth.
The Amazon River is the widest river in the world, at six miles wide.
20% of the water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is the longest river in the world and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the pyramids of Gizah was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which then had a thousand years or more.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City State uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people living in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind since antiquity, in that they can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
It looked more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
Alloys can also contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
All the Universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that bilions of atoms would fit inside the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend of many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new methods of writing, the pencil has been relegated to a minor status and uses.
In the present day, people write messages on computer screens, without ever needing a pencil.
Only you can ask what the keyboard will become when something new emerges.
The fission bomb works with the principle that energy must be provided to unite a large number of protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart up a steep hill. Separating the core from the rest of the energy releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break up with a small collision or no collision at all.
The Moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust.
The core measures 70 kilometers in the closest part and 100 kilometers in the farthest part.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountainous regions.
It may be that there are more moons on the visible side of the moon because the crust is thinner there.
Theories of content focus on finding what interests or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized so that they mature towards adulthood.
These theories look at what makes people want things they want and what makes them want things they don't want.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Theory of the Two Factors.
In general, there can be two behaviors that leaders begin to lead their previous colleagues.
This type of manager has trouble taking difficult decisions, applying disciplinary actions, carrying out evaluations, assigning responsibilities and making others responsible for their own acts.
In the opposite case, one is transformed into an individual who feels that he or she has to change everything that has been going on in the team and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is the ultimate responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to fistfights between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as their conventional counterparts, but with a few small differences.
Members of a virtual group function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than conventional teams, as their teams can gather in different time zones than the local management can comprehend.
The presence of an "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the team that manages each member. The invisible team establishes standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to pass through the long process of establishing an organization learning organization? One of the goals for putting in place an organization learning organization is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization.
Together, an organization can overcome an adversity and lead to an innovative process to respond to the needs of the customer.
Because an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous improvement approach as a method used by organizations to achieve a higher level of performance.
The neurobiological data provided physical proof for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. Therefore, it reduces the area of inquiry and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain disorders and behavioral disorders is supported by the research of scientists.
It is known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumatisms, injuries, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
It provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Computer-aided intelligence (CAI) is an important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, programming, capacity to answer diagnostic questions, and recognition of writing, voice, and facial features.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as it has been built in a number of computer applications and video games.
School field trips are a major part of any classroom.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can see artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or enjoy the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual journey also is a great way to reflect on a journey and share the experiences with future students.
For example, each year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state's capital, each year the website is updated, but the older versions are maintained online as a book of records.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging forces students to be more astute with the world around them.
Blogging encourages students to broaden their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The use of blogs "can help students be more analytical and critical; they can define their positions in the context of what they write about other people and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics responding actively to materials on the internet (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and is home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
To the south there are the Niagara Falls and to the north there is the natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out from the rest of Canada to outsiders.
The population of the large expanses of land in the north is rather sparse, and some of the areas are almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison between populations that is surprising: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest continent by far, and a continent in itself in terms of wildlife.
The majority of the smallest islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts on the beach.
Arab Muslims also brought Islam to the lands, and they went on a great journey to Mayotte and Comores.
The influence of Europeans and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the route to the Cape of Good Hope to India.
In the north, the region limits with the Sahel, and in the south and west with the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female traveller should say that she is married, even if the true state of her marriage is unknown.
It is also useful to wear a nice necklace.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to harassment, and it is not uncommon for women to be harassed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Rebuff men with firmness, and don't be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and Phoenicians, Romans, and Benimerins used it as a strategic port, which was named Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, only to abandon it after a earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name of Dar al-Badya, the name of Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established bases in the city.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to do shopping in Morocco.
Around the old Medina we can easily find traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, ceramics, leather goods, narghulis, and souvenirs, but it is all designed for tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
L'any 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the city, especially the center.
Goma is relatively safe, but it would be wise to investigate before making any visits outside of this city to assess the state of the ongoing conflicts in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and for some of the cheapest gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (cycle taxis) to move around in Goma. The price is normally around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic lands, far away.
Today, Tombouctou is a poverty-stricken city, but its reputation as a tourist attraction makes it a tourist destination.
In 1990, the site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.
It was one of the main stops during the "Meravelles del món africà" special programme by Henry Louis Gates for the PBS.
The city is in strong contrast with the rest of the country because it has an Arabic-influenced atmosphere.
The Kruger National Park is situated in the north-east of South Africa and runs the border of Mozambique to the east, and the border of Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 ecozones, each supporting a different wildlife species.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South Africa's national parks.
As with all South African national parks, visitors must pay a conservation and entrance fee.
You can also purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry into a selection of South Africa's national parks.
The Island of Hong Kong is the namesake for the territory of Hong Kong and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.
The Hong Kong skyline is dominated by a brightly painted graphic of buildings.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the other side of the promenade in Kowloon.
The vast majority of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is densely populated along its northern coastline.
This is the place that the British colonizers occupied, therefore, it is a good place to start if you are looking for proof of the past colonial history of the territory.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans to be a World Heritage Site.
The forests are not just mangroves but also include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the plains of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3.850 km², of which around one-third is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it has been estimated that there are 400 Bengal tiger and 30,000 axis here.

Because buses between districts are often filled, it is advisable to purchase a ticket with a few days' notice.
The majority of districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to places close by, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River between the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, have a length of 378 meters, and have two traffic lanes of 3.50 meters each.
The open space in vertical under the bridge is 15 meters.
The bridge is expected to be fully functional in September 2017, when customs facilities in Brazil are expected to be completed.
The Guaranís were the most important indigenous group in the eastern part of today's Paraguay, and they lived as hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
The Paraguay, previously called "The Province of the Great Indies", was created in the sixteenth century as a result of the encounter between the Spaniards and the indigenous natives.
The Spaniards initiated the period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has maintained a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important annual polo tournament in the world takes place in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Club.
Here you can also see tournaments and smaller matches in other times of the year.
For news about tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged in the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
Generally, pound sterling is accepted everywhere in the British Virgin Islands and in Stanley as well.
In the outer islands, probably not accepted credit cards, but may accept British and American currency; check it with the owners in advance to determine which method of payment is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falkland Islands outside of the islands, so you have to go there to do it.
Because Montevideo is located in the south of the Equator, there is summer when in the Northern Hemisphere it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures over 30 °C are common.
The winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the feeling colder than what the temperature would suggest.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is more or less constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are not domesticated and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters from any wild animals and at least 25 yards/meters from the rest of wild animals!
Bears, bison, elk, and other large animals can be dangerous.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured by not keeping a safe distance from the animals. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Be aware that smells attract wild animals and other wild animals, therefore, avoid cooking with strong smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is situated on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous insubordination in 1889, when seven ships of Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruise liner.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Beaches are plentiful, as Auckland is located at the confluence of two ports.
The North Shore beaches (in North Harbour) stretch from Long Bay, in the north, to Devonport, in the south.
The majority of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the shores of Waitematā Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are often family friendly with a good selection of shops along the beach.
La cervesa local més coneguda és la "Number One"; no es tracta d'una cervesa complexa, però és agradable i refrescant. L'altra cervesa local es diu "Manta".
There are many French wines, but the New Zealand wines and Australian wines do not travel well.
It's safe to drink local tap water, but if you're afraid of contamination, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of a "shaved" is a foraster.
Chocolate milk arrives at Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but the quality is excellent.
During the whole year there are many trips to the reef and it is uncommon for any of these injuries to be caused by any of these causes.
Be careful and respect all signs and safety warnings.
Cubozoans can be found near beaches and estuaries from October to April.
Sharks exist, but sharks rarely attack humans.
Crocodile sharks are not active in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers in the north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller the security of knowing that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Agents of travel often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also reserve other forms of accommodation, such as camps, through an agent of travel.
The agents of travel often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or hotel, or both.
You can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to present other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any requests or suggestions should be sent first to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of the attendees decide to camp there, and the vast majority of the attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive early to get a spot where to camp close to the music.
It is important to remember that the music at the main stages of the festival will still be going on until late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, because crossing the ice generates a terrible noise in the worst affected.
Cruise ships in Saint Petersburg include a stop in the city.
Casinos tend to focus on maximizing the time and money their visitors spend at the casino.
They tend to have special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests entertained and encourage them to stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages inside the house. 

Catalan: 
Who drives in high latitudes or through mountainous terrain should consider the possibility that there might be snow, ice, or temperatures very cold.
The friction is low on ice-covered roads and snowy roads, and you can't drive as if you're driving on the asphalt.
During snow storms, snowfall amounts can be sufficient to trap you in a short period of time.
The visibility can also be reduced by snow that falls or is blown away by wind, or by condensation or ice on the windshield of your car.
The snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is usually uninterrupted during the whole year.
Possibly African safaris are the most important tourist attraction in Africa and one of the most important for many tourists.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to the travel on land to see the African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the equipment standard will allow for good views.
Animals such as lions, guepards, and leopards can sometimes be shy, so why not use a pair of binoculars?
A safari on foot (also called "trekking", "hiking" or "hiking trip") consists of walking, either for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Games, having hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the year 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you could find yourself in a difficult position.
The cancellation policies vary, but most cancel·lations due to coronavirus do not extend to July 2020, when the 2020 Summer Olympics were supposed to be held.
It is expected that most of the entrances to the event will cost between 2.500 ¥ and 130.000 ¥, with a typical ticket price of 7,000 ¥.
Drying clothes on a clothesline can help dry clothes.
If there isn't a flat iron available or if you don't like having your socks ironed, then you can try to use a hair dryer, if it is available.
Be careful not to allow the cloth to overheat (it could stretch or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, and some of them are more effective against certain dangers.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, a few minutes are needed.
Effectiveness changes from filter to filter, and in case of concerns, you should consider buying bottled water from a well-known brand in sealed bottles.
The travellers may encounter pests that are not familiar to them in their home regions.
Pest pests can damage food, cause irritation, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of injuring or killing people by force, are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and duties at duty-free shops.
Tax-free travelers from countries with high taxation can save a lot of money, especially in alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The Point Marion to Fairmont stretch of the Pennsylvania Turnpike is the most challenging stretch of the turnpike to drive.
If you are not accustomed to driving on country roads, be careful: there are many sharp curves, narrow roads, and tight bends.
The speed limits are notably lower than those of other sections of the highway - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to the speed limits is still more important than it would be elsewhere.
Though it is curious, the mobile phone service is more powerful here than in many other segments of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German bakery is good and the Bavarian bakery is very diverse, like the Austrian.
Fruit-flavored pastes are common, with apples and pears cooked into pastes all year round and cherries and plums that appear in summer.
Many German-made baked goods also contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts.
If you want little pastries, but filled with flavor, try the Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish consisting of spices and herbs, along with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in the south of India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is common.
With 17,000 islands to choose, Indonesian food is a generic term for covering a wide variety of regional cuisines that can be found all over the country.
But, if the term is used without any other qualifier, the term means the food originating from the central and eastern regions of the island of Java.
Today, Javanese cuisine is easy to find everywhere in the archipelago and offers a great variety of dishes condimented in a simple way.
Stirrups are support for the rider's feet that hang down from each side of the saddle.
Horses are more stable for the rider, but they can present safety problems because the rider's feet could get caught in the stirrups.
If a rider falls off his horse but has one foot on the saddle, he could be thrown from the horse if the horse runs too fast. To minimize this risk, safety precautions can be taken.
First, riders wear boots with a heel and a thick sole.
Some saddles have safety bars that allow the leather strap of the saddle to fall off if the rider jumps off the horse.
The valley of Cochamó: the most renowned climbing destination in South America, also called the Yosemite of South America, features many granite walls of great dimensions and cliffs.
There are amazing views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world establish continuously new routes.
Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of skiing or snowboarding down slopes covered with snow.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, often referred to as "ski bums", who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a particular destination.
The concept of skiing is very old - there are prehistoric paintings symbolizing skiing dating back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport is at least as old as alpine skiing as a sport, but it was in the year 1861 that the first ski club in Australia was opened.
Ski mountaineering: this activity is also called backcountry skiing, backcountry skiing, ski touring, ski mountaineering, or ski mountaineering.
Snowboarding generally does not involve alpine skiing or mountain skiing, which require stiffer, more rigid skis and boots.
Imagine a skiing route like a hiking route.
In good condition, you will be able to cover longer distances than walking - although in few occasions you will achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries.
The Schengen zone works as a single country in this regard.
While you're in this zone, generally you can cross borders without having to re-pass through immigration control.
De la mateixa forma, having a Schengen visa does not need to apply for separate visas for each of the Schengen countries separately, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universally accepted definition for articles manufactured that are considered antique. Some tax agencies determine that goods over 100 years old are antique.
The definition has differing geographical boundaries, where the age limit can be lower in places like North America in comparison to Europe.
Crafts can be described as antique, but they are more recent than other mass-produced items.
The reindeer herding industry is a major source of income for the Sami people and their culture.
Even in the tradition, however, not all Samis have been associated with the herding of reindeer.
Today, many Sami work in modern jobs.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Gypsy" is often considered offensive because of its association with stereotypes and negative perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you're visiting is subject to any traffic warning, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
Maybe you can be interested in hearing the recommendations of other governments, but their recommendations are made for their own citizens.
For example, Americans in the Middle East could be exposed to different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The councils are simply a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The considerations presented are brief, general, and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available at any other place.
Extreme weather condition is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause significant damage, disruptions to society, or loss of life.
We can expect extreme weather anywhere in the world, and there are many different types of weather that can depend on the geography, topography, and weather conditions.
