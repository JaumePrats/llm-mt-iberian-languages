In the PALM trial, Zmapp was used as a control, i.e. as a base for comparison with the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the IOC Athletes Commission statement and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family create a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and sports can be best served by significant changes within our organization, rather than the withdrawal of certifications.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can clarify how the abuse of Larry Nassar's power over so many survivors could have gone undetected for so long and accepts any necessary and appropriate changes.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and enhanced environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and later for Lyndon B. Johnson.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a theory that is already widely accepted, it also provides specific data that fossils generally do not, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this bird has a reddish-brown upper plumage and a pale or carotene lower plumage.
Moreover, the discovery allows a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs are not well developed, but do have other feather-like features (quills and barbs), the researchers concluded that the raquis is probably the result of an evolutionary development of these other feather-like features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that their function was not related to flight, but to temperature regulation or as an indicator of the same. The researchers argue that, although the tail feather of a young dinosaur is being analysed, the sample exhibits the characteristics of an adult plumage and not of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, it illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

He said that no one could give guarantees that any Iraqi action at this point would halt sectarian violence, growing violence or a tendency towards chaos.
The report begins with a call for open debate and consensus-building in the United States on Middle East policy.
The report is highly critical of virtually every aspect of the current policy of the executive branch in Iraq, and calls for an immediate change of direction.
It contains 78 recommendations, the first of which is the adoption of a new initiative before the end of the year with the purpose of protecting the borders of Iraq from hostile operations and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbours.
Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who is currently a senator and is the first lady of the Argentine Republic, announced last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometres (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, that she would be running for president.

Although it was a highly theoretical work, the programme was written with the purpose of simulating the observations made on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The dark matter forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and the Milky Way would be the cause of the expected effect by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the galaxy of Sagittarius in the same way as the moon exerts a gravitational pull on our planet and causes the tides.
The experts concluded that dark matter is affected by itself in the same way as regular matter.
This theory holds that the majority of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy is in the form of a halo and consists of numerous small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province.
During an interview, he said that the new variant generated "much concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate."
Dr Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus within the hospital and that at least two of the infected were staff of the hospital.
In a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom he or she has had close contact.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among the total TB cases in South Africa still appears to be low: 6 000 of a total of 333 000 individuals infected at a particular point in time in South Africa.

The police said the body had been there for about a day.
The first cases of the disease during this season were reported in late July.
Pigs are the carriers of the disease, which then migrates to humans through mosquitoes.
The outbreak has led the Indian authorities to take measures such as the deployment of pig hunters, the distribution of millions of mosquito nets to the population and the use of pesticides in the most affected areas.
The authorities have also guaranteed several million doses of the vaccine to fight against encephalitis, which will allow health care companies to prepare for the next year.
This year, the scarcity of financial resources and the lack of prioritization, compared with other diseases, have resulted in delays in the implementation of the vaccination plans in historically vulnerable regions.

In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a booth and insert a preprinted ballot into a preprinted envelope that indicates the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter enters the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
French electoral law sets out the procedures in a fairly strict manner.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent, which allows voters and observers to verify that there are no surplus ballots at the start of voting and that no additional ballots are added that are not those of the voters, properly counted and authorized.
Candidates have the right to send representatives to monitor each stage of the process and, during the night, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

16 February is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are due to appear before Westminster Magistrates Court.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21, died. Alden was driving.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider required facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon jammed as he aimed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider suffers permanent pain, has lost one eye and part of his skull was reconstructed with titanium.
Schneider gave testimony via a virtual link from a United States Air Force base in his country of origin.
Carpanedo took part in two individual races apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he received a "Did not finish first race" result, as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In her other event, the giant slalom, she finished 10th in the women's sitting category with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth finalist, Gyöngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four slalom skiers in the category failed to complete their races and a total of 45 slalom giant racers failed to qualify for the race.
The police force of Madhya Pradesh was able to recover the laptop and the mobile phone stolen.
The Deputy Inspector General, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five persons who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite the fact that there were three people inside the house at the time of the impact of the car, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver of the Audi TT red from the vehicle.
At first, he was transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital, Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is under arrest awaiting trial, any witness testimony may be questioned, as her image has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but as the Scottish justice system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee said: "Journalists seem to be walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecutions, said it would not be making any further comments until the indictment was issued.
According to information leaked, the document will deal with the conflict on the border, which the Palestinians wish to resolve based on the existing boundaries prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also discussed, according to information available, included the future status of Jerusalem, which both countries regard as sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while PA is willing to accept five.
During the supplementary pest control trial, game scouts were to closely monitor the shooters, given that they were being monitored and evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the NSW Sporting Shooters Association (NSW), suitably qualified volunteers were recruited into the Association's shooting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is currently in charge of the Conservation and Heritage Office of NPWS, said that comprehensive training and safety briefings were given to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP, for its English acronym) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP of Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the CEP resign, as part of a series of measures designed to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way that Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, at times violent, were triggered by the fact that elections were not being held, in some cases since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPods with problems of malfunctioning and overheating have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that 27 accidents involving these devices had been registered.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious."
The ministry said it was disappointed by Apple's delay in submitting its report, saying it was "truly regrettable."
Mariana was shaken by a 7.2-magnitude earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Agency reported no damage on the Northern Marianas.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer kidnapped a bus and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to study medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and worked at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland from 1959.
Liggins began his research on preterm birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that investigators for the government had recovered the flight recorders from the black box.
The comrades of Luna also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Oro in Dusty Runnels declared: "Luna was as rare as I am, even more so. I love her and I will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Since 2008, of the 1400 respondents in the 2010 federal election pre-poll, 8 per cent had indicated that they were opposed to Australia becoming a republic.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the reign of Queen Elizabeth II had ended.
34 per cent of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Isabel II to be the last Queen of Australia.
On one end of the survey, 29 per cent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; on the other, 31 per cent believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal winner in the 100-metre and 200-metre freestyle events and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned following his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers because they are prohibited in the Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using various hardware and software and the news was made public on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets have been a source of water and organic matter for our planet, as well as the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets, including our own, are formed, given that comets have crashed into the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a bill that allows same-sex couples to marry.
He dismissed the rumours as "political gossip and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce flight distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old radar technology, in order to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transport will be provided and trains will not stop at Wembley.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors was considered, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the science magazine Science reported on the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University, in the United States, and from Uppsala University, in Sweden, said the new species had evolved in just two generations, even though it was estimated to take much longer, because of the low rate of reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migrant, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can take any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
It is not only possible to hammer and roll into sheets, but also to stretch it out to a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It is so thin that it can be used to decorate illustrations made by hand in books called "manuscript illuminations".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Thus, a hydrogen ion is the result of removing a proton from an electron.
Mix both powders together and, after mixing, with clean and wet hands, form a ball.
A reaction will take place between the moisture on his hands and the external layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost all houses with in-house toilets with drainage to a sophisticated sewerage system.
In some households in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewerage systems were found.
They also had sanitary facilities in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and, then, reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched into space through a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of the light and vision that we have.
A giant rocket is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in ways that are still surprising. The most important thing it has done for us is to give us a much simpler and faster means of transport.
Thanks to her we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer.
Finally, there are many small wild cats (including domestic cats) that feed on species of small size that are in much greater abundance, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Its success is based on the concept of niche: each cat has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the social cats and their life is spent in large groups called prides.
The herds are formed by one to three adult males from the same family group, with up to thirty females and their offspring.
Generally, females are closely related to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in the same way as wolf packs or dogs, with a remarkable similarity to the other great cats (unlike the other big cats, which are highly dangerous to their prey).
The tiger is a complete athlete, able to climb (but not very well), swim, dive, make long jumps and pull five times as hard as a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but rather a sentence of words spoken in growls and shouts.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. In the event, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all their prey will be smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (prey) through their sense of smell, smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and can move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pounce on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it comes (for example, if it moves to a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment to that which it was used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
No changes have occurred in the original population, which still requires the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, as the growing population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble less and less the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale (which they emit).
Plant food is generated by photosynthesis, using solar energy. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and also make clothes from them. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so it had nothing to fear, except from other Mosasaurus.
His long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another group in the palate, which meant that anything that came his way had no escape.
We do not know, but it could have been a viper. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and even cannibalism.
It also attacked any creature that entered the water: even a T. Rex was no match for him.
While most of that food would be familiar to us, the Romans also ate some rather unusual items at their banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that distinguished the poor from the rich was that the poor ate sitting down on a chair, while the rich enjoyed sharing banquets and lying down while eating.
It is impossible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no maize, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao and no Roman of antiquity ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of the people by holding ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramidal towers were built, called ziggurats, to be part of temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was of little importance.
Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only showrooms that faced the street. Houses were built with stone.
In Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Few people lived in Greenland. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey that took him more westward, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to its discovery, the Eskimo tribes had already inhabited the area at that time.
While each country was Scandinavian in its own right, there were significant differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and the history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Treasure Nation, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. The reverse of the document contains something written, but it is not a map of a treasure.
The Declaration of Independence has the words "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776" written on its reverse. The text is on the lower part of the document, upside down.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that the document was written on a large sheet of parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) and rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation was added only as a label.
While the landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, the south was still to be won.
His government was in the hands of the French Vichy, who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and were working with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, Operation "Dragon" was launched, through which the Allies invaded the south of France.
In only two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated the south of France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together; in other words, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and relates both to the word civis, of the same language, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city state and which, in addition, determines the size of the society.
The state cities are the forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization requires a long-term generational transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogeneous propagation.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving any significant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilisations in their own right.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was the only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes and, given that it had a national executive or judicial power, the function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
It was not empowered to annul fiscal laws or customs between States.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all states for their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second team in the world with the most wins and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports most popular are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the north, with athletes who participate in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
Japan has about 7000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed through the area registered the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, which means Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in the southwest of Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the indigenous method of grain production, with the employment of Chinese labour to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty army (1644-1912) took control of the coastal and western regions of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which retained control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three major buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings have been reconstructed at the ends of the complex so that tourists can see how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 per cent of Machu Picchu had been restored and work continues today.
For example, the most common format for fixed-image photography worldwide is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the era of analogue photography.
Today, it is still being produced, but the most important thing is that the dimensional relationship has been transferred to the digital image sensors of the cameras.
In truth, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, since its dimensions are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Thus, the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by twelve to calculate the simplest integer quotient) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g. the APS group) are similar or very similar to this relationship of appearance.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and many times mocked, is a simple rule that generates dynamism while at the same time allowing for some order to be imposed on the images.
The most effective position for the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting European states despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected all, from the king to the people.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are reserved for that specific purpose.
The central leadership of the church had remained in Rome for more than a thousand years and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such a measure violated generally recognized international law and was contained in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom extracted international waters in whole sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, even putting at risk the safety of neutral vessels.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany believed that it would encounter a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with Edison in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poems and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his last employer) addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient China had a unique way of delimiting the different periods of time. Each dynasty or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a cruel war broke out among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms, when thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
They have many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the displacement of absolutism towards republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military, since now the charges are based on rank, rather than class.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed workers in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Mohammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave called "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has survived over time, realistically illustrates the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
In the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, lies a cave totally isolated from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one were sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous mountains in the vicinity. From the inside of this cave, one can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Guiza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the third century B.C., is one of the many pyramids of the same shape and size built to honour the deceased pharaoh.
The Guiza Necropolis, or "Valley of the Kings", in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built in honour of his wives and relatives.
The "upward arc" mark resembles a V and the "downward arc" mark resembles a grapheme or a square without its lower border.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
The ascending arc generates a softer sound, whereas the descending arc is more abrupt and forceful.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but please remember that the marks on the bow have been printed there for a musical purpose and should be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the sister of the king, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a executed guard in front of the Queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war expenses of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial United States regime with the purpose of paying the majority of the interest and principal on the Philippine bonds that fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government in the Wall Street banks.
The superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of profits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in which these events took place is known as the Middle Ages, between the years 1000 and 1300 (that is, between the years 1000 and 1300).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
The technological determinism concept includes, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from the technological imperative to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and its relationship with the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on an independent path from any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of cars necessarily implies the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new techniques of manufacture are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a vehicle.
The widespread use of motor vehicles also leads to a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to studies by Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography moulded people and, over time, customs and cultures developed that were related to that geography and, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
Its fame as the centre of luxury began approximately 400 B.C. and extended to approximately 1100 A.D.
During the twelfth century its status declined, in particular because, on their return, the Crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of "fashion capital" was transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Western Europe began to develop its own style in the late Middle Ages. One of the most significant developments of this period was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothes.
Agriculture for subsistence is understood to be that which aims at producing sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family exclusively.
Simple subsistence agriculture is a practice that combines the use of locally stored seeds with the rotation of crops or other simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of social marginality and provides them with the opportunity to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a combination of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic style by using distinctive and symbolic dress, gestures and language.
One of the most common mechanisms for graphically illustrating the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and lamentable cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called &quot;wild&quot;. Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the rejection of the parents of a child with a severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or running away.
It is said that others were raised by animals and that some have lived in the wild.
When a child is reared exclusively by animals different from humans, his behaviour is almost entirely similar to that of the animal that cared for him, as well as his fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is rather a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new software package or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in real or virtual form; to put it another way, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also a small animated paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand on their own.
Children are taken into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care and education; but it happens.
We can see that the family-based care system provides a safe environment for these children.
The objective of our foster care system is to provide safe, loving homes, consistent, quality education and reliable medical care.
The purpose of family placement is to meet all needs that were not met in the previous home.
The Internet is a combination of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The different features of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal participation" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are brief facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed that, by reading microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, however, judge the sincerity of a speaker with precision.
It even suggests that the ability to interpret human behaviour can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The process of mutation introduces a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination balance the variation between one and the next generation.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as that of a human, to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources available to it.
Not doing so carries serious consequences: slowing of growth, malnutrition and, in the end, death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of vegetable food, but they are not easily digestible for us, except when cooked.
In contrast, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not surprise us if our own predecessors had solved their "protein problems" in the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannah do today.
Interrupted sleep is waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then falling asleep again (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved easily with a soft alarm clock that will wake him up without waking him completely.
The registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will have to register your presence and address with local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to bed, which will oblige him to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The more relaxed the tension, the more positive is the force of life with which we can cope. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all attain enlightenment. The only thing that blocks the way is our tension and negativity.
While the basis of Tibetan Buddhism is the teachings of Buddha, it has been extended along the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, laísmo is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated by yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualization.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be unblocked, the chakras activated and the consciousness of enlightenment developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the system, process and culture clashes ended up separating the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who had been allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and would be fought in earnest, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
Due to the fact that the Polish defence had already broken down on 17 September 1939, its only hope was to give up the fight and reorganize itself in the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is a much more efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The function of the navy has always been to ensure that a country retains the ability to move its population and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The Atlantic campaign in World War II provides one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to cut off this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it had done in the other European countries.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10 000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
With the aim of easily obtaining their milk, wool, meat and skins, the ancient peoples and tribes started to take them.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of pasture, often tended by shepherd boys or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.
In England, railway tracks had been laid out in the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carts were made of simple wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and to carry heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The introduction of sleepers to maintain the rails in place was quite early. However, gradually it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron on their upper part.
This became a common practice, although iron wheels caused more wear on the wooden railway carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 iron rails were used for the first time.
The first form of transport was walking. Man began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While bipedal traces have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more friendly with the planet, join environmental movements or even become activists and fight to lessen, in some way, the future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment. But if we are not only looking for a temporary situation, we should try to find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
It is manifest that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of the technological and scientific advances of mankind, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
Approximately 150 to 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the «Dunlap copies».
It was John Nixon who read the document for the first time and read it in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on 8 July.
On 6 July a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it to be read to his army in New York on 9 July. On 10 August another copy arrived in London.
The 25 Dunlap photographs, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaly limbs and claws, lay eggs and move on their hind legs in the same way as the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate on the basis of the binary coding of data.
A binary number can only have two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to allow for an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning is finding an open bottle of medicine or toxic cleaning products.
Read the label for specific information on the appropriate first aid for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasite insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with fleas, a species very developed for parasiting humans.
The bedbugs and the clothes moths are nidicolous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) cases in the United States are estimated at about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
The studies indicated that women have twice the likelihood of developing EM than men.
A couple might conclude that having a baby would not be the most appropriate thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to adopt a baby.
In one adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not an experiment, but a test that is used to discard one or more of the possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on the classical works; especially, on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's thoughts, especially those of science, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, Western civilization distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behaviour depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythms, which are not only reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate stably and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA was a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using phages, or viruses.
Two experiments were performed in which the DNA of the fungus was marked with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA of the fungus was marked with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation may have various effects.
Only mutations in germinal cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wildlife and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks, and study of information on the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and often meet others who have just left the place where they work.
In this dynamic transfer vehicle, everyone is somehow connected with a transport system based on the use of private cars, and supports it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity over the last two million years.
All are part of society and use the transport systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear such complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
What is the reason for such complaints and why are they occurring daily? Are the engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of their interactions.
It is a difficult task to study traffic flow, since it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency among drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to be represented by a logical and approximate mathematical model.
In order to graphically illustrate the flow, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Such relationships facilitate both planning and design as well as the operation of road devices.
The first species to take to the air were insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back, pressing them against their bodies.
This provides a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, only the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera are unable to fold their wings.
Long ago, a man called Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since on Earth it is not perceived to be moving, &quot;yes&quot;.
The Amazon is the world &apos; s largest river and the second largest in volume. It contains eight times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river in the world, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water from the world &apos; s rivers that flows into the oceans, 20 per cent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6,387 km (3,994 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of the pyramids of Guiza.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Holy See is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest in population.
Italian is used in the Vatican City for drafting its legislation and for issuing its official communiqués.
The language that most people working in the state use daily is Italian, and Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in the Vatican City State are Roman Catholic.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, since they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, but it also had the theory that they are transformed into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to be the elements calcium and potassium. Metals of the type of gold and silver are also known.
It is also possible that alloys with small amounts of carbon, which are not metals, may be present.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
Thus, when the pencil was invented, it won many friends.
Unfortunately, the implementation of new writing methods has led to the use of the pencil less and it has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They do not even need to approach a pencil.
The only question is what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy cart is rolled up a hill. By dividing the nucleus once more, it releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which tend to disintegrate with the slightest or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer shell is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more lakes on the side closer to the volcano because the crust is thinner, which facilitated the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These theories hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they have grown to maturity.
These theories analyse what makes certain people want certain things and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two very well-known theories are Maslow &apos; s hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg &apos; s two-factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour when managers start leading their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum is the attempt to continue to be "one of the boys" (or girls).
The managers in this category find it difficult to take decisions that are unpopular with employees, to impose disciplinary measures, to carry out performance appraisals, to assign responsibilities and to demand accountability from staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into a person who believes that everything that has been done up to now must be changed and done in his own way.
In the end, the ultimate success or failure of the team is the leader.
This behaviour often leads to the leaders of the team being distanced from the other members of the team.
The same standards of excellence that apply to conventional teams apply to virtual teams, although there are some small differences.
Virtual teams frequently operate as a point of contact for their physical team.
They generally enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, because it is possible for their teams to meet at different times, for example, which might not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109) is also a unique element of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group in charge of managing and to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each member.
What motive could an organization have for submitting to the process of establishing an organization for learning?
When all available resources are used effectively in operational departments of an organization, space is created for creativity and ingenuity.
This may lead to a process of an organization working together to overcome a place-bound difficulty in order to address the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first create a culture of innovation, as well as a shared knowledge base and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research. They therefore reduce the field of research and increase its accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour contributes to the research of scientists.
For a long time it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material for developing simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important field within computer science, which deals with the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to diagnose and respond to client queries, as well as facial, handwriting and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial Intelligence is now often used in the fields of economy, medicine, engineering and military, as well as in various applications of computer software and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of every classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours. Students can see the exhibits in a museum, visit an aquarium or view beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on an exit and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital and each year the page is updated, but the previous versions are archived as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with a grammar and spelling that is not particularly careful, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger begins to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also requires that students be more understanding of the world around them. The need to engage the audience inspires them to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active responses to internet content, can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, and can establish their perspectives on specific topics
Ottawa is the captivating bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the history and the present of the country.
The Niagara Falls are located more south and the natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows are located north of it.
These aspects, among others, are what make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas north of the line are sparsely populated and some are wild land, almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that causes great surprise to many: more African Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the islands of East Africa is on the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wild life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial impact of European and colonial influence took place in the 15th century, following the discovery by the Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, of the route linking Cape of Good Hope with India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it is not too expensive).
Women must be made aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be round in rejecting men and not fear defending your position (cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century and the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenids used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of the White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed VI under the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, there are many places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as earthenware pots, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, but everything is geared to tourists.
Goma is a tourist point in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, any trip outside the city should be considered in order to obtain information on the continuing conflict in the North Kivu province.
The city is the base for scaling Mount Nyiragongo and its gorilla trekking excursions are the most economical in Africa.
To move within Goma, you can take a moto-taxi (motorbike taxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with the fact that it is relatively inaccessible, has given "Tombuctú" an exotic and distant image.
Tombuctú is a poor city today, but it still has an airport and its reputation makes it an attractive tourist destination.
In 1990, it was included on the World Heritage List, as a result of the threat posed by desertification.
It was one of the most important stops on the African Specials of Henry Louis Gates, Jr., on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends along the eastern border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has a surface area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 ecozones, each of which has a different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognised as the icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all South African nature reserves, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
A Wild Card can also be useful for visiting a selection of parks in South Africa or all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the island, which is the destination of most tourists who consider it the main attraction.
The comparison of the skyline of Hong Kong with a bar chart of illuminated bars showing the presence of Victoria Harbour waters was made.
The best views of Hong Kong are to be had by leaving the island and going to Kowloon, which is located on the opposite side.
It is in the reclaimed lands of the northern coast of Hong Kong where the city is most densely developed.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you wish to see evidence of the past colonial history of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The Indian section of the forest is called Sundarbans National Park.
While this is so, the forests are not only mangroves, but also contain some of the last remaining trees of the once mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3,850 km2 and approximately one third of its area is covered by water or swamp.
The Sundarbans have been, since 1966, a sanctuary for wild life and it is estimated that there are now 400 tigers and 30 000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the bus station to the districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, but most, especially those going to Jakar (also called Bumthang) leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the fact that buses between districts are often full of passengers, it is recommended to buy a ticket in advance.
Almost all districts have the Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a convenient and comfortable way of travelling to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the river, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two 3.5 m wide lanes.
Under the bridge there is a free space of 15 metres and, although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is expected to be completed by September 2017, which is when it is expected that the Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that is now the eastern part of Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the most important indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence farming.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá indigenous groups in the region hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
The Spaniards started the stage of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the establishment of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its aboriginal identity and idiosyncrasy.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and best players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower-level matches may also be held at other times of the year.
Information on the Argentine Polo Association site will be available on the polo tournaments and where to buy tickets for the games.
The Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed at par with the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. It is located in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Sterling is accepted at any place within the islands. In Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
There is a possibility that the islands in the periphery will not accept credit cards, but will accept British or American money. Ask the owners in advance which method of payment is accepted.
It is practically impossible to change money outside the Falkland Islands, so do so before leaving.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the tropics, with frequent temperatures above +30° C during the summer.
Winter cold can be deceptive: while it is very rare for temperatures to fall below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically "rainy" or "dry" stations; the amount of rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild life is still wild, and should not be fed or interfered with.
According to the instructions of the park authorities, at least 100 yards/metres must be maintained from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/metres from other wild animals.
Although they may appear to be very gentle, bison, bighorn sheep, elk, bears and most large animals can be very aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors are injured each year by not maintaining a safe distance from the animals. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
Please also remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted by smells, so please avoid cooking food that releases a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of approximately 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. About two hundred Americans and Germans were killed.
During the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the state chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland has two ports. The most famous are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district of Auckland, North Shore beaches extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all sand with safe swimming places and most have pohutukawa trees providing shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in the extravagant Mission Bay and St Heliers suburbs of Auckland are being rolled out.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available on the beach. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complicated, but rather refreshing and pleasant. The other regional beer is Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia may be considered better for transport.
The local tap water is perfectly safe for drinking, but if he is concerned, he will find bottled water easily.
Australians consider the notion of "white coffee" foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccino is served with cream (rather than foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and, there, wounds of any kind are rare.
Please take the advice of the authorities, respect all the signals and pay special attention to security alerts.
The jellies are found near the beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April, north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where the saltwater crocodiles are actively living. Their primary habitat is the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
The advance booking of accommodation gives the traveller the peace of mind that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, but it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through them.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They may also keep the offer in reserve in case they need time to think it over, or to obtain other documents for their destination (for example, a visa).
However, any modification or request should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the majority of those attending the music events decide to camp at the site and most of the audience consider this to be a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to see the action, then you should arrive early to get a place near the music events.
It is important to note that, while musical performances may have ended, other areas of the festival may continue until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the Baltic in winter, check where the bridge is located, as crossing the ice generates a very annoying noise for those most affected.
During the cruises to St. Petersburg, time is also spent in the city. Those who disembark are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos normally make great efforts to maximise the time and money that their customers spend. There are no windows or clocks and exits can be difficult to find.
Special food, drink and entertainment promotions are often offered to keep guests in good spirits and within the premises.
Some establishments serve free spirits. Although drunkenness affects judgment and every good player knows the importance of keeping sober.
Any person who intends to drive in high latitudes or in mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy or snow-covered roads, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as one does on the bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, a large amount of snow can fall so that it traps a person in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by snow or ice on the windows of the car.
In many countries, ice and snow are normal conditions and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely to be the most attractive tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable for many visitors.
The term safari is used to refer to the popular African land-based safaris to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are known to approach vehicles and the standard equipment will provide good visibility.
Leopards, lions and jaguars can be shy, so you will have a better chance of seeing them using binoculars.
The known as "walking safari" (also known as "walking between the bushes", "safari on foot" or "walk") consists of walking, whether for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. A number of events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo, the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, will be the only Asian city to host the 2020 Olympic Games.
If you have already booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, there may be complications.
There are different types of cancellation insurance policies, but since the end of March, the coverage of most of these coronavirus-based policies does not extend until July 2020, which is when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that most of the entries to the events will cost between JPY 2,500 and JPY 130,000 and that common passes will cost JPY 7,000.
