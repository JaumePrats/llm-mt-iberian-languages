Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM, Welsh Assembly Members) are concerned about appearing "muppets".
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Member of Parliament said that his group was concerned that "we would be left with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: Twp means "idiot" and pwp means "shit".
A Member of the Welsh Assembly commented that his group was "disappointed" and had suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member in Wales said his group was "open" to a name change, but noted that the jump from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of Assembly Members will be a matter for the Assembly Members themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed strong support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred Members of Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the option MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
It appears that Assembly Members are suggesting alternatives, but the fight for consensus could scupper the bill, which Assembly President Elin Jones should be sending to the Assembly in a few weeks.
The legislation on reform will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Members and the design of the committee system.
The Assembly Members will have the final say on how the names are to be called when legislation is being considered.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether their country will be called "Republic of Macedonia (North)".
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that its northern neighbour's name implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are silent in Harlem
Mr Adams said that historically, people he had spoken to said there was a pub and a church on every corner.
Today, there is neither one nor the other.
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
He says people now socialise in different ways.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods that people visit regularly."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect and that "they will eventually come back to square one".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks full of people who would not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighbourhood.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people, and therefore they will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these apartments will be members of these churches.
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community Church in 1870 and St. Martin's in 1880.
The original white Methodist congregation disappeared in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped in the building acquired it.
A black congregation took over St. Martin's, under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were resisting hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while the congregation of Father Johnson was planning for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the bell.
The Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in San Martin, proudly called them "the campaigns of the poor."
In July, the expert who played the drum called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first drum set used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the Riverside Church drum set 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that San Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish council, the parish governing body, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was "trying to pass the costs" to the parish council, even though it had not been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old boy shot by shark while diving for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while he was diving for abalone in California on the opening day of the abalone season, according to authorities.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child calling for help, so he swam over with a group to rescue him.
Hammel said he initially thought he was just excited about having caught a lobster, but then realised he was "screaming that he had been bitten".
He had a broken collarbone, Hammel said as he approached the child.
Hammel said: "I shouted at everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark."
The child was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in a critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had upper torso injuries.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there were more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's beauty plans drive the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many specialist staff in their beauty and style departments.
In order to significantly boost the beauty market in the United Kingdom, valued at £28 billion and growing at a rate higher than the decline in fashion and homewares sales, the largest beauty halls will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they succeed, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty offer with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
There will also be more space for existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, with similar areas to those in other Boots stores.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range, with the majority of products being animal-friendly, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also be testing its concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the move towards buying smaller quantities of food from local shops every day are forcing supermarkets to work harder to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said that supermarkets will increasingly resemble shopping centres as the chain tries to combat discount retailers Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points into hundreds of stores and introduced Habitat stores since it bought the chains two years ago. It is believed that this has driven food sales and made the acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a disagreement over how to divide the profits from the pharmacy sales in its supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of 281 Sainsbury's pharmacies to Lloyds Pharmacy owner Celesio for £125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will be participating in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
As Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers."
We have also invested in a specialist team that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offer is designed to meet all needs. On the other hand, an attractive environment and a convenient location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks a £11 million deal
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones was "furious" after Holly Willoughby broke a £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for fashion and accessories with Truly.
This business had been compared to Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving the business.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by quitting her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the girl who won gold on television admitted that her new deals, worth up to £1.5 million, left no time for her Truly fashion and accessories brand.
The business had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was being positioned as a favourite to double Willoughby's fortune, which was estimated at £11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving his business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: "Holly was truly the main priority for Holly."
It was to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
Their decision to leave left everyone involved completely stunned.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters, ready to go on sale.
Experts believe the departure of one of Britain's most profitable stars could cost millions to the company due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly delay the launch even further.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as president in March.
Couples went on holidays together and Jones had a 40 % stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become the face of Marks & Spencer and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!
A source close to Jones said that last night "no business issues were discussed".
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some might consider "not presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump spoke in his mock-newsman voice.
He has not given up anything.
He said Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that his country had not seen an "appropriate response" from the United States to its first steps towards denuclearization.
In contrast, he said, the United States was still applying sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump's speech at his rally was much more optimistic than the speech he gave at his rally.
He said: "We get on great with North Korea."
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
We now have a fantastic relationship.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, help to free hostages and bring home the remains of American soldiers killed in action.
He also defended his unusual approach to the relationship with Kim.
It is very easy to be president, but then, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this full stadium, we would have 200 people right here.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, NGOs were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had been displaced, no national emergency had been declared, a prerequisite for international assistance.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which makes things a little more complicated.
Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, but they are still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the national disaster agency spokesman, said the authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations could provide assistance.
Given that Indonesia is constantly moving, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not as common in other coastal areas.
It is likely that the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even if there was a warning in advance, contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, travelling from one Indonesian island to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the central focus of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railways.
However, a lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr Joko, who is facing re-election next year.
It must also face the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge, of Liverpool, scores against Chelsea.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge saved a point for the Reds with a late equaliser in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri from more than 27 metres out from Chelsea's goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot before kicking it to the second post.
The action sent it over the area and towards the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who tried to stop it with a leap and fell into the net.
Sturridge said: "I was trying to get myself in that position to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play very advanced, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible."
I saw Kante coming and gave him a nudge. I didn't think too much about it, I just let it go.
Chelsea were winning 1-0 at half-time after Eden Hazard had scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' right-back made a neat pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning and dribbling into the Liverpool half and entering the field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran into the middle.
He then made a lovely pass to Hazard, who took it into the area.
Hazard was in front of the defence and finished with a left-footed shot that Alisson Becker, of Liverpool, could not stop.
Liverpool play Napoli on Wednesday 15:00 in the Champions League group stage. The match will be played at Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 BST in London.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's disaster agency at first light on Sunday.
Many people were trapped between the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves of up to six metres, according to Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, during a press briefing.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews, in John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area to report anything they have seen or heard to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would encourage anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street, in Birkenhead, and who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us."
I would also recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
Some people who believed they knew the woman arrived at the crime scene this afternoon to find out where she had been found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have informed the family of the victim that they are in the process of informing them.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his flat, but the police have told him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was left speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now being told that they will be allowed back in within a few hours.
Someone heard an agent telling a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was crying at the scene.
It keeps repeating "it's terrible".
At 2 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several officers were standing guard inside the cordon controlling the floor.
Any person with information is asked to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, registration number 247 dated 30 September.
The statue of Oliver Cromwell in Parliament Square is the latest commemorative success in "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects and sites in England carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's suggestions as "madness" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell from Westminster Palace would become a target."
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the Cromwell wrongly blamed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft Cromwell by Sir Thomas Brock is a testament to the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people see Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in this case, of course, the monarchy."
If it is a completely accurate description, then it is a matter for further debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
A Chinese pig farmer is attacked by a killer pig
A pig attacked and killed a livestock trader in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with an artery cut and covered in blood near a pigsty in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs at a pigsty in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
It seems that he travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood on its mouth in the pigsty.
The forensic examination confirmed that the pig had attacked the farmer until his death, according to the report.
The legs of his cousin were bloodied and mangled, he said, to The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found approximately one hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it attacking anyone else, while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, pigs have attacked people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared it away.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "disparator."
They are just playing.
They are like children, very curious - their intention is not to hurt.
What is needed is to treat them with the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters along the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa is expected to bring torrential rains to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States in the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa caused gusts of wind of more than 136 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, from Sunday morning (5 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) to Monday morning (Eastern Daylight Time), and was located about 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressure systems are starting to form in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward towards the West Coast of the United States.
Rosa is expected to leave more than 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, as the tropical rain hits the low pressure system that is approaching, widespread heavy rain is expected across the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimetres of rain will cause sudden flash floods, debris flows and possible rockfalls in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause flash floods of 5 to 8 inches per hour in specific areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in the greater part of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain, flash floods may occur suddenly with conditions that rapidly worsen.
Due to the threat of torrential tropical rains, it is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms could cause local winds and dust clouds.
Low pressure systems approaching the southern California coast will bring heavy rains to specific areas.
Heavy rains may leave as much as two centimetres of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
This would be the first heavy rain of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before widespread rain moves in late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will extend to the Four Corners on Tuesday and Wednesday.
In October, the United States will experience some intense temperature changes as the Arctic cools and the tropics warm.
Sometimes, this can mean drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences will be seen across the United States on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the long, hot summer will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected, with temperatures generally in the mid-20s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, New York could reach temperatures of up to 26 degrees, some 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term outlook indicates above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's appearance.
More than 20 million people followed the wrenching testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the policy remained stalled and the media interrupted their regular programming to broadcast the latest developments from Friday: a deal crafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had groped her while she was drunk at a high school party and had tried to take off her clothes.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was completely certain that that had not happened.
Nielsen estimated that more than 20.4 million people had seen it by Friday.
The company calculated the average audience for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels that retransmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems estimating how many people see something in the office.
For perspective, it is like a playoff or Oscar night audience.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led the cable leader with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers for a hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had $3.1 billion, NBC had $2.94 billion, MSNBC had $2.89 billion and CNN had $2.52 billion.
Following the appearance, there was continued interest.
Flake was the central character in the drama on Friday.
After the Republican moderate office issued a statement saying it would vote for Kavanaugh, the morning of Friday, CNN and CBS cameras captured protesters yelling at him as he tried to get into an elevator to attend a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
While receiving these criticisms, live on CNN, he appeared dejected.
A woman looked me in the face and said, "Looking me in the face."
"Are you telling the truth to the country?"
And he continued: "You have power when there are so many women who do not have it."
Flake said that his office had issued a press release and that he would have more to say before the doors closed on his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and broadcast television were airing it all live hours later, when the Senate Judiciary Committee had to vote to put Kavanaugh's nomination up for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate during the following week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was critical, as it became clear that Republicans would not have the votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of "playing politics"
Theresa May, the Prime Minister, accused her critics of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham (United Kingdom) on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the supposed Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to share customs duties was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde murder: Simpson arrested as suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Police have released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and say that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted shooting Wayde.
A $350,000 bond has been set, according to the defence.
The East Baton Rouge Parish District Court issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the fugitive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the police for their diligence and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was over 2 metres tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "in shock" by the death of Wayde.
Wade said: "These are the things that people always worry about."
A volcano in Mexico City spews ash
Ash from Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after it showed activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre recorded several tremors and shakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of vehicles in Mexico City neighbourhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, 72 km south-east of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The Don Goyo volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before independence referendum
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after protesters clashed with riot police during a demonstration by Catalan independence supporters, while tens of thousands of people took part in counter-demonstrations on the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan independence referendum.
A group of masked separatists who had been blocked by the riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also confrontations later in the evening and the police used batons to quell the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with slogans such as "Neither forget nor forgiveness", faced off against unionists shouting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but which separatists in Catalonia celebrate.
The voters chose independence by a majority vote, although turnout was low, as those who were against se boycotted the referendum in large numbers.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a police demonstration of support.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would become independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy at being able to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite winning a narrow victory in regional elections last December, the pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders, either in self-imposed exile or in jail, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone, said the conflict had been fanned by politicians on both sides.
He said: "It is getting tighter and tighter."
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since the end of last year, announced that he would be standing in the European Parliament elections next year.
Running for the European elections was the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the Spanish Government.
Londonderry: men arrested for crashing a car into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly driving a car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday evening at around 19:30 on Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there had been damage to the access and the building itself.
At some point, it is possible that the car was shot with a bow.
A Livingston victory over Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
A Livingston promoted to impress Rangers with his second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference. Gary Holt's side went up a place, with Hibs in second.
This season, Gerrard's team have yet to win away from home and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table by eight points.
Previously, Rangers played Rapid Vienna on a Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended its winning streak to six games in the division.
Livingston lets a visitor with a big stick get away
The Holt team should have gone a step ahead much earlier, causing all sorts of problems for Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defence but failed to score from in front of the goal. Alan Lithgow then shot wide after a deflection off Alan McManus after he had gone in to score from Craig Halkett's pass in front of the goal.
The host team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors with their ball-control play.
That was how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers gave them a free kick and Livingston looked for an opening, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the centre of the area.
At that point Rangers were in control of possession, but were unable to break down the host's defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was quite calm.
The game continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor turned away a Scott Pittman shot with a kick, and Livingston were unable to get close to another Lithgow effort.
There were long passes into the Livingston area constantly, but they were always cleared. Two penalty claims were rejected, one after a Halkett handball and the other after a Glenn Middleton replacement.
Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The consensus is that they played a great game that continued to exceed expectations on a rising trajectory.
Their style of play and their squad have barely changed since their rise, but this is largely down to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
It had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was huge and marshalled a superbly organised defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes at all times.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had some good times with Gerrard, they came up short.
They failed to materialize their plays, as they only managed to penetrate the opposition's field once, which is a warning to Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
Smiles and blue skies were on offer at breakfast for the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin on Saturday.
It is the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathisers turned up in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also voiced their condemnation of both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
These demonstrations reflect the divisive nature of this visitor, welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and regarded as an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at about 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by the paramedics, but died there and then.
The accident occurred after a cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that fled the scene on Childers Street, almost two kilometres from the site of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured in disturbances
Six prison officers have been injured in a fight in a high-security prison for men, according to the Directorate of the prison.
The disturbances started at HMP Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, at around 9:30 on Sunday and are still continuing.
A team of elite specialists (called "Tornado") is dealing with the disturbances, which involve eight inmates and affect a wing.
The agents received minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specialist staff from prisons have been deployed to deal with the incident at HMP Long Lartin."
Six members of staff have received medical assistance for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in jail.
Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner had attacked him.
In October last year, prison officers were requested to attend the prison to deal with a serious incident in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It is unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what could happen at the beginning of next week when the last remnants of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for the western Arizona, southern Nevada, eastern California and southern Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving behind rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina came within 65 kilometres of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 inches of torrential rain, which can reach 15 inches in isolated areas of the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Rainfall is likely to be between 2 and 5 mm, with the possibility of reaching 10 mm in isolated areas, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flash floods, Rosa's rains are considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, it is likely that some of these torrential rains will be beneficial due to the current drought conditions in the southwest.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering from extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will batter the Baja California peninsula.
Hurricane Rosa, which is expected to be a powerful hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 136 mph (219 km/h) on Sunday morning, is 619 miles (997 km) south-southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moving north at 19 mph (31 km/h).
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to hit Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at risk of flooding.
Heavy rains of between 7 and 15 centimetres are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimetres, as reported on weather.com.
Rosa will then head north towards Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression.
The main danger of Rosa or its remains is the torrential downpours in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest of the United States.
These rains are expected to cause sudden flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Four arrests for attempted murder in Midsomer Norton
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, at about 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he is "stable".
Three 17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area of Somerset that same night, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
Police have appealed to anyone who may have recorded the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the meanness and the anger of the Democratic Party"
Trump said voting for Kavanaugh was a vote to reject "the despicable and disgusting tactics of the Democrats."
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the meanness and the anger of the Democratic Party throughout the entire nomination process."
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this allegation.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, Americans saw "the cunning, the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our day, a lawyer with an admirable record of service to the public.
The President made indirect references to the Kavanaugh nomination in speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not running, but I am running a race,” he said.
That is why I go from one place to another fighting for big candidates.
Trump claimed that Democrats were on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
A senior Republican official told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people killed in a quake and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves that have been battering the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, as reported by authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday to celebrate a festival when waves of up to six metres high arrived in the evening, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When it was announced yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB, by its Indonesian acronym) in a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, and everything on land, said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved at a speed of 800 km/h across the open sea before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The replica was still hitting the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in a region with 2.4 million people.
The BPPT, in a statement, said the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
He said the geography of the city, which is built on the end of a long, narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings. In addition, 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage could be higher along the 300-kilometre stretch of coastline north of Palu, known as Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralysed and there was no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
The Red Cross said more than 300,000 people lived there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
That is a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse, he said.
On Saturday, the agency was criticised for not issuing a tsunami warning for Palu, although the authorities say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard warning people in the street below that a tsunami was approaching.
In just a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications in the surrounding area of Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has reopened only for emergency and rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a visit scheduled to the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is higher than 800.
It is very bad.
Although the staff of World Vision in Donggala had arrived safely in Palu, where their offices were being protected by tarpaulins erected in the garden of their offices, they had seen a devastating scene on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
He said he had been told that many houses had been destroyed.
It is very bad.
While the disaster-assistance gears were being put into motion, some people were complaining that the relocation of experienced personnel to Palu was being prevented.
According to Indonesian regulations, only foreign funding, supplies and personnel can be used in a disaster area if it has been declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross, said: "It is still a disaster at the provincial level."
As soon as the Government says it is a national disaster, we can start to provide international assistance, but it has not happened yet.
Friends and relatives of those still missing after the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palu were still hoping for a miracle that would bring some light to the stories of natural disasters.
A small child was rescued from a manhole on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to the body of her mother.
Gendon Subandono, national team parapente coach of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing parapenters for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the people trapped in the Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
He said: "I have my own emotional baggage when it comes to paragliding."
Mr Gendon recalled how, following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages only showed a grey verification mark, not two blue ones.
He said: "I think that means the messages were not delivered."
Thieves made off with $26,750 during a cash withdrawal at a Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, two robbers robbed a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM at Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM machine located in the centre of entertainment and was preparing to reload it with more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the note.
While he was busy, another man "ran up behind the Brink employee and stole a bag of money intended for recharging.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information about the identities of the deceased should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will now be known as Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time now, and he used that name as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album, Yandhi.
Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance due to "emotional reasons", as the creator of the programme commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance for him.
He said: "I think it's the most used word in the Bible, which means 'you'."
It means "I am you, you are me, we are one."
He went from being Kanye, which means "the only one", to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, Jay-Z, has used his name in capital letters or lower case, with or without a hyphen.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the newly elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population again, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that "he would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On 2 October 1968, the military fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when the left-wing student movements were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
President López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing them with monthly stipends for studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for I. A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after announcements by several parts of the U.S. Government, even though, in general, the United States lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 in innovation in I A. by 2030.
Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that other countries are lagging behind the United States, says Lee.
Double the funding means double the chances of the next great achievement in I. A. being achieved in the U. S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed a system that defeated the best American player of Othello. He later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google China.
He acknowledged the previous technological competitions of the United States Government, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get Government funding, Lee said.
Lee said: "It is not China that is taking the leaders away; it is the corporations."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired prominent university graduates to work in I.T.
He said that changes in US immigration policy could also help intensify US efforts in I. A.
I think that doctors in I. A. should be given permanent residency cards automatically, he said.
China's State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions as well as from government agencies, such as the National Science Foundation in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In early 2018, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, whose purpose is to attract partners from the industrial and academic sectors. The White House also announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a new initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in research on I. A.
Meanwhile, the United States' attempt to create a National Commission on Artificial Intelligence Security has not taken any action for months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their country should be renamed "Republic of Macedonia of the North", a move that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would diminish the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the required minimum 50 per cent turnout will be achieved.
The referendum ballot paper asked the following question: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to try to bring Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, into bodies like the EU and NATO.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopie, said: "I have come here today to vote for the future of my country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all."
Although it will not be legally binding, many members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote so that it is decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission declared at 1 p.m. that no irregularities had been reported.
However, voter turnout was only 16 % compared with 34 % in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 % of registered voters cast their votes.
Gjose Tanevski, 62, said: "I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe."
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in the referendum on changing the name of Macedonia in Strumica (Macedonia) on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopie, Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, was setting up a small stage and removing chairs from in front of the tents of those who were boycotting the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
The Prime Minister Zaev says that joining NATO would bring the investment that Macedonia so badly needs, whose unemployment rate is over 20 per cent.
I believe that the majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Mr. Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would be a "confirmation of our future".
A survey published by the Institute for Public Policy Research on Monday estimated that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum, which would be lower than the required turnout.
A poll conducted by Telma TV, in Macedonia, revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be at least 50 % plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western policy of the government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Sergio Agüero, of Manchester City, evades the entire Brighton defence to score a goal.
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling tore apart Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
Argentina's mediapunta received a pass in the middle of the first half.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking into open space.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He evaded a Brighton defender before beating several more in the Brighton area.
He made a left turn, where Sterling was.
England forward Harry Kane used his first touch to return the ball to Agüero, who struck it with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that hit the right post.
City manager Pep Guardiola said Aguero had some problems with his foot.
We are talking about 55 to 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave City the early advantage in the Premier League title race.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Aguero received the ball very deep inside the Brighton territory.
He made a lovely ball to the left side for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave Sterling a few taps before directing him towards the second pole.
The Sky blues' striker fired the ball into the net just before going offside.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. CET at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to spoil the Rockies' party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff race, there was no reason to force another opening.
Even so, the always competitive Scherzer is hoping to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Dodgers, who play in the National League West, have playoff chances still alive.
The Rockies at least secured a wildcard berth with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still chasing their first division title.
Although we are not playing for anything, at least we can step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and that the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I have faced this year.
Why wouldn't you want to?
The Nationals still have to announce a starter for Sunday, but it looks like they are leaning towards letting Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th appearance, had a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest day on Sunday.
Washington's left-hander has a record of 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 innings.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The President made indirect references to the Brett Kavanaugh situation in his remarks on the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
In November, everything we have done is at stake.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is one of the most important. I am not standing, but I am fighting for great candidates, so I go from one place to another.
And he continued: "We have this terrible radical group of democrats, they are in power right now."
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, and we see the meanness, the wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to step on to get power and control, that is what they want, power and control. And we are not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, were embarked on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
He said: "We have seen it these last four days. The Democrats are furious, they are bad, horrible and false."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, nominating Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was booed by the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, &quot; What? &quot;
No, no mmm, I hope for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I have ever seen.
The Labour Party has a wide range of views.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs to be told that I am not welcome, and only for saying what we think.
My colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment for her categorical opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censure motion criticised me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy in terms of national security for Europe. It is ironic that he was in disagreement with leaders on issues on which he had previously disagreed.
As was made clear at the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday, "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years that I have been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more friendly and compassionate" policy is long forgotten, if it ever was applied in the first place.
It is becoming clearer that Labour is intolerant of differing views and that each opinion is judged in terms of whether the party leadership considers it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom he had previously shared a political vision started to expect him to change his mind radically and adopt positions with which he had never been comfortable, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my resignation, denouncing the centre's policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced this.
Indeed, I am fortunate to be more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as my comments tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face daily torrents of sexist or racist abuse, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each censure motion or change in selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
Over the last two years, I have received many pieces of advice to keep my head down and not make too much noise, so that I would be "all right".
But I have not entered politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a schoolboy, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher Government which left my comprehensive school literally in ruins, I have tried to support improvements in public services for those who need them most, whether as a councillor or as a Minister in Government.
I have never hidden my political ideas, and I certainly did not do so in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions or areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who promoted the motion on Friday is that I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Momentum Nottingham, but for the voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will stop me from acting in the way I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: Ayr remain unbeaten at the top
Two late tries may have decided the final outcome, but without doubt Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They now lead the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence, as well as their ability to make better use of opportunities, which gave the local team the victory, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
He said: "We have been tested in all the games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy."
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: "Ayr deserves the recognition, they took the opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's try at the 14-minute mark, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, on loan to the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the opposition's disadvantage and Jason Baggot scored an unconverted try.
Ayr's advantage was extended by a penalty. Just before half-time, he scored and converted a try, leaving the score at 17-5 in favour of Ayr at the break.
However, the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's converted try by Baggot reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long delay after Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury, which had to be carried off on a stretcher, and the game resumed with Stafford McDowall's conversion for Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having one more man on the pitch for Bruce Colvine's last conversion attempt, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
However, the locals recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was shown a yellow card for placating Climo without the ball from the penalty spot, he made a try from the back of the maul that was advancing.
The weather converted him, as it had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry to the bottom corner for the fifth penalty kick.
The star of Still Game wants to steer his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, appears determined to move into the catering sector after being named the head of a chain of restaurants.
The actor Jack Jarvis, aged 56, is best known for his role as the hapless Mr. Wainwright in the BBC sitcom &quot;The Liver Birds&quot;, which he writes and co-stars in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth series will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the matter, although a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper claimed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "booming Glasgow restoration market".
Bolivia without a coastline has hope that the court will reopen the Pacific route
Naval headquarters are located in La Paz.
Blue flags wave in public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases show the motto: "The sea is ours by right."
It is a duty to recover it.”
In all of Bolivia, a land without a coast, people still vividly remember the lost coast of Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Bolivia may be hoping for a resolution from the International Court of Justice by 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and calm, and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's large screens spread throughout the country, hoping that the International Court of Justice in The Hague will rule in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous President Evo Morales, who is locked in a controversial battle over re-election next year, also has much to say about Monday's resolution.
He said in August that they were "very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favour and that the situation would not change much if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling came only six months after the final submissions indicated that the case was "not complicated", said Chilean expert Paz Zárate.
Far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have hampered it.
The Bolivian government had "seized" the issue of access to the sea, said Zárate.
He also suggested that Morales' bellicose rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talking, but it will be extremely difficult to keep the conversation going after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative to the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually swift.
Bolivia will be offered on Monday "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and to put an end to 139 years of mutual benefit disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political football.
Bolivia would never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The resolution is an opportunity to see what we need to leave behind.
North Korea says it will not give up its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never lead the way in nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made at a summit in Singapore between its rivals.
His comments come as Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy talks that have been stalled for more than three months since this summit with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.
Ri said that the continuation of the continued sanctions and the United States' opposition to a statement that would end the Korean War and submit the North was a "fantasy".
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration without some significant disarmament movement from Pyongyang first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's disarmament pledge, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is expected to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the leaders.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest huge hats about to land on a street near you
If you want to add to your collection of hats or protect yourself from the sun, you need look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a collection of eccentric hats for their spring/summer 2019 runway show in Paris, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide brim adorned with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other large accessories included pineapples, wizard hats and even pineapples, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn-on lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation resembled a full diving team, including snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice-cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you're in luck.
The big hat trendsetters predict that huge hats could start to appear on the streets of shops.
Big hats are coming in strong with "La Bomba" - a straw hat with a 60-centimetre wing used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The hat's maker, which flooded social media with the impractical creation, also presented another great creation on the runway: a beach bag as big as the model in the bikini that carried it.
The orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the main piece of Jacquemus' La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach bags and hats on the streets. Since the designer has had such an impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for big accessories."
John Edward: linguistic skills are fundamental for citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have a history of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the exams that is reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS, for its English initials), are striving to deliver the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare their pupils for further education, for the career they choose and for the place they will occupy as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages are still popular and desired in the centres.
As Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in his own language, you reach his heart."
If you speak to them in their language, it reaches their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that, if one wants to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, English alone is not enough.
If we look at the recent results of this year's language tests, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest rates of success in independent schools.
Overall, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received an A, the highest grade.
Data from the 74 centres that make up the SCIS showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a fundamental skill that children and young people will need for sure in the future.
Languages are now considered to be on a par with the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the independent school curriculum and everywhere else.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that, of the reasons given by employers for difficulties in filling jobs, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential for preparing young people for their future careers.
The increasing demand for language skills in the workplace means that these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to this kind of competition, which will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will give that person an automatic advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation.
For this reason, investing in language education is important for children today.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be better equipped to find a quality job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more traditional modern languages, while others will teach the more important languages for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever a child's interests, in independent schools he or she can choose between a range of languages taught by specialist staff.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
It is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages are "competencies for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Well, you have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron James makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans hoping to see LeBron James make his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the Lakers' season-opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the length of the game is yet to be determined.
Walton said on the Lakers' official website that it would be "more than one and less than 48."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
At this stage of his career, he does not need pre-season friendlies to prepare for matches.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump campaign events scheduled for next week, including stops in places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress if the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch it live on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will comment on this week's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's testimony, which was marred by sexual misconduct allegations and has left the Senate waiting for an early vote on confirmation, which could take a week at most while the FBI investigates.
However, the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans facing the November elections to gain momentum.
Thus, the Trump campaign's five rallies next week are meant to "energize volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House," according to Reuters.
The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that Trump will travel to as many states as possible while campaigning, a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, but declined to give his name.
The rally scheduled for tonight at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract sympathizers from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media coverage in Pittsburgh, as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the Senate in West Virginia, who is falling behind in the polls.
For Morrisey, it was not a good sign that the president had to come to push him in the polls, according to Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, as reported by Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the United States team shows that it is willing to fight to keep the hope of individual matches alive on Sunday.
After three individual sessions, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing is a completely invented concept in sport, but players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like this.
So where is the impetus now?
We were six points ahead and now they are four points ahead, so I guess that is a little bit of a push,
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with 12 more on the line.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have something of a tailwind and plenty of reasons to be optimistic, among other reasons because of the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and earned four points together.
Spieth has been lethal off the tee and on the green, and preaches by example.
The guttural roars of celebration grew louder as the round progressed, introducing a vital putt for Thomas and him to tie the fourth round when they were two down after two holes.
The putt that gave the Americans the lead in the 15th was greeted with a similar roar, one that suggested that the Americans were not yet out of the game.
What is needed is to redouble efforts and focus on the game, according to Spieth.
That is what these players have done.
18 holes today.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
The odd and adorable couple of Europe have four of a kind and nothing can go wrong.
Woods and Woods were the only pair to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the last nine holes of Friday morning.
That run and the way it flows with the noisy crowd on Sunday leave no doubt that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, two holes in different locations.
However, it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning, after teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two birdies on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not escape.
But there will be no help on Sunday to get out of the holes.
The foursomes and fourballs are fascinating to watch because you see the interplay between the couples, the advice they give and the advice they don't, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead going into the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the United States team is willing to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two wins over Tiger Woods, who was in trouble, four points ahead in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to retain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a US team that made many errors during the foursomes in the morning, which ended 3-1.
The United States won two foursomes matches, but failed to close the gap.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, who were dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the foursomes, their magnificent partnership helped them to beat a dejected Woods and a rookie American Bryson DeChambeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who had not shone too brightly in the two Saturday matches, had occasional flashes of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned with Henrik Stenson to win the foursomes against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and number three players respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the weather was pleasant and calm in the southwest of Paris, Europe was not having all its own way.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three times, served as role models for the Americans, who earned two points on Saturday.
They secured a thrilling 2-1 victory in the fourballs against Ian Poulter and Jon Rahm and then beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has recovered from a four-point deficit in the individual matches only twice, but Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a tie to retain it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that a comeback on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament unless it has confidence.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his country's mistrust of the United States and that there was no possibility of his country unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho, the head of the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency, told the General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken "important steps of goodwill" in the past year, including halting nuclear tests and missile launches, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.
However, we have not received a similar response from the United States.
If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot have confidence in our national security, and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility of unilateral disarmament.
Although Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes steps, his statement is important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization outright, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump after the first summit between an American president in office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to working towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons before it can give up its arms.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States had insisted on nuclear disarmament first and had increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal coercively, even objecting to a declaration of the end of war, Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can make us fall to our knees is a fantasy of people who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.
Ri did not mention any plans for a second Trump-Kim summit, announced with a bang and a whimper by the US leader at the United Nations at the start of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of the Republic of Korea, in the last five months, and added: "If the Republic of Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, Mr Ri's tone was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that missiles fired by North Korea would land on American soil after "malignant president" Trump called Kim Jong-un "rocket man".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said there was still much to do and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this: "We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward North Korea for its advances.
However, as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, "The sanctions regime of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without deviation until we realize a fully verifiable and irreversible denuclearization."
The Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006, in an attempt to cut off funding for its ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea had denounced its "demands as those of a gangster".
North Korea agreed to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures", according to a statement from the North Korean Foreign Ministry.
He said Kim had told him that the "measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all students are now sleeping more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of all-night studying fuelled by caffeine.
A professor at the world's number one university discovered that students there often had no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk on how sleep deprivation affects learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked why she was just finding out about this now, in her last year.
He said that no one had ever spoken to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was delivered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were sleeping only during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that students are not going to change their behaviour immediately.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as any person has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of pride in "staying up all night" still existed and added that modern technology and the pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and a good quality of sleep should be "the secret weapon" of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation makes the brain feel hungry, so students want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the whole campus.
She hopes the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar programme of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler's recommendation is that students set an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the negative effects of blue light emitted by computer screens and LED lights, which can alter circadian rhythms, so that they will have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal sinks Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another away-day depression when the defeat by Dolly Menga saw Steven Gerrard's disjointed team lose 1-0 at Livingston.
Rangers wanted to record their first away win since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone but Gary Holt's team beat them for the second time in 18 games as manager, leaving them eight points behind Hearts, who are now Premiership leaders.
Menga's attack came just minutes before half-time and Rangers' lacklustre alignment was never going to be enough.
Now Rangers are in sixth place, Livingston in third, behind Hibs by the difference in goals.
The Rangers may have more problems, as referee Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance after allegedly being hit by an object from the visiting stand.
Gerrard changed eight of the players who won the match against Ayr, reaching the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt, meanwhile, took the 11 Livingston players who drew with Hearts last week and would have been pleased with the way his organised team had dominated their opponents throughout.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston made better use of the ball when they had it.
They should have been awarded at two minutes into the game when Menga made a pass to Scott Pittman that went between the defence, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs made a try from the deep for captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only kick it out on the long side.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their play in the third period.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalised in the 15th minute of the game when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian appeals.
Rangers had two goals from open play in the first half, but former Ibrox keeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame effort.
Although Livingston's goal in the 34th minute was against all the odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in.
Again, Rangers could not cope with a deep ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga to score.
In the break, Gerard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as Morelos was able to pass to Kelly, but the impressive Kelly came out of his line to block him.
Even so, Livingston continued to take his visitors exactly where he wanted them, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing the way with long passes.
Holt's men may have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor held firm to deny Jacobs before Lithgow finished off a header that did not go in.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty in the dying seconds of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and counting...
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that culminated in the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Singing Hills", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans playing the roles of apparently incompatible cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium."
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a common protein in many cancers and re-inject it.
A promising trial of a vaccine is underway for patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein called HER2 in many cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes growth of different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancerous cells has been used in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West embarked on a rant in favour of Trump with a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after a performance that was erratic and at times incoherent, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the hat with the message Make America Great Again, he started to rant against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often speak to someone white and they ask me how I can like Trump if he is racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in relation to the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted the rant on social media.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
West also told the audience that he had had a hard time on stage wearing the hat.
They messed with me.
They told me not to wear my hat.
They got me!
And then they tell me I am asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see me asleep?" and added that he was "going to put on his cape of superman, because that meant that no one could tell him what to do. Do you want the world to advance?"
Try with love.”
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died recently.
West confounded many when he came on stage dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING THE MASSES."
Karen Hunter, a TV presenter, tweeted that West was "just being himself and that is absolutely wonderful".
But I choose not to reward someone (buying their music or clothes, or supporting their art) whom I believe is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology in my community.
He is free.
We also”, he added.
Before the programme, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
It is not the first artist to change his name, following the footsteps of Puff Daddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been known as Snoop Lion, without forgetting the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the Police.
The accused is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Kit Harington, star of Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
The actor, 31, has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those roles on screen often told young boys they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something had gone wrong" and questioned how to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit Harington, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he thought it was "fairly important" to address the issue.
I think it is quite important at this moment, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?
What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems we see now?
Kit believes that television may have a part to play in the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued: "What is innate and what is taught?"
What is taught on television and in the street that makes young men feel they have to be this particular kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of our time: how do we change?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any Game of Thrones spin-offs when the series ends next summer, saying he was "tired of battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard's play about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
He recently revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he has taken away from Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, I have given my future family and my life from now on.
Rose, who played Ygritte, Jon Snow's love interest in the fantasy series, won an Emmy for her role.
The couple married in June 2018 at a farm in Scotland belonging to Leslie's family.
China reports 14 per cent more new HIV/AIDS cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of these cases were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way has fallen in total, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community faces much discrimination.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 % and 90 % of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of appropriate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data on Republican senators and says it is "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized the allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about legislators.
The Democratic mayor of Los Angeles said the allegations were being driven by right-wing commentators and websites.
Waters tweeted: "Lies, lies and more lies."
The information published allegedly included the addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person posted information on the Internet during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of the publications was associated with Waters' office, and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
Mr. Waters said the allegations were "completely unfounded and an absolute lie."
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a complete lie.
Waters' statement was immediately met with criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote: "This information is false and I am angry about it."
This suggests that the necessary temperance to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not get angry.
Do not rebel.
The accused should not be questioned on the motives.
He must remain calm and serene.
It seems that Fleischer was trying to compare Waters' reaction to the Kavanaugh hearing with the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who they accused of seeming too angry during his testimony on Thursday.
Republican Omar Navarro, who is running against Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
He said: "If that is true, that is very serious."
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted "relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent allegations".
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions against all my staff.
Johnny English: Back in Action. Rowan Atkinson's spy spoof is short of its mark
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit gags in any new British film. It seems to be what is required of this new Johnny English parody action and comedy franchise, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satire about how clearly ridiculous we are the new export opportunity for the nation?
Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and expressionless face, has been given a licence to cock things up for the second time. His name alone gives clues that this is a comedy aimed at English-speaking territories.
Of course, it is the ridiculous secret agent, despite his strange claims to waste glamour, who has a little of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a hint of that type who touched only one note in the Carros de fuego ceremony at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It was also based on the mysterious man traveller and international figure that Atkinson had represented years ago in the forgotten Barclaycard television adverts, leaving chaos in his wake.
In this last delivery, there are a couple of good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armour as the rotors hit the hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but the humour is somewhat lacking and is particularly superfluous now that franchises such as 007 and Mission: Impossible are adding comic ingredients without problems.
The humour seems more aimed at children than adults, and for me, the silly adventures of Johnny English are not as clever and funny as the silent jokes of Atkinson in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated argument of the day is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the consternation of the agent on duty, Kevin Eldon.
It is the straw that breaks the camel's back for the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered character who is seeing her popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this role, which is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room for working.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are at risk, he will have to rely on one who is retired.
That must be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a posh school, though he also teaches secret agent skills on the side: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy school like the one in School of Rock.
English is moved to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and meets his old friend Bough, now represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married submariner with a captain's hat, a role he doesn't exploit enough with Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the terrible Batman and Robin from the Secret Service of Her Majesty return to action, with the beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the clutches of a charismatic billionaire from the world of technology who claims he can solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to a fancy French restaurant, cause chaos by hiding on the luxurious yacht of Volta; English also becomes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta's house.
The final sequence was definitely used to the full, but, however graceful and noisy it may be, the whole still conveys a sense of childishness.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder whether the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan to make Britons work four days a week and be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week, but receiving five days' pay.
The party reportedly wants the owners of companies to use the savings from the AI revolution to give their workers an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "fits" into the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country towards workers.
This change to a four-day week has received the support of Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party figure told The Sunday Times: A review of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
The four-day working week is a long-term goal that the party hopes to achieve, as well as a strategy for industrial policy in general.
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such ideas, as the Green Party had already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, not all Labour Party members are in favour of this decision at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and is not going to be discussed at this stage."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to outline his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was prepared to recover powers from "anonymous directors" and "well-heeled" directors of public service companies.
One of the shadow minister's plans also includes the idea that the current shareholders in water companies will not get back all their investment, as a Labour government could apply deductions to reflect the irregularities.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers on boards of companies and to create inclusive property funds, with 10 per cent of shares in private sector companies going to employees, which would yield annual dividends of up to £500.
Senators Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk to 60 Minutes about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has at least delayed for a week the final vote on his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice, and raised the question of whether the results could influence any Republican senator who decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could change their minds.
Senator Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
I was in favour of going ahead with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this had happened, after the claim had been made and I asked him: "Did you do it?"
He was firm, resolute, and determined.
Graham's vote, however, appears to be immovable.
He had already made up his mind about Brett Kavanaugh and would ignore the allegations.
Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it tersely, Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she names has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It is always the same, I see nothing new in this case."
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival where an impressive lineup of stars come together for a mission just as impressive: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park's Great Lawn to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be informed about the real purpose of the event: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that aims to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
If you wish to receive a free entry to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert-goers have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity that serves to raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved in 12 years?
Is the idea of a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or not, or is it just another form of "clicktivism", which is the name given to the position we take when we believe we are doing something really useful by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million actions by its supporters in favour of a wide range of goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have secured commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly affected almost 649 million people around the world.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based investor and implementer association, which is working with the common commitment "to help children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, $35 million has been proposed to help Rwanda end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens' partners.
Thanks to the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and partners like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of "The Power of Nutrition", to the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after having carried out more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced the funding of a project, Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequent questions asked on their website about what we think can be done to address extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator responded: "It will be a long and hard road, and we will stumble and fall along the way."
But, as we have already achieved with the movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will achieve our goals because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the acts we will have at the New York event this year, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out the energy export blockade of Russia - Department of the Interior
In case necessary, Washington could call on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking up the markets, including the Middle East, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates on behalf of the legitimate government, is just a pretext for expansion into new markets.
I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier of Europe.
Official information also indicates that there are ways and means of dealing with this issue.
The United States, with its Navy, has the capacity to ensure that maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the consumer voice in energy in the United States."
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington takes in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is, essentially, to exploit and replace fossil fuels, he said, adding that Russia only knows one thing, and that is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made as the Trump administration has been trying to push liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unacceptable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will turn Berlin into a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted throughout that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is valued at $11 billion and is intended to double the current gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin defends that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only economic and is another example of unfair competition.
I believe that we all share the idea that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The United States has found itself, however, with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
It is a major problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, will "thoroughly" consider running for president in 2020, she said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being considered.
It is time for women to come to Washington to fix our fractured government and finally have women among our leaders, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider the possibility of standing for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a visit to the City Hall and said he was "taking the country down the wrong path."
He said: "I really worry about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy."
Warren spoke openly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from Friday, Warren said "it is absolutely necessary that the FBI investigate what happened before the vote."
A survey was published on Thursday, however, a majority of Warren's own voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58 per cent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said that Senator Kerry should not run for President.
32 per cent of respondents supported his candidacy.
In the survey, former Governor Deval Patrick was supported by 38 per cent of respondents and opposed by 48 per cent.
Other Democratic Party members spoke about the possible candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the 2020 presidential election.
Biden said he would make a decision in January, as reported by Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder in Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
The situation that my son is going through, everything that has happened since he came back, they know very well the other families that are suffering the effects of TEPT and other wounds that our soldiers return with, " she said to the crowd that gathered at a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the "big taboo nobody wants to talk about", and commented on his son and other veterans of war that "they come back with a different attitude, hardened, wondering whether there is really that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all the other members of the armed forces, have given to their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence, which interfered with a domestic violence complaint and possession of firearms under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to develop a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit challenging the new US policy that denies asylum to domestic violence victims or gang members.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia submitted a "friendly" letter on Friday in Washington to show their support for a current asylum seeker who is facing the current directive, according to NBC News.
The name of the plaintiff in the case "Grace v. Sessions" brought by the ACLU in August 2013 against the federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner and his children, who were members of a violent gang, abused her, but US officials denied his asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers representing these states, which defend Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries facing widespread domestic violence and gang problems.
The new asylum policy of the United States reversed a 2014 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented domestic violence victims to seek asylum in this country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine made comments on Friday in which he said the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
According to federal asylum law, all asylum applications must be rejected on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the individual case and this exception violates that principle, the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also wrote that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the economy of the United States by asserting that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "are a necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to domestic abuse and gang violence victims in June.
Asylum seekers can apply for asylum if they leave their country of origin because of persecution or threats on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said when he announced this directive on 11 June.
Asylum was never created as a panacea to deal with all the problems, even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming ever more dire.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, was trying to comfort her feverish baby at a shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for the few belongings they have left in an effort to recover what they can.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside the building due to the continuing aftershocks, which were also very strong.
He could not help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he had experienced while staying on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to get out of the way.
I was trapped in the rubble of the collapsed wall, he told Associated Press. He and his family were in the city to celebrate a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help and then a terrible silence.
I don't know what has happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you are well.
The US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper touting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the United States ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register, the most widely circulated newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 elections in the United States, something China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence US elections marked a new phase in a growing US campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publicize their commercial activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led both sides to raise tariff levels on imports from each other.
China's countervailing duties that were in place at the start of the trade war were designed to fall on exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Donald Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest agricultural exporters to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and business people.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China is "intensifying that pressure even more with advertisements in our free press."
The Chinese government is using the cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and a free press to try to place an ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
Instead, in the newsstand on the street where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few voices of dissent and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China can have on the worrying trajectory that their economy is taking, because the media are controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China had declined to publish" his article, but did not specify which newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh debacle
As many prominent Republicans are closing ranks behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a backlash could occur, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been intense and many Republicans have said they want to move forward with the vote.
Grant Reeher, a political scientist at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill on Saturday that "you can't go back" on such issues.
Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) said he doubted that the last attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to position himself in favour of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters who were upset about this issue.
Women "are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget tomorrow, and they are not going to forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, the protesters who gathered outside the Senate were singing "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) as the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by the Mic.
Democrats "are just bursting with enthusiasm and motivation," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, at the site of news.
People say that the impact is already very significant, and indeed it is.
But it could be even greater, especially among the indecisive voters in the outer suburbs and the younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not usually vote but do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony in which he detailed his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had indicated that a backslide could occur if Republicans continued ahead with the confirmation.
Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele said the issue had become a "big mess" for the Republican Party, according to NBC News, which reported on 9 September.
It is not just a question of the committee vote and the final vote, or even whether Kavanaugh sits on the bench; it is also about how Republicans have handled all of this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know whom to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, although a few more are now on Kavanaugh's side.
In a new YouGov poll, 41 per cent of respondents said they believed Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while 30 per cent said the same of Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her when she was 17 while drunk.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering starting a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the technology legend. A company based on the open source platform of the Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "to dominate the world."
He said, "It has to be now."
It is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create their own "online data storage locker" or POD.
It can contain lists, lists of tasks pending, the music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
Something that is unique to online personal data storage is that the user is the one who decides completely who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal data training".
According to the company's director general, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to integrate resources, processes and skills to enable Solid to reach the world.
At present, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the developers on the payroll working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team was not talking to Facebook and Google about whether a radical change was going to be introduced or not, where all their business models were going to be completely changed from one day to the next.
We are not going to ask for permission.
Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has had a very influential role in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even though Berners-Lee is stepping down from the W3C, he will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee said he was "incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web".
Bernard Vann: the vicar who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War
The only English clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War has been honoured 100 years after his birth in his home town.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this decoration on 29 September 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a marksman killed him four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "a very symbolic thing" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned his grandfather the medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under intense machine-gun and artillery fire".
He then ran towards the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", pushed the line forward before reaching a single-tracked trench and knocking out three of the enemy.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just one month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so big that I will never reach his level, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, which featured the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade and added that the value of a true hero was clear when so many people were supporting him.
MMA fans stayed up all night for Bellator 206, but all they saw was Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 and then they don't let you see the main event.
The San José poster featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main card, and it was going to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in the UK at night.
At 6 a.m. -- just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off -- the UK viewers were left stunned when the programme changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay up until the early hours of the morning just to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to animated cartoons as "a heavy joke".
There is government regulation on what can be broadcast after 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to change to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the pig", yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would be changing the format to include British viewers in the next editions.
When I think about the option of a live broadcast, I think it can work," said Coker.
But it is 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we could not do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We are working on it.
I can tell you that when the schedule changed, we received a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We are trying to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was a government problem.
I can promise you that it will not happen again.
We will reduce the number of fights from six to five, which is what we normally do. We try to give more than usual so that the fans are happy and we go over.
It is a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior because of his sexuality, but this was what drove him to become a winner.
At 24, she told us that she did not realise that not everyone was like her until she went to secondary school.
In the first Desert Island Discs programme on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in talking about gay rights was to "transmit hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to put less emphasis on winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of this mythical programme, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In the first Laverne and Daley programme, Daley, who had been marginalised, commented that he had felt inferior to others during his childhood because "it was not socially acceptable to like children and girls".
She said: "Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what has really given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-medal Olympic bronze medallist has become a prominent figure in the LGBT movement and his image has been used in the Commonwealth Games held in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he told his story because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass on that "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that for her too, falling in love with a man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, was a surprise.
Daley married last year the Oscar-winning actor who is 20 years his senior, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
When you live so much from such a young age (she was 14 when she first went to the Olympics and her father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone your age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global perspective" had changed.
If asked last year, all the answers would have been about "I have to win a gold medal", he said.
But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for the London 2012 Olympics, because he wanted to be in the front row.
He said: "I couldn't tell him I couldn't be in the front row."
She said: "I had his hand in mine when he stopped breathing and it was only at that precise moment that I realised that he was not invincible."
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of my family at the Olympics, there was nothing better.
This was also the inspiration behind his first song choice, Proud, by Heather Small, which accompanied him during the build-up to the Olympic Games.

Mickelson, in poor form, was on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to avoid becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who was playing in the biennial event to try to break his record for 12th time, was beaten by Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the centre of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time major champion had to cheer on his team at times and, at others, try to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to correct what was troubling him.
The 48-year-old player is not in his best form for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough punishes errant shots.
And if the field is not already daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth round of Sunday's play, faces the brilliant champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points behind at the start of the 12 individual matches, had started in such an impressive fashion, Mickelson's match could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, but could not say much more.
He understood perfectly the role he plays today, gave me a pat on the back and said he would be ready for tomorrow."
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined playing two games.
I thought there would be more, but that is how it came out and that is how we think it should be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of us.
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last of a Ryder Cup career that had never been so clearly defined by his individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, but Furyk said his presence added many more intangible values to the team.
He said: "It's fun, sarcastic, clever, he likes to mock others; he's a great guy to have in the team."
I think the younger players have enjoyed having him as a support this week; it was fun.
It is more than just playing.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, even with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a Seve Ballesteros-led European team had a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end only managed to finish them off by a minimum margin, winning 14½-13½.
Bjorn, who was pictured after the 2018 team won 5-3 on Friday and led by 10-6 yesterday at Le Golf National, said: "We keep reminding you that we won a great tournament at Valderrama, we also won at Brookline and lost, we won at Valderrama and lost, but by a whisker."
History will teach me and the world that this team is not finished.
You have to give it everything tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the board.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to think about.
I say this all the time, but we are very aware of what is on the other side of the pitch where our players are, and that is the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players had achieved on a very hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to go ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual action and that is different.
It is great to share what is happening when things are going well, but when things are not going well, you really test your golfing ability.
The message to be conveyed to players is to give their best tomorrow.
Now it is time to leave your partner behind and go and get the best out of yourself.
Facing Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will be hoping his players can do better individually than as a pair, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points from four.
Furyk has been on both ends of these big tournaments in the last few days and has been part of the winning team at Brookline and then lost when Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah".
He remembered every word when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had motivated his players on the last day.
We have 12 super-importants tomorrow, but we have to play as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in the same direction, the pressure falls on those middle parties.
We defined our strategy and made them feel that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main event, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the whole route," Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to defective systems and the increasing costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a report in the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but problems that arose after delivery scuppered the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and a few technologies of invisibility, such as radar, infrared and acoustic signatures that are very reduced.
Among other important features are longer maintenance periods, allowing deployment for up to two years away from the home port.
However, the constant delays have meant that the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power into the oceans) will already be outdated when they start to serve, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was handed over to the German Navy last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a ship has been returned to a shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half the crew of the old Bremen class ships.
It was also found that the ship has an excessive weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as other similar ships that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the overall project cost, including training of the crew, has also been a problem.
It is now estimated to be worth €3,100 million (US$3,600 million), rather than the initial €2,200 million.
The problems being attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction in the naval power of Germany.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the Navy was "running short of ships capable of deploying".
The official said the problem had been getting worse over time, because old ships had been decommissioned but not replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret lives of bats
This new research, carried out in a Highland area of Scotland, is trying to find out how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that what is learned will shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and soprano pipistrelle bats, as well as Daubenton's bat and brown long-eared bats in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special bat detectors will be placed strategically on the property to track bat activity during the season.
The NHS volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using hand-held detectors.
Experts will analyse the sounds picked up on the recordings to discover the frequency of calls from bats and what species make them.
A habitat report and map will then be produced to provide a detailed picture of the environment and its behaviour.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, is hoping the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be managed for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development that affect their nests and habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical cabling can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticides and other chemical treatments of construction materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
Unless they are nocturnal hunters, their ears are more useful than their eyes in achieving their goal.
They use a sophisticated technique of ecolocation to locate ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescues.
The organisation has even opened the first and only Scottish bat reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
Here at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many veteran trees and the right habitat.
However, there are still many unknowns about bats, so the work we are doing here and on other properties will help us to understand better what they need to develop.
It highlights the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance work on properties, as it is possible to destroy a breeding colony unintentionally and 400 females and young could be killed, which would wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Wildlife Trust's bat officer, has encouraged the public to get involved.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species on which we do not know how their populations evolve."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations as "fake news", and said people were "trying to get their name out there" at his expense.
His lawyers have been instructed to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, where the statements were published.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping a woman from the United States, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of having been paid 375,000 dollars to cover up the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video on Instagram Live that has already amassed 142 million followers just hours after the news was released, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false", says five-time Olympic gold medallist looking at the camera.
They just want publicity at my expense.
It is the same old story.
They want to be famous just by mentioning me, but I can't help it.
The player smiled and added, "I am a happy man and everything is fine."
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations in the report, which they have called "un unacceptable intrusion into the sphere of privacy", according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, the player's lawyer, said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years."
According to reports, the incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to Ronaldo's room and he allegedly raped her anally, according to the documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo had knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good boy" and that he had let him down by the "one per cent" remaining.
In the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and that photographs were taken of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being humiliated in public.
The woman, aged 34, says she is trying to annul the agreement, as she is still traumatised by the events.
When the alleged assault took place, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has moved to Juventus, a big name in Italian football on a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: the UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "regret it for the rest of our lives" if we lost our position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Greg Clark.
He said it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that, if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at its Burnaston factory near Derby would be temporarily halted.
Mr Clark said: "We need an agreement."
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of Brexit-related delays at customs could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 per cent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain leaves the EU in March, there will be production shortfalls in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, the general manager of Toyota Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade; among them, Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW has said it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the problems that could arise in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is based on the "just in time" method, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to build cars to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border, according to the sector, which could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota said it would be impossible to house the equivalent of a day's inventory in its Derbyshire plant and production would be halted if that happened.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan, which sets out future relations with the EU, was "tuned precisely to avoid those controls at the border".
We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will not only see us through this moment but will allow us to take advantage of the opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
Toyota's evidence is that we can continue with what has been a tremendously successful supply chain so far.
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long term the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the plant for 24 years and is the Unite union representative there, said members were becoming increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a clear and convincing plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
The high-risk meeting between President Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be delayed another week, the White House said Sunday, as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continued.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, connections between Trump and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation that Trump would fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus compromise the independence of Mueller, has fed the gossip in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had recorded his conversations with Trump with a microphone that he himself carried to try to get rid of the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House, where news reports said he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was then in New York at the United Nations) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not to" fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, which would delay the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed, considering all that is happening with the Supreme Court."
We will decide on the spot and I will inform the press as I usually do.
Some journalists would dispute that assertion: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the lack of press availability was not because of a dislike of TV reporters who act grandiloquently, although he said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they fanfaronade."
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any other President before him, he said, citing "unsubstantiated numbers" without providing any evidence.
Press briefings will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option of asking directly the President of the United States, I think that is much better than asking me."
We have tried to do this many times and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public events or press briefings with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him are very rare.
Indeed, this week, in New York, the President demonstrated why he was so popular, where he made an uncharacteristically relaxed and, at times, bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
The Scottish Government Health Secretary writes to NHS Scotland staff about their fears over Brexit
The Scottish Government Health and Social Care Partnership has written to the EU staff working in the Scottish Health and Social Care Partnership to express gratitude for their work and to ask them to continue working with them after Brexit.
MSP Jeane Freeman sent a letter just six months before the UK was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU citizens working in non-central government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario in which there is no agreement.
I know that all this must be very confusing for you.
And that is why I would like to repeat how much I value the contribution of each and every member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
EU and other professionals bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count on you.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing urgent surgery after suffering a head wound
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday, when the Tigers lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
He said: "He came to the band and collapsed there and then."
Both the coaches and the medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touchline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A member of the staff at the Tennessee State Fair told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no details about the type of injury or the damage caused, and the Tennessee State was trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, adding up to 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the extra money raised will be used to provide shelter for the homeless, according to new plans by the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's offensive to attract younger voters.
The increase in the land transaction tax will be applied to those who are not paying taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to be spent on the homeless.
The additional money raised from the increase in stamp duty for overseas buyers of property in the UK will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The measure is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn is enjoying with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger voters and to target those with higher incomes.
The increase in the land transaction tax will be levied on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and that money will be used to incentivise the government's policy to combat begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is an additional levy on top of the current stamp duty, could rise to as much as 3 per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year from this change.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new-build properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, which is causing house prices to rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas (especially the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of keeping property prices high by buying land without any intention of using it and urged Mrs May to abolish the charges that apply to affordable homes to solve the "shameful problem of housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to no-fault evictions.
It also proposes giving local authorities more powers to build new homes.
The Prime Minister said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation."
That means solving the housing market, which is so badly damaged.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of owning a home has become too difficult for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My primary objective is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland manager says his "primary objective" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited at the prospect of reviving the north-east club, which currently occupies third place in League One (the third tier of English football), three points behind the top team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back into the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I could only get a B hat from Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my dad and it has always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I can successfully run a club.
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sunderland manager are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he did not feel any fear when moving to such established names in a club as big as this, after rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success is measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club clearly correspond to those of the Premier League," he said.
It is not easy to achieve, but I would only consider that I had achieved my goal here when I could return the club to where it belongs.
Ross has been a coach for just three years after being an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell in the Hearts technical department.
He helped St. Mirren recover from relegation to the Third Division and helped St. Johnstone win the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled that "it was a real crossroads" when he took over the Alloa.
I always thought that coaching was what I was best at, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, but it was good, I could make a living from it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face many things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work, but I feel good in my role.
I always wanted to train and now I have, this is the time of my adult life when I have felt best, without a doubt.
The full interview will be available on Sportsound on Monday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The heatwave of summer has boosted profits for British pubs fighting to survive, but has concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have kept the pattern of the previous month of June, when pubs increased 2.8 per cent on their takings, while restaurants have fallen even more.
The 1.8 per cent fall in restaurant trade in June was even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly serve drinks had their strongest month, compared with most restaurants, where they made less profit.
Pub operators, who mainly serve food, also suffered, although not as badly as restaurant operators.
It seems that people only want to go out to drink.
In managed bars and pubs, sales of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent during the month, while food sales fell by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, head of leisure and hospitality at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April."
The time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still fighting, even though the 4.8 per cent fall in sales compared with last year is going to be particularly painful given the continuing pressure on costs.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators and the weather will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand openings.
In Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, data is collected and analysed for 47 operational groups, with combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the market reference point.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents' backs
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts that their parents and teachers do not know about, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rise in fake Instagram pages.
News has sharpened fears that sexually explicit material will be published
20 per cent of students said they had a "main" account that showed their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) have created secret social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a site for sharing photos.
News reports have sharpened fears that sexually explicit material will be published.
20 per cent of students said they had a "main" account that showed their parents, while also having other private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter's secret site saw a teenager encouraging others to "violate" her.
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: "It is alarming that so many young people feel the need to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on both track and field and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want to see sport benefit from its great international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the Scottish athletics community, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from her involvement in its leadership," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I like to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help develop sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics between the four golds he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I suffered a stroke.
He could not walk.
According to the doctors, only time would tell whether I would recover or how much I would recover.
It has been exhausting, but I have recovered completely and am now doing agility exercises.

The announcement of the breast pump where mothers are compared to cows has divided opinion on the Internet
A baby-milk-bottle-cleaning company has divided opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares mothers who breastfeed with cows that are being milked.
To mark the launch of what is supposedly the "world's first silent breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie published an ad inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music that shows mothers talking about the freedom they get from the new breast pump.
Four real women dance in a barn full of hay as a dance floor, along with cows, with signs such as: "Yes, I do it myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Just in case you haven't noticed, they are not udders, they are my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Feed them, feed them, I am feeding their babies, feed them, feed them, I am feeding my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused a great deal of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, with many saying that it puts the spotlight on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to produce milk, except that they take their babies away from them just after giving birth.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby."
But why not use them to announce a breast pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a ridiculous advertisement."
However, other people defended the advert, including a woman who admitted that the song was "destructive".
I think that is a great idea.
If it was still suckling, it would definitely have one.
Using the pump, I felt like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit over the top, but I am not going to dwell on it.
It was a great product, a woman told us.
Another person commented: "It is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows."
The dairy industry is not praised or criticised in the advertisement.
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the discreet pumps placed inside the bras.
The campaign concept is based on the perception that many women who express milk with a pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly attached to a nursing bra, which allows its users to move, hold their babies and even go out with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother's social and ECD, tells us: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch."
By showing the parallel between expressive women and lactating cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while also demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that comes with the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children walked the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of unaccompanied minors discreetly relocated to a camp on the Texas border
The number of unaccompanied minors apprehended has increased significantly, despite the monthly inflow at the border remaining at near-normal levels.
Traditionally, most sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would put their own stay in the country at risk.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would need to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal records.
Around 80 per cent of sponsors or their family members are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we are still pursuing these people,” said Albence.
In their drive to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month from the date of arrest, instead of 60 days, as was the norm previously, according to workers at the reception centres.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered eligible for asylum will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reports from the centres and the system itself, the longer they are detained, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to the defenders, these concerns are even more acute in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that children's signs of distress will be overlooked due to the size of the facility.
Furthermore, the move to camp without having given them enough time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on the "occupying forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's eight-year-old war.
Foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and the matter would be dealt with accordingly, Moualem said.
He said that they should be withdrawn immediately and without conditions.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories of terrorists and any foreign illegal presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily providing training and advice to the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-ravaged country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "planting irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay outside the country.
He said: "We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns."
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey averted a large-scale assault on Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made clear that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would focus on the jihadists, including the Nusra Front fighters, which he said would be "eliminated".
Staffan Mistura, the United Nations special envoy, is expected to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, a resignation or scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would surely be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever seen!
There are no signs of fatigue among the spectators at the moment.
Since 2014, CNN and MSNBC have seen their prime-time ratings double to 1.05 million and almost triple to 1.6 million, respectively.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in its prime-time audience, compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has surpassed cable news channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for its prime-time news programs.
Neal Baer, the executive producer of "Designated Survivor," a dramatic series on a secretary of state who becomes president after a Capitol attack, says, "It's an odd attraction that we still don't understand."
Veteran comedy writer Nell Scovell has another theory.
He recalled a taxi ride he took in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why?
Scovell was told "because it makes me laugh".
Chaos is always at a high level in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else that is seen on television, the arguments that come out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of immigrant families being able to reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information overloads you when you realize that you have been watching a panel of experts debating the use of "deep background" sources that Bob Woodward used for his book "Fear", the $15,000 ostrich skin jacket of Paul Manafort ("a piece of over-the-top pride", in the words of The Washington Post), and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
As far as I am concerned, I will never look at Mario in the same way again.
“Offering something new every night is in part what makes everything seem like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive producer of "Pawn Stars" and creator of "Pawn Stars," when he talks about the alternating Trump and daily plot lines (whether it's fighting the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode if you don't want to fall behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27 degrees on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC and CNN at the same time.
He could not tear himself away from the television, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
Fleiss recalls that in those days, "we were doing all these crazy things with our programmes and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilisation."
I thought it was all a joke, but in the end they were right.

Foreign money flows into the midterm elections of the most closely contested House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is receiving a flood of money thanks to the reorganization of a congressional district with two candidates seeking reelection to the same seat.
This residential district in Pittsburgh, which recently underwent a redesign, is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a special election in another district last spring.
Republican Keith Rothfus is Lamb's opponent for re-election, having represented the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been gerrymandered unconstitutionally in favour of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding battle between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic National Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight edge.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although it later backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight Washington caveat.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the management team of the Trump Organization was evicted.
State Department officials decided to recall the chiefs of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only El Salvador was sanctioned, which had already received around $140 million in US assistance in 2017 for, among other things, the control of drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial assistance and restrictions on certain visa categories, would have been very painful for Central America and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, the North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was similar to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials in the administration made clear that their intention was that the conference should go ahead, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a signal of the importance the administration has attached to the meeting.
The three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or reprisals from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House of Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the condition of anonymity.
Their explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under condition of anonymity.
History
The next step could be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump, which is already evident from the public record.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating the possibility that Trump's campaign was working in parallel with Russia on its attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable by this chamber, just as he is preparing to run for office again and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and I am not suggesting that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that his European equivalents will follow suit.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the length of the conflict.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler. All that was needed was for the West to have resisted and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History turns on these points of inflection, and the inexorable march of democracy accelerates or slows down.
Americans are now facing several of these tipping points.
What will we do if Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in a good place since this newspaper reported last year that he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculating about his inability to serve.
Rosenstein says The Times explanation is not accurate.
How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
On top of all that, will we vote in midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, we will be facing a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the same table decorated with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how could I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, optimistic ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal at the start of the month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League group stage.
A knee injury prevented Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the result can act as a springboard for bigger things.
We got a good result, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
We started the game believing we could get something and we came away with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall the draw was perhaps a fair result.
We were better in the first half, but after the break we came out fighting and were the better team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a tough game because they have already got a good result in the previous game. But with the support of the crowd, I am sure we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now there is a general feeling that everything will be OK.
The team is well, the boys are enjoying themselves a lot and we are having a good training session.
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.
The fear of retirement savings is keeping some women awake at night.
Despite the fact that the survey respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their families.
Around half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they talked to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they talked to their children about this.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the steps to have this conversation, says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these options can be a determining factor in the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversion, as he or she may also be able to help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Their long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover costs or to insure themselves with their own savings, as long as they have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of the legal battles.
Ensure that you have a power of attorney for medical care to designate a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the professionals are fulfilling your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate.
It can also prepare a power of attorney for its finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: imagine your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
Martin asks, "What kind of doctors do you have to treat?"
What medicines is he taking?
Who will look after the dog?
You have to plan everything.
A man is shot several times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
Several times a man has been shot with a rifle while walking home after leaving the house at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe (Devon) when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which happened around 02:30 (BST), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have made an appeal for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, officials said. The death toll is expected to rise.
With communications blocked, the relief workers have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, a northern area of Palu that is closer to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important details about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala Regency stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, which is a lower-level administrative region, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west coast of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Following is a summary of some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western coast of the province of Aceh in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on 26 December 2004 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake devastated the southern tip of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, recalling the devastation of the 2004 killer earthquake and tsunami.
This time, however, there was no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Lombok Island (Indonesia) was hit by a series of earthquakes of great magnitude, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the island's northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily displaced.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a police report released Saturday.
According to the police report, when a known acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone away from her.
Palin was booked into Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 cash bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked to make a statement, according to the chain.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could spend up to a year in prison and be fined $25,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a possible one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Sarah Palin, the mother of the victim, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska veterans court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence complaint, and possessing a firearm while under the influence of alcohol.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Several veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after a quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake has caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have collapsed and it is expected that the death toll will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just to the side of the centre of Sulawesi, which is located to the northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in the New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October 2017 attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed "intentionally" eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injuries, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", according to prosecutors, who described the way he carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as specified in the notice of intention.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last death penalty case was processed in the Southern District of New York.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal death penalty in New York was carried out in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the flag of ISIS to be flown in his hospital room, police said.
He has been acquitted of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said the defense team was "obviously disappointed" with the decision.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma for all those involved in these events.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of UKIP said politicians had to "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Theresa May in trying to reconcile her divided party has been highlighted even more since a group of Tory Brexiteers have joined a protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep the Chequers agreement on track in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and would force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and "chaos".
The Leave Means Leave MP, Chris Bone, said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a role in the negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I am going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile."
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is completely false."
The pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the protest, where she told reporters: "I just want to say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The public in general does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it and it is not popular with our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget Chequers and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: "First ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the crowd that if politicians were going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, they would have to feel the heat.
It was now a question of trust between the people and their political class, he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that they will not get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat."
We are going to mobilise the people's army of this country that gave us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, those in favour of the status quo had been out on the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved placards from the group after its launch this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with an application during the conference opening.
These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the IT systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the border in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland.
It is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be called a good Brexit”, he added.
Warren considers all possibilities for running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider all options for running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been much speculation about the possibility of Warren facing Trump in 2020.
The Saturday evening event in Holyoke was his 30th town hall meeting since Trump took office.
A member of staff asked if he was going to stand for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes having a woman at the top.
A man arrested for the murder of LSU football player Sims
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University in Baton Rouge early on Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death, said Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interview, Simpson admitted being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-metre-tall Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games last season, starting 10, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on the world title after his team handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton to pole position on Saturday, it was clear that the orders from Mercedes would play a key role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton out of the picture by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel was the first to enter the pits and left Hamilton to run in the back of the group, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes came out again a lap later and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a wheel-to-wheel move that left the Ferrari driver with no choice but to give up the inside line at risk of losing out later on in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 on that day, started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh in the first race.
He led a large part of the race while hanging on to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Räikkönen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered the boxes on lap 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps to regain fourth place from Raikkonen.
It has been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a true gentleman in letting me go.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect pair,” said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the Christine Blasey Ford letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in Virginia Western, the President did not directly refer to Mr. Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there were "bad, repugnant and false people."
The only thing that could happen and the good thing that is happening in the Senate right now is when you see anger, when you see bad people, disgusting people and false people.
When you read the publications and the leaks, and then they say "But I didn't do it."
I did not do that.
Do you remember?
Senator Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, oh!"
No.
I did not filter it.
Well, wait a minute.
Have we filtered...? No, we haven't filtered it, he said, imitating the senator.
A letter detailing Ford &apos; s allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
Senator Dianne Feinstein told the committee that she did not hide Dr Ford's allegations, nor did she filter her story, as reported by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and, therefore, I did.
But the president's refusal did not sit well with the president, who during the Saturday night rally said: "I'll tell you something: that was some bad body language."
Perhaps it did not, but that is the worst body language I have ever seen.
Continuing with his defence of the nominee of the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the repugnance, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step on to get power and control, according to the president, as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made amends for their Elite League defeat to Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took an early lead of two goals thanks to the attacking play of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the local game before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
This was the third defeat in a row for Adam Keefe's men in the Elite League, who had lost 2-1 to Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting between the two teams, of which the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what could be considered an early, lively period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt tied the game at 15:16 with Cownie.
Dwyer ensured the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalized the game with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee its first lead in the game in the second half and secure victory with the fifth goal of his team as the game approached the final whistle.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
A traffic controller dies so hundreds of people can escape on the plane in an earthquake
An air traffic controller from Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of people safely took off.
More than 800 people died and many more were missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to rock the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, where the tower was being affected by strong vibrations.
He ensured that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts break when we hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims will continue to rise, as there are still many bodies under the rubble and many people have not been able to be contacted.
Six-metre waves have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in by military and commercial aircraft.
35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance arrives with more bodies."
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help as much as possible the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation."
CNN reported that the team was ready.
Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok in the first half of this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the Micronesian air crash
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says one man has disappeared, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew had escaped safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday evening, there had been no sign of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk International Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
Jaynes said that was "extremely good".
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to wade through water that reached their waists to reach the emergency exits on the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said that the passengers on board panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said sailors working on nearby dock improvements also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to shore before the plane sank about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the PNG Civil Aviation Safety Authority indicate that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in PNG over the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
A chronology of the night a woman was burned alive is presented by an analyst.
The prosecution wrapped up its case in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The Department of Justice's Paul Rowlett, testifying as an expert in intelligence analysis, spent hours on the stand.
He showed the jury how he used the mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received data from several mobile phones that showed Chambers was with Tellis the night of his death, contradicting earlier statements by Tellis, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the phone data showed that Chambers' phone had been with Sanford's phone during the time Chambers said he was with Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford took the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city on that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers approximately two weeks before his death.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only met a week before.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted messages, calls and contact information for Chambers from his phone.
Hale said, "I erased her from my life."
The defence is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be handed over to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that hip hop has moved away from its roots in political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Acts like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for allegedly texting her a racist message after she was fired.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discrimination after receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple deny racism and compare the claim with a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her dismay at discovering that the new child care worker, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message: "NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON."
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "discomforted" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead he was expecting a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received his daily wage and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for wrongful dismissal with the intention of receiving $350 per day for the six months of internal work for which he had been hired, although without a contract.
He told The Post on Friday that he wanted to show them that things were not done that way, and added that "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was the most reasonable, as they feared that they could not trust him after having offended him.
My wife had sent him something he didn't want to say.
She is not racist.
Joel Plasco, the husband of the woman who was killed, told the Post: "We are not racists."
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had been rude to, even if it was an accident?
To your newborn?
Come on!”
Comparing the demand as "extortion", Plasco said his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to go for someone like that?
That is not a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still pending, the couple have been denounced on social media for their behaviour and their logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, revealed a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It was hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before publication."
It is very gratifying to know what we know now about the great success of Paddington.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC chambermaid before being inspired by a teddy bear to write a children's book, had hoped his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "a bit bittersweet" after his death last year.
She described Paddington as "a very important member of our family" and added that her father was very proud of her final success.
He was a very calm man who did not like to boast.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if he had a child who had achieved something important: you were proud of him, even though it was not really your achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although he created and owned Paddington, he always gave credit to his own imagination.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
As the plane landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
She regularly called to say that the situation was really bad, that she did not expect to succeed.
I received a call from Nad to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said: "Tashi, I love you very much."
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were running out and his system was shutting down.
She had died too soon and everything was going out.
I could only sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I could not howl, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold my ground.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience that was unfolding.
He said, "Nobody knew."
I bent my head and tears were constantly falling.
It is hard to explain, but it was on the flight where I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That I needed all my love and understanding.
He knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning put up cards to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, began to suffer from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
He said: "I don't want any father to feel what I feel every day."
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up any place.
However, he left his job before dying, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am constantly worried about the consequences."
Davis created the cards "so that people know there are people to go to and people to talk to, even if they are friends."
Don't keep it to yourself, you have to talk about it.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Davies' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been in a relationship for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
He said he was not depressed or anything like that.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to overcome it: "It leaves a void in the whole family."
It has left us devastated.
But we all have to keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"If we could actually get something like what he was asking for (a limited time frame, a limited scope), maybe we could bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "going off the rails" in the midst of a partisan stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
It is entirely due to the chronology.
Just five weeks remain until the mid-term elections on November 6. If, as expected, the Republicans have a bad showing, their efforts to elect the man they want for the Supreme Court will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
The numbers of North Korean deserters "fall" in line with Kim
The number of North Koreans defecting to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification in the South, said that there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high fees charged by traffickers, were the key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on this.
The vast majority of deserters from the north eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
Seúl says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers desertion to be illegal immigration rather than refugee status and, in many cases, people are repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on nuclear negotiations.
This followed the historic Singapore summit in June between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the lack of progress on US sanctions.
Without the trust of the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally, Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, said Brett Kavanaugh was a "histrionic" nominee and was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Pelosi said she could not stop thinking about what would have happened if a woman had acted in that way, and said, "They would have said she was hysterical."
Kavanaugh used his emotion to deny the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and choking while talking about his family and his years of secondary education.
In the committee, he also condemned explicitly Democrats, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and clearly coordinated smears" organized by some angry liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against Democrats.
I think he is doing himself a disservice with those statements and the way he has pursued the Clintons and Democrats.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would oppose Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and the Democrats gained a majority in the House.
Pelosi said: "I will say one thing: if he is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he will not be fit to be on the Supreme Court, and he will not be fit to be on the court he is on now."
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible rulings by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said, "This is not the time for a histrionic person and an impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is fine."
And women have to wield it.
It is a justified rant, months and years of fury overflowing, and she cannot let go without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's all that strange, do you?"
She continued: "A woman who was an executive in some company helped me a lot. She told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique whereby when she was angry and began to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to: "Perhaps you think I am crying because I am sad."
No, I am not angry.
And then he just kept on doing what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger because, in essence, they are not understood.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once when I found myself crying with an unexpressed rage. An older woman, a serious manager whom I had always been slightly afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up a staircase.
He told me, "Never let them see you cry."
They have no idea that you are furious.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they think they have cornered you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business, she had to withdraw from the presidential race, and Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with the idea of her running for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-considered decision," he said with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they did not need another one.
Someone referred to us as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As the campaign was already well advanced, it fell behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not enter the race again unless it raised two million dollars.
It was a lost cause.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do you think I get a discount?" he asked.
When she announced that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made fundraising difficult and focused on capturing voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
"It would have been logical to think that he had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to put on my gravestone?"
Did it "cry"?
The trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rupture between the countries could benefit Beijing, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning in early 2018 by imposing tariffs on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant climb took place this week with new tariffs that will affect $200 billion (£150 billion) in goods, which will tax half of the goods that enter the United States from China.
In all cases, Beijing has responded in kind, recently imposing tariffs of between five and 10 per cent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match the United States' attacks, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will back down soon.
To back down would mean giving in to demands, but to publicly submit to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the trade war between the United States and China could help China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could set the stage for a sudden economic downturn in either country is actually much more dangerous than what audiences have recognized so far, said Abigail Grace, associate fellow at the Center for New American Security, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.
Syria is ready to welcome back refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to welcome back refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions were improving.
The situation on the ground is today more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The government is still trying to restore areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees who had to leave their country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are still six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Syria's Foreign Minister said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had supported the insurgency.
Ryder Cup to be held in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since its last victory in the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe reclaimed the crown when Denmark's Thomas Bjorn captain's team won 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson, who had to fight most of the way through the tournament, threw his ball into the water on the par-3 16th hole, admitting defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 score since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States lost to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen, 5 and 4.
World number one Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio García, who has already won eight Ryder Cups, became the European player with the most points in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It has been a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to recover the trophy.
It was a team effort and I am very happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional García after the European team's victory.
Now it is the turn of his compatriot John Rahm, who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods by two and one in a singles match on Sunday.
I feel incredible pride in having beaten Tiger Woods, because I have grown up watching this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, and is only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played great golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance: "I am very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting."
There was a moment this morning when we heated up the situation in Europe.
But we ruined it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He is a great captain.
Their 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it is our turn to bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.”
Reduction of red tide concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The new Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission report (Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission) shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, irregular flowering conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting a reduction in concentrations.
The red tide bloom extends approximately 130 miles along the Pinellas County coast from the north to the south end of Lee County.
Irregular parcels can be found 10 miles inland from the coast of Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
Red tides have also been detected in Pasco County.
During the past week, concentrations of medium intensity were reported in Pinellas County and along its coast, low to moderate concentrations along the coast of Hillsborough County, low to moderate concentrations in Manatee County, low to moderate concentrations in Sarasota County and along its coast, low to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, low to moderate concentrations in Lee County and along its coast, and low to moderate concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory irritation in the northwest part of Florida during the past week.
