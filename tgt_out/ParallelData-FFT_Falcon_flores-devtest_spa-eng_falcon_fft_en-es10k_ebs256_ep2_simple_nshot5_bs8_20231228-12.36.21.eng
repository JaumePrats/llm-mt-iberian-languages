In the PALM trial, Zmapp's function was to control, i.e. the scientists used it as a base and compared it with the other three treatments.
USA Gymnastics supports the USOC statement and acknowledges that it is imperative that the Olympic family create a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and sports can be better served by making significant changes to our organization, rather than withdrawing certifications.

The USA Gymnastics and USOC goals are the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and enhanced environment.
During the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor and later for Lyndon B. Johnson's government.
He advised Carter on foreign policy in the 1976 elections. He later served as National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981, after Henry Kissinger.
As Carter &apos; s national security adviser, he helped manage the diplomatic handling of international affairs, such as the Camp David Accords of 1978, the normalization of relations between the United States and China in the 1970s, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which led to a hostage crisis in Iran, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, a widely accepted theory, it also provides specific data that fossils rarely offer, such as their colour and three-dimensional structure.
According to experts, this bird has a reddish-brown upper plumage and a pale or carotenoid lower plumage.
The discovery also helps to understand better the evolution of bird plumage.
Since the dinosaur plumage lacks a well-developed axis, called a ravisher, but does have other feather features (woolly and quill), the researchers concluded that the ravisher is likely the result of a subsequent evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but rather to temperature regulation or as an indicator of the same. The researchers argue that although the sample is from the tail of a young dinosaur, the analysed sample shows adult plumage features, not those of a chick.
The experts' comments were that, even though it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrated more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.
Yesterday, a car bomb in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and wounded more than 25 others.

Hu encouraged developing countries to "not go back to the traditional path of polluting first and cleaning up later".
He added: "It is not correct to expect them to take on responsibilities that exceed their stage of development, their level of responsibility and their capabilities."
The Iraq Study Group report was released at 12:00 GMT today.
It warns that no one can guarantee that any Iraqi action at this point will stop sectarian fighting, growing violence or a tendency towards chaos.
The report begins with a call for an open debate and consensus-building in the United States on Middle East policy.

While the programme was largely theoretical, it was written to simulate the observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The dark matter present in the galaxy and the Milky Way would be the forces behind the expected effect of the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts a gravitational pull on our planet and causes tides.
The experts concluded that dark matter is affected in the same way as regular matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter that surrounds a galaxy is located in a class of halo and consists of numerous small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant was "generating a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate".
Dr Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus within the hospital and that at least two of the infected workers were staff at that hospital.
In a year, an infected person can pass the virus on to between 10 and 15 people with whom they have had close contact.
However, the overall XDR-TB rate in the total TB population still appears to be low: 6 000 of a total of 333 000 individuals infected at a particular point in time in South Africa.

The first cases of the disease during this season were reported towards the end of July.
Pigs are the carriers of the disease, which then migrates to humans via mosquitoes.
The outbreak has led authorities in India to take measures such as the deployment of pig hunters, the distribution of millions of mosquito nets to the population and the use of pesticides in the most affected areas.
The authorities have also guaranteed millions of vaccine vials to fight against encephalitis, which will allow health care companies to prepare for the next year.
This year, the shortage of financial resources and the lack of prioritization, compared with other diseases, have resulted in delays in the delivery of the vaccination plans in historically vulnerable regions.

With the construction of the dam in 1963, seasonal flooding was reduced, leaving sediment along the river.
This sediment was necessary for the formation of sand banks and beaches, which in turn functioned as habitats for wild life.
As a result, two species of fish have become extinct and two others are at risk of extinction, including the cypha gila.
While the water level will only rise a few feet after the flood, authorities expect the water to rise to restore the degraded sandbars downstream.

The temperature variations during the night and day indicate that the caves are likely to be present.
During the day, its temperature is lower than that of the surrounding surface, and at night it is higher.
While its thermal behaviour is not as regular as that of the large caves on our planet, which tend to maintain a fairly stable temperature, it is consistent with the deep cavities in the ground that the USGS and Northern Arizona University (NAU) team have been studying.
In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a booth and place a pre-printed ballot in an envelope indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the ballot is placed in the ballot box and the voter signs the voters' list.
French electoral law is quite strict in its procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that there are no additional ballots at the start of voting and that only those of voters are added, properly counted and authorised.
Candidates have the right to send representatives to oversee each stage of the process, and at night the volunteers count the votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

The first was the slalom, where he finished "Did not finish first race", along with 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In the giant slalom, she finished 10th in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-placed Hungarian, Gyöngyi Dani.
Four sitting skiers failed to complete their races and a total of 45 of 117 slalom giant skiers failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the laptop and the mobile phone stolen.
The Deputy Inspector General, D.K. Arya, said: "We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop computer."
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
As Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki had stated, the accused had appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Despite there being three people inside the house at the time of the impact, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while emergency services removed the driver of the Audi TT red car from the vehicle.
Initially, he was transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody awaiting trial, any witness testimony may be subject to challenge, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but as the Scottish legal system works differently, the courts considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: "It seems that journalists are walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information about suspects."
The Crown Office, which handles prosecutions, said it would not be making any further comment until the indictment was issued.
According to the leaked information, the document will address the border conflict, which Palestine seeks to resolve based on the existing boundaries in advance of the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics, according to information received, included the future status of Jerusalem, which both countries regard as sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel requires a constant military presence in the valley for 10 years once the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the supplementary pest control trial, game wardens had to closely supervise shooters, as they were being monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
A partnership between NPWS and the NSW State Sporting Association (NSW) Shooting Program recruited suitable volunteers within the Association's hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is currently in charge of the NPWS Conservation and Heritage Office, said that comprehensive training and security briefings were provided to the four shooters selected for the operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC, for its English initials) of nine members.
In four years, it is the fifth CEP for Martelly.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the CEP to resign, as part of a series of measures aimed at steering the country towards new elections.
The commission was the way Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the fact that no elections had taken place, in some cases since 2011.
Approximately 60 iPods with malfunctioning and overheating issues have been reported, resulting in six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry had commented on the delay in the Apple report, saying it was "truly regrettable".
Mariana was shaken by a 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT) earthquake on Friday.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency reported no damage on the Northern Mariana Islands.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the Philippines capital, a former police officer held a bus and its passengers hostage from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against the foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
Both the six hostages, including children and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began studying medicine.
She received training in obstetrics and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in the early 1950s.
Liggins began his research into premature birth in his spare time, while working in the hospital.
His study showed that fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that government investigators had recovered the flight recorders from the black box.
Luna's fellow fighters also paid tribute.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. She died on the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman."
Dustin Runnels said: "Luna was as rare as me, even more so. I love her and will miss her. I hope she is in a better place."
Since 2008, the number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 per cent in the lead-up to the 2010 federal election.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic once the Queen Elizabeth II's term of office had ended.
34 per cent of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
At one end of the survey, 29 per cent of people believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other end, 31 per cent believe that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, was required to swim in the freestyle style in 100m and 200m, and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned following his complaints.
He has not been able to take painkillers because they are banned at the Games.
On 25 January, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Many people verified the discovery by using a variety of hardware and software and the discovery was announced on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets have been a source of water and organic matter for our planet, as well as the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The scientists' expectation is to understand how planets, including our own, are formed, given that comets have collided with Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office at the start of the year and last month signed a law allowing same-sex couples to marry.
He dismissed the rumours as "political gossip and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, that would reduce flight distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to the old radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate data.
There will be no additional transport and the trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking for cars and the deterrent will not be available.
Due to the concern over possible transport issues, the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors was considered, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, Science magazine reported on the discovery of a new species of bird on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Experts from Princeton University, in the United States, and Uppsala University, in Sweden, revealed that the new species had evolved in just two generations, despite the fact that it was thought to take much longer, due to the reproductive isolation between a Darwin's finch endemic, Geospiza fortis, and a cactus finch migrant, Geospiza scandens.
Gold can take any shape and be rolled into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and rolled into sheets, but it can also be stretched into a very fine wire that can be twisted and braided.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. So thin was it that it was used to decorate hand-made books called "manuscript illumination".
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice will change depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical product analysed determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron. Thus, a hydrogen ion is the result of removing a proton from an electron.
Mix both powders together and, after mixing, with clean and wet hands, form a ball.
A reaction between the moisture in his hands and their external layers will make them feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had in-house toilets with drainage in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated sewerage system.
In some homes in the cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had public baths in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, public baths had toilets and some were shared by men and women.
When one communicates with someone who is thousands of miles away, one is using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space via a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the light from Earth's atmosphere distorts part of the light and view we see.
A giant rocket is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us is to make travel much simpler and faster.
Thanks to her, we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to deer and elk.
Finally, there are many small wild cats, including domestic cats, that feed on small-bodied species in much greater abundance, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of its success is the concept of niche: each cat has a particular role, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of the big cats and live in large groups called prides.
A pack is formed by one to three adult males from the same family group, with up to 30 females and their offspring.
Generally, females are very close to each other, making them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave in a similar way to wolf packs or dogs, with a remarkable similarity (unlike other large cats) to their behaviour and lethality towards their prey.
The tiger is a full-time athlete, with the ability to climb (but not very well), swim, make long jumps and pull five times stronger than a strong person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These are the only four big cats capable of roaring.
The tiger's roar is not a full-throated roar like that of the lion, but rather a sentence spoken in growls and yells.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. In the ideal, they will hunt monkeys, rodents, birds and reptiles, with most prey being much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey (food) using their sense of smell, by smelling the ground where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and can move very stealthily, and they also hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one (e.g. if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island), they will often find themselves in a different environment to that which they are used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors, and therefore a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor.
No changes have been made to the original population, which still requires the same adaptations as in the past.
As the population adapts to the new environment, it begins to look less like the other population.
Finally, after millions or even billions of years, the two populations will be so different that they will no longer be classified as the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an ineluctable and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (which they emit).
Plant food is generated by solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and also make clothes from them. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without them, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, so nothing else gave it any concern, except other Mosasauridae.
His long, sharp teeth were capped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another group in his palate, which meant that anything that came his way had no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a viper. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and even could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water, even a T. Rex was no match for him.
While most of the food we would be familiar with, the Romans also ate some rather unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boar, pheasants, snails and even a type of rodent, the dormouse.
Another thing that distinguished the rich from the poor was that the poor ate sitting down on a chair, while the rich enjoyed sharing banquets and lying down while eating.
It is not possible that the recipes of ancient Rome included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
In short, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chocolate or Roman antiquities.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
People made sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and a sanctuary within which only the priests were allowed.
Sometimes, special towers with a pyramid shape were built, called ziggurats, to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the warm Middle East climate, the house was of little importance.
Most Jewish families spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just showrooms that faced the street. Houses were built with stone.
There were no large forests in Canaan; therefore, wood was very expensive.
Very few people lived in Greenland. According to the sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, during a journey westwards, discovered the island and named it.
Even so, the Inuit had already inhabited the area at that time.
While each country was "Scandinavian", there were significant differences in relation to the people, the monarchs, the habits and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Treasure Island, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. The reverse side of the document contains something written, but it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has the words "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776" written on the back, below the text.
Although it is not known who wrote it, it is known that the huge document (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up and stored.
Therefore, it is likely that the score was added only as a label.
While the D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, the south was still to be won.
His government was in the hands of the Vichy French, a group that, in 1940, had agreed to peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders rather than fighting against them.
On 15 August 1940, the "Dragon Operation" was launched, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, the American and French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together, in other words, a society.
Civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and relates both to the word civis, from the same language, which means citizen, and to civitas, which means city or city state and, in some way, determines the size of society.
The state capital is the precursor of the nation. A culture of civilization requires a long-term generational transmission of knowledge, a durable cultural legacy and a homogenous spread.
Minority cultures tend to disappear without leaving any significant historical traces, and are not recognized as civilisations in their own right.
During the American Revolution, the thirteen states formed, initially, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which Congress was the only component.
The Congress did not have the power to levy taxes, and since it had a national executive or judicial power, the function fell to the states, which often did not cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
It was not empowered to annul fiscal or customs laws between states.
The articles demanded unanimous approval from all states to amend the constitution and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives often did not attend.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports most popular are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, figure skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are more popular in the north, with athletes who compete in international tournaments and Olympic Games.
Japan has around 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world.
Due to the conglomerate/group of islands that it contains, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's history goes back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed through the area recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in southwestern Taiwan, marked the beginning of a transformation in the indigenous production method of grains, with the employment of Chinese labour to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty army (1644-1912) took control of the coastal and western regions of Taiwan in 1683 and declared this as a dependent province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after having been defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which retained control of the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is home to three major buildings: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been reconstructed to allow tourists to see how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 per cent of Machu Picchu had been restored and work continues today.
For example, the most common image-stabilized format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the most commonly used film size towards the end of the film era.
Today, it is still being produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship has been transferred to the digital camera sensor formats.
In fact, the 35 mm format is a bit confusing, as its dimensions are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Thus, the dimensional relationship of this format (dividing by 12 to calculate the simplest common divisor) is 3:2.
Many typical formats (e.g. the APS group) are similar or very similar to this relationship.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant ridicule and often mocked, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while also allowing for some order to be imposed on the images.
Indicates that the most effective position to place the central object is the intersection formed by the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity had succeeded in uniting European states, despite their different languages and customs.
His power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the common man.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds should be used for that specific purpose.
The central core of the church had remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money had led many to wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after hostilities began, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, such measures violated generally recognized international law and were contained in several recent international agreements.
Britain has pumped out water from entire ocean sectors to block the entry of ships, even putting neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response to this tactic, Germany believed it would face a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the majority of citizens and nations adopted a policy of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the countries wanted to ensure that such a situation would not be repeated in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at Edison in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his last manager) addressed to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Chinese had a unique way of delimiting different time periods. Each dynasty or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of instability within each dynasty, with provinces divided. The most well-known was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out among many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history was the Three Kingdoms, when thousands of people died in a struggle for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
Its political and social consequences are many, including the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, not to a single sovereign.
Likewise, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and prestigious to succeed.
The same is true of the military, where instead of basing charges on classes, they are now based on ability.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other people in the suppressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Mahoma was deeply interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which has endured over time, realistically illustrates the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the peak of one of the mountains to the north of Mecca lies a cave that is totally cut off from the rest of the world.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one is sure of its existence. Inside the cave, isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the many mountains in the vicinity. From within this cave, little or nothing of this world can be seen or heard.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century BC, is one of many pyramidal structures of great size and shape built to honour the deceased pharaoh.
The Valley of the Kings, or "Valley of the Kings", in the Valley of the Kings, Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honour of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many other pyramids and smaller tombs and temples were built in honour of his wives and family.
The "upward bow" mark is similar to a V and the "downward bow" mark is similar to a square or a triangle without its lower border.
Up means to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means to start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull it.
A rising arc produces a softer sound, while a descending arc is louder and more forceful.
Feel free to make your own marks with pencil, but please remember that the marks on stringed instruments have been printed in that place for a musical purpose, and should therefore be respected.
On 6 October 1789, a crowd of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, his wife Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and his sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd that shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At one point, a participant in the revolution shook the head of a beheaded guard in front of the Queen, who was in panic.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial US regime to cover most of the government's interest and bond payments.
From the outset, the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main source of profits for American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the context that led to the establishment of the order.
The historical period in which these events took place is known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses, pragmatically, a broad range of ideas, from technological imperative to a strict sense of there being a logic underlying the destiny of humanity and its relationship with the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development unfolds on an independent path from any cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
For example, one could argue that the existence of cars necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national network of roads is not economically viable for a small number of cars, so new manufacturing techniques are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread use of cars also leads to a higher incidence of traffic accidents, which in turn leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The cultural determinism element was very present in romanticism, as studies by Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel show.
In the Romantic context, geography moulded people and, over time, customs and cultures developed that were related to that geography and, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital today, Constantinople was known as such in feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury centre began approximately 400 BC and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its status declined, in part because, on their return, crusaders brought back gifts, such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than goods offered in Byzantine markets.
The title of "fashion capital" was then transferred, from then on, from Constantinople to Paris.
The pinnacle of the Gothic style occurred in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the way people dressed was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of this period was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is understood as that which aims to produce sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family alone.
Simple subsistence farming is a simple practice, usually organic, that combines the use of locally stored seeds with crop rotation or other simple methods to maximise production.
Historically, most farmers' main activity was subsistence farming, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures congregate individuals with similar ideas and feelings of social marginality and provide a means of generating a sense of identity.
Many factors can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
The distinguishing features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or related to religion or politics, or a combination of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit distinctive and symbolic style traits, such as distinctive and symbolic fashion, gestures and slang.
One of the most common ways to graphically illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at the few and unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild children". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the parents' rejection of a child with severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that wild children have suffered traumatic or severe abuse before being abandoned or fleeing.
It is said that others were raised by animals and some have lived in the wild.
When a child is raised exclusively by animals different from humans, it exhibits behaviour (within its physical capabilities) almost identical to that of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference towards people.
Even though project-based learning should make the process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a support that provides assistance to those who are experiencing a new experience, such as the use of a new computer programme or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented in either a real or virtual format; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffolding, but also a PowerPoint animation from Microsoft Office is a scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolding is built into the software and its function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have been complex for the student to understand on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care or education; but it happens.
We can see that the family-based system provides a safe space for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe, loving homes, consistent education and reliable medical care.
The purpose of family placement is to meet all needs that were not met in the home of the child prior to placement.
The Internet combines and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different characteristics of the Internet open up new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of "uses and rewards".
For example, learning and socialization are cited as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to web sites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), "personal involvement" and "long-term relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors.
Through video recording, important findings have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are brief facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by reading a person's microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether they are lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech", explained how those who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can, however, judge sincerity with precision.
It even suggests that human behaviour can be interpreted by animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research of the 20th century, it has been shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
The process of mutation incorporates a new genetic variation; the process of selection removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination deal with the variation between one generation and the next.
In the savannah, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is the same as a human, to meet its amino acid needs with the vegetable resources available to it.
Not doing so has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The proteins present in leaves and legumes would have been the easiest source of vegetable protein, but they are not easily digested by primates like us, except when cooked.
Animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
In the end, it should not surprise us if our own predecessors resolved their "protein problems" in the same way that chimpanzees do today.
The sleep interruption is waking up on purpose during the normal sleep period and then going back to sleep (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a softer alarm clock that will bring him back to a conscious state, but not fully awaken him.
The record is an additional requirement for the visa process in some countries, where you will need to register your presence and address with local authorities.
Other options that are based on biological rhythm include drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, a diuretic) before going to bed, which will make him get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person experiences is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the greater the positive force of life that we can tap into. Each one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
We can all achieve enlightenment. What stops us is our tension and negativity.
While the basis of Tibetan Buddhism is the teachings of Buddha, it has expanded along the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, the laísmo is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination) is activated through yoga postures, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on the Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, the energy channels can be unblocked, chakras activated and the consciousness of enlightenment developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the system, process and culture clashes between the two countries led to a distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies now became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought for real, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other places.
With the Polish defence already broken by 17 September 1939, Poland's only hope was to withdraw and reorganize in the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell out of use almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to do the same.
The Atlantic campaign in the Second World War provides one of the clearest and most recent examples of this. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could have taken power in Britain, just as it had done with the other European countries.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
With the aim of easily obtaining their milk, hair, meat and skin, the ancient peoples and tribes started to capture them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in herds that roamed the hills or other areas of grazing, tended by shepherd boys who were often children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd.</span>
In England, railways had been established in the 16th century.
Although the rails of the carts were made of simple parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling them to achieve a greater speed and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Early on, sleepers were used to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realised that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with iron at the top.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused more wear and tear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels, and in 1767 iron rails were introduced.
The first form of transport was walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
His predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While bipedal fossils have been found in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can begin to live more friendly with the planet, join environmental movements or even become activists and fight to reduce, in some way, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like as-needed treatment. But if we are not just looking for a temporary fix, we should find the root of the problem and try to deactivate it.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes, as a result of technological and scientific advances by humanity, and problems have intensified due to overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being approved by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft was sent to the printer, John Dunlap, a few blocks away.
Approximately 150 to 200 copies were made during the night, which are now known as the "Dunlap Copies".
John Nixon read the document for the first time in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on 8 July.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered it to be read to his army in New York on 9 July. Another copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 photographs by Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
A large number of palaeontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. They are birds.
Many people do not see them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many characteristics in birds that still make them look like dinosaurs.
They have clawed forelimbs and sharp teeth, lay eggs and move on their hind legs in the same way as the T-Rex.
Currently, most computers operate on a binary system, where data is coded under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1, and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning may be finding an open bottle of medicine or toxic cleaning products.
Read the label for specific information on the first aid relevant to this specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "parasite insect" in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its old relationship with fleas, a very developed species for parasiting humans.
Bedbugs and their nymphs are adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
The number of cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is estimated at around 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve, is the target of multiple sclerosis.
The studies showed that women had twice the chance of men of developing EH.
A couple might decide that raising a child was not the most appropriate thing for them or for the child.
These couples could choose to adopt a child.
In an adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that a different couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method is the guiding principle for most scientific research.
It is not an experiment, but a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was on the classics, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotelian thoughts, especially in the area of science, psychology, were accepted.
As the Greek language was declining, Western culture distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many of the rhythms present in physiological processes and behaviour depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The regular rhythms, which are not just responses to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate self-sustainably and have a free-running period, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA was a genetic material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacteria using phages, or viruses.
Two experiments were conducted in which they marked the DNA of the frog with radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the size of the affected DNA fragment and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts of the body can cause cellular death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, which includes wildlife and plant life.
Some examples of possible activities in the area are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and studying information on the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns in their cars to go to work and often meet others who have just left the place where they work.
In this dynamic transfer system, everyone is somehow connected to a system of private car use, and supports it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states, which has contributed to human evolution over the last two million years.
All are part of society and use the transport systems; and almost all complain about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear such complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
What is the reason for such complaints and why are they happening daily? Are the transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more substantial going on?
Traffic flow is the study of individual driver and vehicle movements between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, it is not easy to study traffic flow, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behaviour, which allows traffic flows to be logical and amenable to approximate mathematical representation.
In order to graphically illustrate the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Such relationships facilitate both the planning and design of road infrastructure as well as the operation of road vehicles.
The first insects to take to the air were the insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and a mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards, tucking them against their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of smaller places to hide from predators.
Currently, only the anisoptera and the ephemeroptera are unable to fold their wings.
Millennia ago, a man called Aristarco commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, as the Earth does not perceive its movement, correct?
The Amazon River is the most voluminous and the second longest river in the world. It contains 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, in some places with a width of up to six miles.
Of the total water flowing into the world's oceans, 20 per cent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River has a length of 6,387 km (3,994 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built throughout the Ancient Kingdom, they never surpassed the size or the sublime technique of their construction.
The ancient Egyptian town of New Kingdom was amazed by the monuments of its ancestors, which dated back more than a thousand years.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, the Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the least populous.
Italian is used in the Vatican for drafting its legislation and for issuing its official statements.
The language that most people working in the state speak on a daily basis is also Italian, and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All citizens living in the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper are known since antiquity, as they can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (with the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but it also had the theory that they transform into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are, basically, a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered to include elements such as calcium and potassium. Already, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
It is also possible that there are trace elements, such as carbon, which are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, composed of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of atoms is so impressively small that the end of this sentence could contain billions of them.
As a result, the pencil became a favourite.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Today, people write messages on their computer screens. They do not even need to approach a pencil.
Only time will tell what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy car rolls up a hill. Dividing the core once again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with the minimum or almost no push.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer shell is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
It is possible that there are more seas on the near side because its crust is thinner, which allowed the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on what attracts or pleases people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they have grown up to maturity.
These theories look at what makes some people want the things they do and what factors in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two very well known theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviour when managers start leading their former colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is the attempt to continue being "one of the boys" (or girls).
The managers in this category find it difficult to make decisions that are unpopular with employees, impose disciplinary measures, conduct performance reviews, assign responsibilities and demand accountability from staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person who believes that everything that the group has done so far must be changed and done in their own way.
In the end, the success and failure of the team is ultimately down to the leader.
This behaviour often leads to the leaders of the other team members being distanced from the leader.
The same standards of excellence apply to virtual teams as to conventional teams, but there are some small differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their physical team.
They generally enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, as their teams can meet at different times, for example, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of an 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: p. 109) is also a unique feature of virtual teams.
The "invisible team" is the group responsible for management and to which each member reports. It sets the standards for each member.
What would motivate an organization to submit to the process of establishing a learning organization? One of the purposes of applying the concepts of organizational learning is to stimulate innovation.
When all available resources are used appropriately in an organization's operational departments, space is created for creativity and ingenuity.
This may lead to an organization that works together to overcome a place-based challenge to innovate in order to meet the needs of customers.
To be innovative, leadership must first create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
The continuous approach is explained in Angel (2006) as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide empirical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research. They therefore reduce the field of research and increase its accuracy.
The link between brain pathology and behaviour contributes to the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in mental functioning.
Thanks to the rise of new technologies, we now have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to develop simulation models, which help us to understand the mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant field within computer science, which deals with intelligent behaviour, learning and adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and scheduling, diagnostic and consultation capabilities, facial recognition, handwriting and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial Intelligence is now used in many sectors of the economy, medicine, engineering and the military, just as it was incorporated into various software applications for video games and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
The solution comes from technology, through virtual tours. Students can see the exhibits in a museum, visit an aquarium or view beautiful works of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital and each year the website is updated, but the previous versions are archived online as a memory book.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. Even though students often begin their blogging experience with a lack of care in grammar and spelling, this usually changes when they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical readers, the blogger starts to try to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also requires students to be more understanding of the world around them. The need to engage the audience inspires them to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspire collaboration and encourage students to go beyond the typical school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through active response to internet content, students can define their positions in the context of other people's writings, and establish their perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the bilingual capital of Canada and is home to a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the country's history and present-day culture.
The Niagara Falls are further south and the natural beauty of Muskoka and the extension that follows are further north.
All these aspects, and others, make Ontario intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wilderness, almost uninhabited.
For a comparison that causes many to be surprised, more African Americans live in the United States than in Canada.
The location of the African Eastern Islands is off the eastern coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is, by far, the largest island in the world, and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or associated with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury tourist complexes.
Islam was also brought to the islands by Arabs and has largely been imposed in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial impact of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the route linking Europe with India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female visitors state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to use a ring (just make sure it doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and not be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, that is not correct!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and Carthaginians used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese with the name of White House, but was abandoned in 1755 after a quake.
The city was rebuilt by Sultan Mohammed of Morocco under the name Daru l-Badya and the Spanish traders who set up their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in Morocco to go shopping.
Traditional Moroccan wares are sold in abundance in the surrounding area of the old Medina, including earthenware, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of trinkets, but everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist destination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside the city should be considered in order to take stock of the situation in the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu province.
The city is the base for scaling the Nyiragongo volcano and its gorilla trekking excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To move within Goma, you can take a moto-taxi (motorbike taxi). The regular fare (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, coupled with its relative inaccessibility, has given Tombuctú a reputation as an exotic and distant land.
While Tombuctú is now a poor city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the World Heritage List, due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the highlights of the special Maravillas del mundo africano, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab style than African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends along the eastern border with Mozambique, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which has a different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognised as the icon of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African nature reserves, there are daily rates for conservation and access to the park.
It is also possible to buy a Wild Card which allows entry to private game reserves in South Africa or to all the National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is the main attraction for most tourists.
The skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a bar chart of a light-up graph that shows the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
The best way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to Kowloon Bay, which is located on the opposite side.
It is in the reclaimed land of the north coast of Hong Kong where the city's dense urban development is concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. So if you want to see evidence of the past colonial past of this region, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The Indian section of the forest is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
Despite this, the forests are not just mangroves, but also contain some of the last remaining trees of the once-impressive forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2 and is approximately one-third covered by water or wetlands.
The Sundarbans have been a sanctuary for wildlife since 1966 and are estimated to be home to 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave the bus station between districts (on the other side of the river) all day, but most, especially those travelling east to Jakar (also called Bumthang) and west to Thimphu, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Due to the frequent overcrowding of buses between districts, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts have the Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the river, connecting Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two 3.5 m wide lanes.
Below the bridge there is a 15-metre-wide gap, and although the bridge was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is expected by September 2017, which is when it is expected that Brazilian customs controls will be completed.
The area that is now eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guarani, who were the largest indigenous group in that region and who lived as nomadic hunters in addition to practising subsistence farming.
The Guaycurú and Payaguá indigenous groups in the region hunted, gathered and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Province of India", was born in the 16th century, as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native Indian peoples.
Spanish colonization began, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its aboriginal identity and character.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Other tournaments and lower-level matches may also be seen throughout the year.
Information on the Association Argentine Polo website about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The Falkland Islands pound (FKP) is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands. You can change your money there. It is in front of the West FIC store in Stanley.
Sterling is generally accepted anywhere on the islands. In Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
There is a chance that credit cards will not be accepted on the islands of the periphery, but cash British or American dollars will be accepted. Ask the owners in advance to be able to define the accepted payment method.
It is virtually impossible to change money outside the Falkland Islands, so do so before leaving.
Due to the fact that Montevideo is south of Ecuador, there is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the tropics, with frequent summer temperatures of +30°C.
Cold winter weather can be deceptive: although it is very rare for temperatures to fall below the freezing point, wind and humidity interact to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" stations; rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild life remains wild, so do not feed it or obstruct it.
According to the authorities of the parks, the minimum distance from bears and wolves is 100 yards/meters, and from other wild animals 25 yards/meters.
Despite their gentle appearance, bison, bighorn sheep, elk, bears and most large animals can be aggressive.
Hundreds of visitors are injured every year by not maintaining a safe distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that bears and other wild animals are attracted to smells, so you should avoid cooking or eating foods that release a lot of smell and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa, Apia, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of approximately 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank, except for a British cruiser. Around 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the Mau movement's war for independence, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the state chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches in Auckland due to the city having two ports. The most well-known are in three areas.
In the North Harbour district of the Pacific Ocean, the North Shore beaches stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas and most have pohutukawa trees providing shade.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive, the extravagant Mission Bay and St Heliers suburbs, and the central Auckland region are all on display at the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family beaches, sometimes very busy, with numerous and varied shops available. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather refreshing and pleasant.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, New Zealand and Australian wines may be considered better for transport.
The local water from the tap is completely safe for consumption, but if you are concerned, you can easily find bottled water.
The Australians consider the idea of "white coffee" foreign. A small black coffee is called "espresso", cappuccinos are served with cream (rather than foam) and tea is not served with milk.
Belgian chocolate is up to standard. Fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year and, there, shark bites are rare.
However, take the advice of the authorities, respect all the signals and pay special attention to security alerts.
Jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries of rivers from October to April, north of 1770.
Tigers do exist, but almost never attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not found in the ocean, but in the estuaries of rivers to the north of Rockhampton.
The pre-booking of accommodation gives you the peace of mind that you will have somewhere to stay when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, but through them it is also possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Generally, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers from and to the airport, and even combined flight and accommodation packages.
They can also hold the offer for you if you need time to think about it, or if you need other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of attendees camped at the event and most of the audience considered camping to be a key part of the experience.
If you want to see the action up close, then you will need to arrive early to stake out a spot near the music events.
Please note that, while the musical performances may have finished, other areas of the festival may continue into the early hours of the morning.
Some festivals have family camping areas, for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic in winter, check where the bridge is, as crossing ice causes a very annoying noise for the most affected.
During the St. Petersburg cruises, time is spent in the city. Visa requirements are waived for those who disembark (see terms).
Casinos normally go to great lengths to maximise the time and money their customers spend. There are no windows or clocks and exits can be difficult to find.
Special food, drink and entertainment promotions are often offered to keep guests in good spirits and within the premises.
Some establishments serve free spirits. Although drunkenness affects judgment, a good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone intending to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should expect the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On ice or snow covered roads, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as one would on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, a large amount of snow can fall, leaving you trapped in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by snow or ice on the car windows.
In many countries, ice and snow are normal and traffic flows almost without interruption throughout the year.
Safaris are likely to be the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable for many visitors.
The term &quot; safari &quot; is used to describe the popular African wildlife-viewing trips by land, particularly in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are known to approach vehicles and the standard equipment will provide good visibility.
Sometimes leopards, lions and jaguars can be shy, so you will have a better chance of seeing them using binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as "hiking", "safari on foot" or "walk") is a walking expedition, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. A number of events will take place in other parts of Japan.
Host of the 1964 sporting event, Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games.
If you have already booked your flights and accommodation for 2020, you may face complications.
There are different types of travel cancellation policies, but since the end of March, coverage for most of these coronavirus-based travel policies does not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most entries to events will cost between JPY 2,500 and JPY 130,000 and that common passes will cost JPY 7,000.
Wet clothes can be ironed to help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and board for guests, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a board available, or if you don't want to use a planed board, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Do not let the fabric overheat, as it may shrink or even catch fire in extreme cases.
Various methods are available for purifying water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, all you need to do is boil water for a minute, in others, you need to boil it for several more.
Not all filters are equally effective, and if this is a concern, bottled water with a certified seal should be considered.
It is possible that travellers may encounter plague-bearing animals in regions from which they have not been reported.
Pests can ruin food, cause irritation or, in more serious cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, in themselves, or dangerous animals, which can injure or kill individuals by the use of their strength, are not usually included in the category of pests.
The free importation of customs duty offers an opportunity to acquire, in certain places, duty-free and tax-free products.
Tax-haven travellers can sometimes save a significant amount of money, particularly on items such as spirits and tobacco.
The stretch of Interstate 70 between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging stretch of road and often traverses remote and isolated terrain.
If you don't normally drive on rural roads, keep your eyes open: there are many steep hills, narrow lanes and tight corners.
The speed limits are lower than on the previous sections and those that follow, typically 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and strict compliance is even more important than on any other section.
However, curiously, the signal for cell phones is much better here than in many other sections of the road such as Pennsylvania Wilds.

The stirrups are the supports for the riders' feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
While providing greater stability for the rider, they can present security issues as the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he or she can be dragged if the horse bolts. To reduce the risk, there are a number of safety nets.
First, most riders use riding boots with a flat sole and a fairly narrow heel.
There are also English saddles with security bars that allow the leathers to come away from the saddle structure if a rider who has been thrown is pulled back.

Imagine the ski slope as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, it will be able to cover slightly longer distances than if it were walking, but very rarely will it reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Travelling between several countries would mean having to deal with visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area works as a single country in this respect.
Generally, once you move within this region, you will be able to cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, he does not need to apply for separate permits for each of the member countries of this space. This will save him time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, with the upper age limit being more restricted in places like North America than in Europe.
Artisan-made products may be classified as antiques, even though they are newer than goods of similar character manufactured in bulk.
Reno breeding is a vital source of income for many in Lapland and the culture surrounding this commercial activity is important to many who are not involved in other professions.
